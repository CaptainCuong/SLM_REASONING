{"question": "If $A$ and $B$ are vertices of a polyhedron, define the distance $d(A,B)$ to be the minimum number of edges of the polyhedron one must traverse in order to connect $A$ and $B$.

The number of digits in $243$ is 3. The number of digits in $10^{15}$ is 16. Therefore, the number of digits in $N$ is $3 + 16 = 19$.\n\nWe can also use logarithms to find the number of digits in $N$.\n$\\log_{10} N = \\log_{10} (8^5 \\cdot 5^{10} \\cdot 15^5) = 5 \\log_{10} 8 + 10 \\log_{10} 5 + 5 \\log_{10} 15 = 5 \\log_{10} (2^3) + 10 \\log_{10} 5 + 5 \\log_{10} (3 \\cdot 5) = 5(3 \\log_{10} 2) + 10 \\log_{10} 5 + 5 (\\log_{10} 3 + \\log_{10} 5) = 15 \\log_{10} 2 + 10 \\log_{10} 5 + 5 \\log_{10} 3 + 5 \\log_{10} 5 = 15(0.3010) + 10(0.6990) + 5(0.4770) + 5(0.6990) = 4.515 + 6.990 + 2.385 + 3.495 = 13.385$.\nThe number of digits in $N$ is $\\lfloor \\log_{10} N \\rfloor + 1 = \\lfloor 13.385 \\rfloor + 1 = 13 + 1 = 14$.\n\nLet's check the calculation again.\n$\\log_{10} N = 5 \\log_{10} 8 + 10 \\log_{10} 5 + 5 \\log_{10} 15 = 5 \\log_{10} (2^3) + 10 \\log_{10} 5 + 5 \\log_{10} (3 \\cdot 5) = 5(3 \\log_{10} 2) + 10 \\log_{10} 5 + 5 (\\log_{10} 3 + \\log_{10} 5) = 15 \\log_{10} 2 + 10 \\log_{10} 5 + 5 \\log_{10} 3 + 5 \\log_{10} 5 = 15(0.3010) + 10(0.6990) + 5(0.4770) + 5(0.6990) = 4.515 + 6.990 + 2.385 + 3.495 = 13.385$.\nThe number of digits in $N$ is $\\lfloor \\log_{10} N \\rfloor + 1 = \\lfloor 13.385 \\rfloor + 1 = 13 + 1 = 14$.\n\nWe have $8^5 \\cdot 5^{10} \\cdot 15^5 = (2^3)^5 \\cdot 5^{10} \\cdot (3 \\cdot 5)^5 = 2^{15} \\cdot 5^{10} \\cdot 3^5 \\cdot 5^5 = 2^{15} \\cdot 3^5 \\cdot 5^{15} = (2 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 5)^5 \\cdot 2^{10} \\cdot 5^{10} = (30)^5 \\cdot 2^{10} \\cdot 5^{10} = 30^5 \\cdot (2 \\cdot 5)^{10} = 30^5 \\cdot 10^{10} = (3 \\cdot 10)^5 \\cdot 10^{10} = 3^5 \\cdot 10^{15} = 243 \\cdot 10^{15}$.\nThe number of digits is $5 + 10 = 15$.

The final answer can be simplified in the form $m \\sqrt{n}$, where $m$ and $n$ are positive integers and $n$ without square factore. What is $m+n$?", "generated_responses": ["Let the sides of the triangle be $a, b, c$ in increasing order. Since the sides are in arithmetic progression, we can write $a = b-d$ and $c = b+d$ for some $d > 0$. We are given that $a=6$, so $6 = b-d$. Also, the triangle has an angle of $120^\\circ$, which we assume is the angle opposite side $c$. Then by the Law of Cosines, we have $c^2 = a^2 + b^2 - 2ab \\cos(120^\\circ)$. Since $\\cos(120^\\circ) = -\\frac{1}{2}$, we have $c^2 = a^2 + b^2 + ab$. Substituting $a=6$ and $c=b+d$, we get $(b+d)^2 = 6^2 + b^2 + 6b$, so $b^2 + 2bd + d^2 = 36 + b^2 + 6b$. This simplifies to $2bd + d^2 = 36 + 6b$, so $d^2 - 6b + 2bd = 36$. We can rewrite this as $d^2 + 2bd - 6b = 36$.\n\nWe can solve for $d$ using the quadratic formula: $d = \\frac{-2b \\pm \\sqrt{4b^2 - 4(36 - 6b)}}{2} = \\frac{-2b \\pm \\sqrt{4b^2 - 144 + 24b}}{2} = \\frac{-2b \\pm \\sqrt{4(b^2 + 6b - 36)}}{2} = -b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 + 6b - 36}$. Since $d > 0$, we take the positive root: $d = -b + \\sqrt{b^2 + 6b - 36}$.\nSince $6 = b-d$, we have $d = b-6$. Thus, $b-6 = -b + \\sqrt{b^2 + 6b - 36}$, so $2b-6 = \\sqrt{b^2 + 6b - 36}$. Squaring both sides, we get $(2b-6)^2 = b^2 + 6b - 36$, so $4b^2 - 24b + 36 = b^2 + 6b - 36$. This gives $3b^2 - 30b + 72 = 0$. Dividing by 3, we get $b^2 - 10b + 24 = 0$. Factoring, we get $(b-6)(b-4) = 0$. Thus, $b=6$ or $b=4$. Since $a=6$, we must have $b > 6$, so $b=6$ is not possible. Therefore, $b=4$. Then $d = b-6 = 4-6 = -2$, which is not possible since $d>0$.\n\nLet's assume the angle of $120^\\circ$ is opposite side $a$. Then $a^2 = b^2 + c^2 - 2bc \\cos(120^\\circ) = b^2 + c^2 + bc$. Since $a=6$, we have $36 = b^2 + c^2 + bc$. Also, $a, b, c$ are in arithmetic progression, so $a = b-d$ and $c = b+d$. Then $36 = (b-d)^2 + b^2 + (b+d)^2 + (b-d)(b+d) = b^2 - 2bd + d^2 + b^2 + b^2 + 2bd + d^2 + b^2 - d^2 = 3b^2 + d^2$. Thus, $36 = 3b^2 + d^2$. Since $a=6$, we have $6 = b-d$, so $d = b-6$. Substituting this into the equation $36 = 3b^2 + d^2$, we get $36 = 3b^2 + (b-6)^2 = 3b^2 + b^2 - 12b + 36$. This simplifies to $4b^2 - 12b = 0$, so $4b(b-3) = 0$. Thus, $b=0$ or $b=3$. Since $b$ must be a side length, we must have $b=3$. Then $d = b-6 = 3-6 = -3$, which is not possible.\n\nLet the sides be $a, b, c$ in increasing order. Then $a=6$. Let the angle between $b$ and $c$ be $120^\\circ$. Then $a^2 = b^2 + c^2 - 2bc \\cos(120^\\circ) = b^2 + c^2 + bc$. So $36 = b^2 + c^2 + bc$. Also, $a, b, c$ are in arithmetic progression, so $b = a+d = 6+d$ and $c = a+2d = 6+2d$. Substituting these into the equation $36 = b^2 + c^2 + bc$, we get $36 = (6+d)^2 + (6+2d)^2 + (6+d)(6+2d) = 36 + 12d + d^2 + 36 + 24d + 4d^2 + 36 + 12d + 2d^2 = 108 + 48d + 7d^2$. Thus, $7d^2 + 48d - 72 = 0$. Using the quadratic formula, we get $d = \\frac{-48 \\pm \\sqrt{48^2 - 4(7)(-72)}}{2(7)} = \\frac{-48 \\pm \\sqrt{2304 + 2016}}{14} = \\frac{-48 \\pm \\sqrt{4320}}{14} = \\frac{-48 \\pm \\sqrt{144 \\cdot 30}}{14} = \\frac{-48 \\pm 12\\sqrt{30}}{14} = \\frac{-24 \\pm 6\\sqrt{30}}{7}$. Since $d>0$, we take the positive root: $d = \\frac{-24 + 6\\sqrt{30}}{7}$. Then $b = 6+d = 6+\\frac{-24+6\\sqrt{30}}{7} = \\frac{42-24+6\\sqrt{30}}{7} = \\frac{18+6\\sqrt{30}}{7}$ and $c = 6+2d = 6+2(\\frac{-24+6\\sqrt{30}}{7}) = 6+\\frac{-48+12\\sqrt{30}}{7} = \\frac{42-48+12\\sqrt{30}}{7} = \\frac{-6+12\\sqrt{30}}{7}$.\nThe area of the triangle is $\\frac{1}{2}bc \\sin(120^\\circ) = \\frac{1}{2}bc \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2} = \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{4}bc$. We have $bc = (6+d)(6+2d) = 36 + 12d + 6d + 2d^2 = 36 + 18d + 2d^2$. Substituting $d = \\frac{-24+6\\sqrt{30}}{7}$, we get $bc = 36 + 18(\\frac{-24+6\\sqrt{30}}{7}) + 2(\\frac{-24+6\\sqrt{30}}{7})^2 = 36 + \\frac{-432+108\\sqrt{30}}{7} + 2\\frac{576 - 288\\sqrt{30} + 360}{49} = 36 + \\frac{-432+108\\sqrt{30}}{7} + \\frac{936 - 576\\sqrt{30}}{49} = \\frac{252 - 432 + 108\\sqrt{30} + 936 - 576\\sqrt{30}}{49} = \\frac{252 - 432 + 936 - 468\\sqrt{30}}{49} = \\frac{756 - 468\\sqrt{30}}{49}$. This is not correct.\n\nLet $a=6$, $b=6+d$, $c=6+2d$. Then $a^2 = b^2 + c^2 - 2bc \\cos(120^\\circ)$, so $36 = (6+d)^2 + (6+2d)^2 + (6+d)(6+2d) = 36 + 12d + d^2 + 36 + 24d + 4d^2 + 36 + 12d + 2d^2 = 108 + 48d + 7d^2$. Thus $7d^2 + 48d - 72 = 0$. $d = \\frac{-48 \\pm \\sqrt{48^2 - 4(7)(-72)}}{2(7)} = \\frac{-48 \\pm \\sqrt{2304 + 2016}}{14} = \\frac{-48 \\pm \\sqrt{4320}}{14} = \\frac{-48 \\pm 12\\sqrt{30}}{14} = \\frac{-24 \\pm 6\\sqrt{30}}{7}$.

What is the original (before discount) price of the most expensive shoes he could afford to buy?", "generated_responses": ["Let $P$ be the original price of the running shoes.\nThe price of the running shoes on sale is $P - 0.20P = 0.80P$.\nThe sales tax is $7.5\\%$ of the discounted price, so the tax is $0.075(0.80P) = 0.06P$.\nThe total cost of the running shoes is the discounted price plus the tax, which is $0.80P + 0.06P = 0.86P$.\nCarlos had $43$ dollars, so the total cost must be less than or equal to $43$.\nThus, we have the inequality $0.86P \\le 43$.\nDividing both sides by $0.86$, we get $P \\le \\frac{43}{0.86} = \\frac{4300}{86} = \\frac{2150}{43} \\approx 50.465$.\nSince the price must be in dollars, we round down to the nearest dollar.\nThe original price of the most expensive shoes Carlos could afford to buy is $50$.\n\nWe check our answer.\nIf the original price is $50$, the discounted price is $50(1 - 0.20) = 50(0.80) = 40$.\nThe tax is $40(0.075) = 3$.\nThe total cost is $40 + 3 = 43$.\nSince the total cost is exactly $43$, the original price of the most expensive shoes Carlos could afford to buy is $50$.\n\nFinal Answer: The final answer is $\\boxed{50}$"], "id": 36, "generated_answers": ["50"], "gold_answer": "50.0", "is_correct": true, "answers_correctness": [true]}
