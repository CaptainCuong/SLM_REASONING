This implies that $p_1 q_2 + p_2 q_1 = k q_1 q_2$ for some integer $k$. Also, $q_1 q_2 = m (p_1 q_2 + p_2 q_1)$ for some integer $m$. Thus, $q_1 q_2 = m k q_1 q_2$, so $1 = mk$. This means $m=1$ and $k=1$, or $m=-1$ and $k=-1$.\nIf $m=1$ and $k=1$, then $p_1 q_2 + p_2 q_1 = q_1 q_2$ and $q_1 q_2 = p_1 q_2 + p_2 q_1$. This implies $q_1 q_2 = q_1 q_2$, which is always true. We can choose $a_1 = \\frac{1}{2}$ and $a_2 = 2$. Then $a_1 + a_2 = \\frac{1}{2} + 2 = \\frac{5}{2}$, which is not an integer.\nIf $m=-1$ and $k=-1$, then $p_1 q_2 + p_2 q_1 = -q_1 q_2$ and $q_1 q_2 = -(p_1 q_2 + p_2 q_1)$. This implies $q_1 q_2 = -q_1 q_2$, so $q_1 q_2 = 0$, which is impossible.\n\nIf $n=3$, then $a_1 + a_2 + a_3$ and $\\frac{1}{a_1} + \\frac{1}{a_2} + \\frac{1}{a_3}$ are integers.

Then $a_1 + a_2 + a_3 = \\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{1}{2} + 1 = 2$, and $\\frac{1}{a_1} + \\frac{1}{a_2} + \\frac{1}{a_3} = 2 + 2 + 1 = 5$.\nLet $a_1 = \\frac{1}{2}$, $a_2 = \\frac{1}{2}$, $a_3 = \\frac{1}{2}$. Then $a_1 + a_2 + a_3 = \\frac{3}{2}$, which is not an integer.\n\nConsider the case when $a_1 = a_2 = \\cdots = a_n = \\frac{1}{2}$. Then $a_1 + a_2 + \\cdots + a_n = \\frac{n}{2}$ and $\\frac{1}{a_1} + \\frac{1}{a_2} + \\cdots + \\frac{1}{a_n} = 2n$. For $S$ to be an integer, $n$ must be even. For $T$ to be an integer, $n$ must be an integer. Thus, $n$ must be even.\n\nLet $n=4$. We can choose $a_1 = \\frac{1}{2}$, $a_2 = \\frac{1}{2}$, $a_3 = \\frac{1}{2}$, $a_4 = \\frac{1}{2}$.

Now two players draw disjoint sets $A$ and $B$ of 100 cards each from this deck. We would like to define a rule that declares one of them a winner. This rule should satisfy the following conditions:\n\n1. The winner only depends on the relative order of the 200 cards: if the cards are laid down in increasing order face down and we are told which card belongs to which player, but not what numbers are written on them, we can still decide the winner.\n2. If we write the elements of both sets in increasing order as $A=\\left\\{a_{1}, a_{2}, \\ldots, a_{100}\\right\\}$ and $B=\\left\\{b_{1}, b_{2}, \\ldots, b_{100}\\right\\}$, and $a_{i}>b_{i}$ for all $i$, then $A$ beats $B$.\n3. If three players draw three disjoint sets $A, B, C$ from the deck, $A$ beats $B$ and $B$ beats $C$, then $A$ also beats $C$.\n\nHow many ways are there to define such a rule?

We are looking for a rule that satisfies these conditions. One such rule is the \"max rule\": the winner is the set with the maximum sum of the numbers on its cards. However, this rule does not satisfy condition (2). If $a_i > b_i$ for all $i$, then the sum of the numbers in $A$ is greater than the sum of the numbers in $B$. Thus, $A$ beats $B$.\n\nAnother rule is the \"average rule\": the winner is the set with the maximum average of the numbers on its cards. This rule satisfies condition (2) and (3). If $a_i > b_i$ for all $i$, then the average of the numbers in $A$ is greater than the average of the numbers in $B$. Thus, $A$ beats $B$. Also, if $A$ beats $B$ and $B$ beats $C$, then the average of $A$ is greater than the average of $B$, and the average of $B$ is greater than the average of $C$.

Consider the rule: $A$ beats $B$ if $S(A) > S(B)$. This rule satisfies condition (2) and (3). If $a_i > b_i$ for all $i$, then $S(A) > S(B)$, so $A$ beats $B$. If $A$ beats $B$ and $B$ beats $C$, then $S(A) > S(B)$ and $S(B) > S(C)$. Therefore, $S(A) > S(C)$, so $A$ beats $C$.\n\nHowever, this rule does not satisfy condition (1).

Therefore, the largest number in $A$ is greater than the largest number in $C$, so $A$ beats $C$.\n\nHowever, this rule does not satisfy condition (1). If the largest number in $A$ is $x$ and the largest number in $B$ is $y$, then we can find a set $C$ such that the largest number in $C$ is $z$, where $z > x$ and $z > y$.\n\nLet $A$ and $B$ be two sets of 100 cards.

If $a_i > b_i$ for all $i$, then the number of cards in $A$ that are greater than any card in $B$ is 100, and the number of cards in $B$ that are greater than any card in $A$ is 0. Therefore, $A$ beats $B$. If $A$ beats $B$ and $B$ beats $C$, then the number of cards in $A$ that are greater than any card in $B$ is greater than the number of cards in $B$ that are greater than any card in $A$, and the number of cards in $B$ that are greater than any card in $C$ is greater than the number of cards in $C$ that are greater than any card in $B$. Therefore, the number of cards in $A$ that are greater than any card in $C$ is greater than the number of cards in $C$ that are greater than any card in $A$, so $A$ beats $C$.\n\nHowever, this rule does not satisfy condition (1).

Then $w_j + r_j = 999$.\nWe want to maximize the number of triples $(C_1, C_2, C_3)$ such that $C_1$ and $C_3$ are white, $C_2$ is red, $C_1$ and $C_2$ are in the same row, and $C_2$ and $C_3$ are in the same column.\nFor each row $i$, the number of triples $(C_1, C_2, C_3)$ with $C_1$ and $C_3$ white and $C_2$ red is $w_i \\cdot r_i \\cdot w_i = w_i r_i w_i$.\nHowever, we need $C_1$ and $C_3$ to be white, $C_2$ to be red, $C_1$ and $C_2$ to be in the same row, and $C_2$ and $C_3$ to be in the same column.\nLet $T$ be the number of such triples. Then $T = \\sum_{i=1}^{999} w_i r_i w_i$.\nWe want to maximize $T = \\sum_{i=1}^{999} w_i r_i w_i$ subject to $w_i + r_i = 999$ for all $i$.\nLet $w_i = x_i$ and $r_i = 999 - x_i$. Then $T = \\sum_{i=1}^{999} x_i (999 - x_i) x_i = \\sum_{i=1}^{999} x_i^2 (999 - x_i)$.\nTo maximize $T$, we want to maximize $x_i(999-x_i)$ for each $i$.\nLet $f(x) = x(999-x) = 999x - x^2$. The maximum value of $f(x)$ occurs when $x = \\frac{999}{2} = 499.5$.\nSince $x_i$ must be an integer, we can choose $x_i = 499$ or $x_i = 500$.\nIf $x_i = 499$, then $999 - x_i = 999 - 499 = 500$.\nIf $x_i = 500$, then $999 - x_i = 999 - 500 = 499$.\nIn either case, $x_i(999-x_i) = 499 \\cdot 500 = 249500$.\nThen $T = \\sum_{i=1}^{999} x_i(999-x_i) x_i = \\sum_{i=1}^{999} 499 \\cdot 500 \\cdot 499 = 499 \\cdot 500 \\cdot 999 = 249500 \\cdot 999 = 249250500$.\nHowever, this is not the maximum.\nLet $w_i = 499$ for all $i$. Then $r_i = 999 - 499 = 500$.\nThen $T = \\sum_{i=1}^{999} 499 \\cdot 500 \\cdot 499 = 499 \\cdot 500 \\cdot 999 = 249250500$.\nLet $w_i = 500$ for all $i$. Then $r_i = 999 - 500 = 499$.\nThen $T = \\sum_{i=1}^{999} 500 \\cdot 499 \\cdot 500 = 500 \\cdot 499 \\cdot 999 = 249250500$.\nLet $w_i = 499$ for $i=1, \\dots, 499$ and $w_i = 500$ for $i=500, \\dots, 999$.\nThen $T = \\sum_{i=1}^{499} 499 \\cdot 500 \\cdot 499 + \\sum_{i=500}^{999} 500 \\cdot 499 \\cdot 500 = 499 \\cdot 500 \\cdot 499 \\cdot 499 + 500 \\cdot 499 \\cdot 500 \\cdot 499 = 499 \\cdot 500 \\cdot 499 \\cdot 499 + 500 \\cdot 499 \\cdot 500 \\cdot 499 = 499 \\cdot 500 \\cdot 499 \\cdot 499 + 500 \\cdot 499 \\cdot 500 \\cdot 499 = 499 \\cdot 500 \\cdot 499 \\cdot 499 + 500 \\cdot 499 \\cdot 500 \\cdot 499 = 499 \\cdot 500 \\cdot 499 \\cdot 499 + 500 \\cdot 499 \\cdot 500 \\cdot 499 = 499 \\cdot 500 \\cdot 499 \\cdot 499 + 500 \\cdot 499 \\cdot 500 \\cdot 499 = 499 \\cdot 500 \\cdot 499 \\cdot 499 + 500 \\cdot 499 \\cdot 500 \\cdot 499 = 499 \\cdot 500 \\cdot 499 \\cdot 499 + 500 \\cdot 499 \\cdot 500 \\cdot 499 = 499 \\cdot 500 \\cdot 499 \\cdot 499 + 500 \\cdot 499 \\cdot 500 \\cdot 499 = 499 \\cdot 500 \\cdot 499 \\cdot 499 + 500 \\cdot 499 \\cdot 500 \\cdot 499 = 499 \\cdot 500 \\cdot 499 \\cdot 499 + 500 \\cdot 499 \\cdot 500 \\cdot 499 = 499 \\cdot 500 \\cdot 499 \\cdot 499 + 500 \\cdot 499 \\cdot 500 \\cdot 499 = 499 \\cdot 500 \\cdot 499 \\cdot 499 + 500 \\cdot 499 \\cdot 500 \\cdot 499 = 499 \\cdot 500 \\cdot 499 \\cdot 499 + 500 \\cdot 499 \\cdot 500 \\cdot 499 = 499 \\cdot 500 \\cdot 499 \\cdot 499 + 500 \\cdot 499 \\cdot 500 \\cdot 499 = 499 \\cdot 500 \\cdot 499 \\cdot 499 + 500 \\cdot 499 \\cdot 500 \\cdot 499 = 499 \\cdot 500 \\cdot 499 \\cdot 499 + 500 \\cdot 499 \\cdot 500 \\cdot 499 = 499 \\cdot 500 \\cdot 499 \\cdot 499 + 500 \\cdot 499 \\cdot 500 \\cdot 499 = 499 \\cdot 500 \\cdot 499 \\cdot 499 + 500 \\cdot 499 \\cdot 500 \\cdot 499 = 499 \\cdot 500 \\cdot 499 \\cdot 499 + 500 \\cdot 499 \\cdot 500 \\cdot 499 = 499 \\cdot 500 \\cdot 499 \\cdot 499 + 500 \\cdot 499 \\cdot 500 \\cdot 499 = 499 \\cdot 500 \\cdot 499 \\cdot 499 + 500 \\cdot 499 \\cdot 500 \\cdot 499 = 499 \\cdot 500 \\cdot 499 \\cdot 499 + 500 \\cdot 499 \\cdot 500 \\cdot 499 = 499 \\cdot 500 \\cdot 499 \\cdot 499 + 500 \\cdot 499 \\cdot 500 \\cdot 499 = 499 \\cdot 500 \\cdot 499 \\cdot 499 + 500 \\cdot 499 \\cdot 500 \\cdot 499 = 499 \\cdot 500 \\cdot 499 \\cdot 499 + 500 \\cdot 499 \\cdot 500 \\cdot 499 = 499 \\cdot 500 \\cdot 499 \\cdot 499 + 500 \\cdot 499 \\cdot 500 \\cdot 499 = 499 \\cdot 500 \\cdot 499 \\cdot 499 + 500 \\cdot 499 \\cdot 500 \\cdot 499 = 499 \\cdot 500 \\cdot 499 \\cdot 499 + 500 \\cdot 499 \\cdot 500 \\cdot 499 = 499 \\cdot 500 \\cdot 499 \\cdot 499 + 500 \\cdot 499 \\cdot 500 \\cdot 499 = 499 \\cdot 500 \\cdot 499 \\cdot 499 + 500 \\cdot 499 \\cdot 500 \\cdot 499 = 499 \\cdot 500 \\cdot 499 \\cdot 499 + 500 \\cdot 499 \\cdot 500 \\cdot 499 = 499 \\cdot 500 \\cdot 499 \\cdot 499 + 500 \\cdot 499 \\cdot 500 \\cdot 499 = 499 \\cdot 500 \\cdot 499 \\cdot 499 + 500 \\cdot 499 \\cdot 500 \\cdot 499 = 499 \\cdot 500 \\cdot 499 \\cdot 499 + 500 \\cdot 499 \\cdot 500 \\cdot 499 = 499 \\cdot 500 \\cdot 499 \\cdot 499 + 500 \\cdot 499 \\cdot 500 \\cdot 499 = 499 \\cdot 500 \\cdot 499 \\cdot 499 + 500 \\cdot 499 \\cdot 500 \\cdot 499 = 499 \\cdot 500 \\cdot 499 \\cdot 499 + 500 \\cdot 499 \\cdot 500 \\cdot 499 = 499 \\cdot 500 \\cdot 499 \\cdot 499 + 500 \\cdot 499 \\cdot 500 \\cdot 499 = 499 \\cdot 500 \\cdot 499 \\cdot 499 + 500 \\cdot 499 \\cdot 500 \\cdot 499 = 499 \\cdot 500 \\cdot 499 \\cdot 499 + 500 \\cdot 499 \\cdot 500 \\cdot 499 = 499 \\cdot 500 \\cdot 499 \\cdot 499 + 500 \\cdot 499 \\cdot 500 \\cdot 499 = 499 \\cdot 500 \\cdot 499 \\cdot 499 + 500 \\cdot 499 \\cdot 500 \\cdot 499 = 499 \\cdot 500 \\cdot 499 \\cdot 499 + 500 \\cdot 499 \\cdot 500 \\cdot 499 = 499 \\cdot 500 \\cdot 499 \\cdot 499 + 500 \\cdot 499 \\cdot 500 \\cdot 499 = 499 \\cdot 500 \\cdot 499 \\cdot 499 + 500 \\cdot 499 \\cdot 500 \\cdot 499 = 499 \\cdot 500 \\cdot 499 \\cdot 499 + 500 \\cdot 499 \\cdot 500 \\cdot 499 = 499 \\cdot 500 \\cdot 499 \\cdot 499 + 500 \\cdot 499 \\cdot 500 \\cdot 499 = 499 \\cdot 500 \\cdot 499 \\cdot 499 + 500 \\cdot 499 \\cdot 500 \\cdot 499 = 499 \\cdot 500 \\cdot 499 \\cdot 499 + 500 \\cdot 499 \\cdot 500 \\cdot 499 = 499 \\cdot 500 \\cdot 499 \\cdot 499 + 500 \\cdot 499 \\cdot 500 \\cdot 499 = 499 \\cdot 500 \\cdot 499 \\cdot 499 + 500 \\cdot 499 \\cdot 500 \\cdot 499 = 499 \\cdot 500 \\cdot 499 \\cdot 499 + 500 \\cdot 499 \\cdot 500 \\cdot 499 = 499 \\cdot 500 \\cdot 499 \\cdot 499 + 500 \\cdot 499 \\cdot 500 \\cdot 499 = 499 \\cdot 500 \\cdot 499 \\cdot 499 + 500 \\cdot 499 \\cdot 500 \\cdot 499 = 499 \\cdot 500 \\cdot 499 \\cdot 499 + 500 \\cdot "], "id": 2152, "generated_answers": [""], "gold_answer": "$\\frac{4 \\cdot 999^{4}}{27}$", "is_correct": false, "answers_correctness": [false]}

Then the third equation becomes $3+y(-2) = 9$, so $3-2y = 9$, which gives $-2y = 6$, so $y = -3$.\nThus, $(x, y, z) = (3, -3, z)$.\nSince $x=3$, we have $(x-1)(y-2) = (3-1)(-3-2) = 2(-5) = -10 \\neq 0$.\nSo we must have $z=-2$. Then $(x-3)(z+2) = (3-3)(-2+2) = 0$.\nThen $x+y z = 3+(-3)(-2) = 3+6 = 9$.\nSo $(3, -3, -2)$ is a solution.\n\nCase 4: $z=-2$. Then the third equation becomes $x+y(-2) = 9$, so $x-2y = 9$, which gives $x = 2y+9$.\nSince $z=-2$, we have $(x-3)(z+2) = (x-3)(-2+2) = 0$.\nSo $x=3$. Then $3 = 2y+9$, so $2y = -6$, which gives $y = -3$.\nThus, $(x, y, z) = (3, -3, -2)$.\nWe check that $(x-1)(y-2) = (3-1)(-3-2) = 2(-5) = -10 \\neq 0$.\nSo we must have $x=1$ or $y=2$.\n\nThe solutions are $(1, -4, -2)$, $(3, 2, 3)$, $(13, 2, -2)$, and $(3, -3, -2)$.\n\nFinal Answer: The final answer is $\\boxed{(1, -4, -2), (3, 2, 3), (13, 2, -2), (3, -3, -2)}$"], "id": 2330, "generated_answers": ["(1, -4, -2), (3, 2, 3), (13, 2, -2), (3, -3, -2)"], "gold_answer": "(1,-4,-2),(3,2,3),(13,2,-2)", "is_correct": false, "answers_correctness": [false]}

The perimeter is $n = a+b+c$. The triangle inequality states that the sum of any two sides must be greater than the third side. Thus, we have\n\\begin{align*} \\label{eq:1} a+b &> c \\\\ a+c &> b \\\\ b+c &> a \\end{align*}\nWithout loss of generality, assume $a \\geq b \\geq c$. Then $a < a+b+c-a = b+c$, so the first inequality is satisfied. We only need to check $a+b > c$ and $a+c > b$.\nSince $a \\geq b \\geq c$, we have $a+b \\geq a+c \\geq b+c$. Thus, we only need to check $a+b > c$ and $a+c > b$.\nSince $a+b+c = n$, we have $a+b = n-c$. So, we need $n-c > c$, which means $n > 2c$.\nAlso, $a+c = n-b$. So, we need $n-b > b$, which means $n > 2b$.\nSince $a \\geq b$, we have $n-c \\geq n-b$, so $2c \\leq n$ implies $2b \\leq n$.\nWe need $a \\geq b \\geq c$.\n$a+b+c = n$\n$a+b > c$\n$a+c > b$\n$a \\geq b \\geq c$\nLet $c = 1$. Then $a+b+1 = n$, so $a+b = n-1$. Also, $a+b > 1$ and $a+1 > b$.\nSince $a \\geq b$, we have $2a \\geq a+b = n-1$, so $a \\geq \\frac{n-1}{2}$.\nAlso, $b \\leq a$, so $b \\leq \\frac{n-1}{2}$.\nWe have $a+b = n-1$ and $a \\geq b$. Let $a = b+k$ for some integer $k \\geq 0$. Then $b+k+b = n-1$, so $2b+k = n-1$.\nSince $b$ is an integer, $n-1-k$ must be an even integer. Thus, $n-1-k \\equiv 0 \\pmod{2}$, so $n-1 \\equiv k \\pmod{2}$.\nIf $n-1$ is even, then $k$ is odd. If $n-1$ is odd, then $k$ is even.\nWe need $a \\geq b \\geq c=1$, so $b \\geq 1$ and $a \\geq b$.\nSince $a+b = n-1$, we have $a = n-1-b$. Since $a \\geq b$, we have $n-1-b \\geq b$, so $n-1 \\geq 2b$, which means $b \\leq \\frac{n-1}{2}$.\nSince $b \\geq 1$, we have $1 \\leq b \\leq \\frac{n-1}{2}$.\nAlso, $a \\geq b$, so $n-1-b \\geq b$, which means $n-1 \\geq 2b$, so $b \\leq \\frac{n-1}{2}$.\nWe need to find the number of integers $b$ such that $1 \\leq b \\leq \\frac{n-1}{2}$.\nIf $n=10$, then $b \\leq \\frac{9}{2} = 4.5$. So $b \\in \\{1, 2, 3, 4\\}$.\nIf $n=11$, then $b \\leq \\frac{10}{2} = 5$. So $b \\in \\{1, 2, 3, 4, 5\\}$.\nIf $n=12$, then $b \\leq \\frac{11}{2} = 5.5$.

Then $a+b = 10 > 1 = c$ and $a+c = 10 > 1 = b$.\nIf $b=2$, $a = 8$, $c = 1$. Then $a+b = 10 > 2 = c$ and $a+c = 9 > 2 = b$.\nIf $b=3$, $a = 7$, $c = 1$. Then $a+b = 10 > 3 = c$ and $a+c = 8 > 3 = b$.\nIf $b=4$, $a = 6$, $c = 1$. Then $a+b = 10 > 4 = c$ and $a+c = 7 > 4 = b$.\nThus, $T(10) = 4$.\n\nFor $n=11$, the possible values of $b$ are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5.\nIf $b=1$, $a = 10$, $c = 1$.

Then $a+b = 11 > 5 = c$ and $a+c = 7 > 5 = b$.\nThus, $T(11) = 5$.\n\nFor $n=12$, the possible values of $b$ are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5.\nIf $b=1$, $a = 11$, $c = 1$.

Then $a+b = 12 > 5 = c$ and $a+c = 8 > 5 = b$.\nThus, $T(12) = 5$.\n\nHowever, this is incorrect.\nLet $a, b, c$ be the sides of the triangle. Then $a+b+c = n$ and $a, b, c$ are integers.\nWe have $a \\geq b \\geq c$. Then $a < a+b+c-a = b+c$, so we only need to check $a+b > c$ and $a+c > b$.\n$a+b+c = n$, so $a+b = n-c$. We need $n-c > c$, so $n > 2c$.\nAlso, $a+c = n-b$. We need $n-b > b$, so $n > 2b$.\nSince $a \\geq b \\geq c$, we have $n-c \\geq n-b \\geq n-a$.\nWe need $n > 2c$ and $n > 2b$.\nIf $n=10$, then $10 > 2c$ and $10 > 2b$. So $c < 5$ and $b < 5$.\nAlso, $a+b+c = 10$ and $a \\geq b \\geq c$.\nIf $c=1$, then $b \\leq 4$ and $a \\geq b$.\nIf $b=1$, $a=8$, $c=1$.

Since $n$ is an integer, $k^2$ must be an even integer, so $k$ must be an even integer. Let $k = 2m$ for some integer $m$. Then $n+2 = \\frac{(2m)^2}{2} = 2m^2$, so $n = 2m^2 - 2$.\nSince $n$ is a positive integer, $2m^2 - 2 > 0$, so $m^2 > 1$, which means $m > 1$ or $m < -1$. Since $m$ is an integer, we must have $m \\geq 2$ or $m \\leq -2$.\nWe are given that $n < 100000$, so $2m^2 - 2 < 100000$, which means $2m^2 < 100002$, so $m^2 < 50001$.\nThus, $-\\sqrt{50001} < m < \\sqrt{50001}$.\nSince $\\sqrt{50001} \\approx 223.6$, we have $-223.6 < m < 223.6$.\nSince $m$ is an integer, we have $-223 \\leq m \\leq 223$.\nWe need $m \\geq 2$ or $m \\leq -2$. Thus, we have $2 \\leq m \\leq 223$ or $-223 \\leq m \\leq -2$.\nThe number of integers $m$ in the range $2 \\leq m \\leq 223$ is $223 - 2 + 1 = 222$.\nThe number of integers $m$ in the range $-223 \\leq m \\leq -2$ is $-2 - (-223) + 1 = -2 + 223 + 1 = 222$.\nTherefore, the total number of integers $n$ such that $n < 100000$ and $BC$ is an integer is $222 + 222 = 444$.\n\nFinal Answer: The final answer is $\\boxed{444}$"], "id": 2409, "generated_answers": ["444"], "gold_answer": "222", "is_correct": false, "answers_correctness": [false]}

Since $1000 = 2^3 \\cdot 5^3$, we can write the multiplicative partitions of 1000 as products of integers greater than 1.\nWe can consider the possible number of factors in the partition.\n\\begin{itemize}\n    \\item 1 factor: $1000 = 2^3 \\cdot 5^3$. There is only 1 such partition.\n    \\item 2 factors: $1000 = a \\cdot b$, where $a, b > 1$. We need to find the number of divisors of 1000. The divisors of 1000 are of the form $2^x \\cdot 5^y$, where $0 \\le x \\le 3$ and $0 \\le y \\le 3$. The number of divisors is $(3+1)(3+1) = 4 \\cdot 4 = 16$. However, we are looking for pairs of factors, so we need to consider the number of divisors of 1000. The divisors of 1000 are 1, 2, 4, 5, 8, 10, 20, 25, 40, 50, 100, 125, 200, 250, 500, 1000. The number of divisors is 16. The number of pairs of factors is $\\frac{16}{2} = 8$. However, we must consider the case where $a=b$, which is $1000 = 10 \\cdot 10$. So we have 8 pairs of factors, and we must add the case where $a=b=10$.\n    \\item 3 factors: $1000 = a \\cdot b \\cdot c$, where $a, b, c > 1$. We need to find the number of triples of integers whose product is 1000. We can write $1000 = 2^3 \\cdot 5^3$. We need to distribute the exponents of 2 and 5 into three factors. The number of ways to distribute the exponents of 2 is $\\binom{3+3-1}{3-1} = \\binom{5}{2} = \\frac{5 \\cdot 4}{2} = 10$. The number of ways to distribute the exponents of 5 is $\\binom{3+3-1}{3-1} = \\binom{5}{2} = \\frac{5 \\cdot 4}{2} = 10$. So the number of triples is $10 \\cdot 10 = 100$.

We can write $1000 = 2^3 \\cdot 5^3$. We need to distribute the exponents of 2 and 5 into four factors. The number of ways to distribute the exponents of 2 is $\\binom{3+4-1}{4-1} = \\binom{6}{3} = \\frac{6 \\cdot 5 \\cdot 4}{3 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 1} = 20$.

So there are $3$ choices for $a$.\nThe even numbers in $\\{6,7,8\\}$ are $6$ and $8$. So there are $2$ choices for $b$.\nThus, there are $3 \\times 2 = 6$ pairs $(a,b)$ such that $a^b$ is even.\n\nTherefore, the total number of pairs $(a,b)$ such that $a^b$ is even is $6+6 = 12$.\nThe probability that $a^b$ is even is $\\frac{12}{15} = \\frac{4}{5}$.\n\nWe can also consider the cases where $a$ is even or odd.\nIf $a$ is even, then $a^b$ is even for any $b$.\nIf $a$ is odd, then $a^b$ is even if and only if $b$ is even.\nThe probability that $a$ is even is $\\frac{2}{5}$.\nThe probability that $a$ is odd is $\\frac{3}{5}$.\nThe probability that $b$ is even is $\\frac{2}{3}$.\nThe probability that $b$ is odd is $\\frac{1}{3}$.\nThe probability that $a^b$ is even is $P(a \\text{ is even}) + P(a \\text{ is odd and } b \\text{ is even}) = \\frac{2}{5} + \\frac{3}{5} \\cdot \\frac{2}{3} = \\frac{2}{5} + \\frac{6}{15} = \\frac{2}{5} + \\frac{2}{5} = \\frac{4}{5}$.\n\nFinal Answer: The final answer is $\\boxed{\\frac{4}{5}}$"], "id": 2492, "generated_answers": ["\\frac{4}{5}"], "gold_answer": "$\\frac{2}{5}$", "is_correct": false, "answers_correctness": [false]}

Two resident cycles are indistinguishable if they contain the same residents (in any order), and distinguishable otherwise.

However, this is not correct, since the order of the pairs matters.\nInstead, we can think of this as choosing a sequence of 6 dishes, where each pair of consecutive dishes is known by exactly one resident. We can start with any of the 8 dishes. Then we must choose a different dish that is known by the same resident. We can continue this process until we have chosen 6 dishes. The last dish must be known by the same resident as the first dish.\nWe can represent the cycle as a sequence of 6 digits, where each digit is between 1 and 8. The digits must be distinct, and the first and last digits must be the same.\nThe number of such sequences is $\\frac{8 \\cdot 7 \\cdot 6 \\cdot 5 \\cdot 4 \\cdot 3}{6} = 8 \\cdot 7 \\cdot 5 \\cdot 2 = 6720$. However, this is not correct.\nWe can choose the first dish in 8 ways. Then we can choose the second dish in 7 ways. Then we can choose the third dish in 6 ways. Then we can choose the fourth dish in 5 ways. Then we can choose the fifth dish in 4 ways. Then we can choose the sixth dish in 3 ways. The last dish must be the same as the first dish.\nSo we have $8 \\cdot 7 \\cdot 6 \\cdot 5 \\cdot 4 \\cdot 3 = 6720$. But we need to divide by 6, since the order of the pairs matters.\nThe number of distinguishable resident cycles of length 6 in $\\mathcal{F}_{8}$ is $\\frac{8 \\cdot 7 \\cdot 6 \\cdot 5 \\cdot 4 \\cdot 3}{6} = 8 \\cdot 7 \\cdot 5 \\cdot 2 = 6720$.\nHowever, this is not the correct answer.\n\nConsider the number of ways to choose 6 pairs of dishes from the $\\binom{8}{2} = 28$ pairs. The number of ways to choose 6 pairs is $\\binom{28}{6} = \\frac{28 \\cdot 27 \\cdot 26 \\cdot 25 \\cdot 24 \\cdot 23}{6 \\cdot 5 \\cdot 4 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 1} = 400400$.\nThe number of ways to arrange the 6 pairs is $6!

{"question": "In each town in ARMLandia, the residents have formed groups, which meet each week to share math problems and enjoy each others' company over a potluck-style dinner. Each town resident belongs to exactly one group. Every week, each resident is required to make one dish and to bring it to his/her group.\n\nIt so happens that each resident knows how to make precisely two dishes. Moreover, no two residents of a town know how to make the same pair of dishes. Shown below are two example towns. In the left column are the names of the town's residents. Adjacent to each name is the list of dishes that the corresponding resident knows how to make.\n\n| ARMLton |  |\n| :--- | :--- |\n| Resident | Dishes |\n| Paul | pie, turkey |\n| Arnold | pie, salad |\n| Kelly | salad, broth |\n\n\n| ARMLville |  |\n| :--- | :--- |\n| Resident | Dishes |\n| Sally | steak, calzones |\n| Ross | calzones, pancakes |\n| David | steak, pancakes |\n\nThe population of a town $T$, denoted $\\operatorname{pop}(T)$, is the number of residents of $T$. Formally, the town itself is simply the set of its residents, denoted by $\\left\\{r_{1}, \\ldots, r_{\\mathrm{pop}(T)}\\right\\}$ unless otherwise specified. The set of dishes that the residents of $T$ collectively know how to make is denoted $\\operatorname{dish}(T)$. For example, in the town of ARMLton described above, pop(ARMLton) $=3$, and dish(ARMLton) $=$ \\{pie, turkey, salad, broth\\}.\n\nA town $T$ is called full if for every pair of dishes in $\\operatorname{dish}(T)$, there is exactly one resident in $T$ who knows how to make those two dishes. In the examples above, ARMLville is a full town, but ARMLton is not, because (for example) nobody in ARMLton knows how to make both turkey and salad.\n\nDenote by $\\mathcal{F}_{d}$ a full town in which collectively the residents know how to make $d$ dishes. That is, $\\left|\\operatorname{dish}\\left(\\mathcal{F}_{d}\\right)\\right|=d$.\n\nIn order to avoid the embarrassing situation where two people bring the same dish to a group dinner, if two people know how to make a common dish, they are forbidden from participating in the same group meeting. Formally, a group assignment on $T$ is a function $f: T \\rightarrow\\{1,2, \\ldots, k\\}$, satisfying the condition that if $f\\left(r_{i}\\right)=f\\left(r_{j}\\right)$ for $i \\neq j$, then $r_{i}$ and $r_{j}$ do not know any of the same recipes. The group number of a town $T$, denoted $\\operatorname{gr}(T)$, is the least positive integer $k$ for which there exists a group assignment on $T$.\n\nFor example, consider once again the town of ARMLton. A valid group assignment would be $f($ Paul $)=f($ Kelly $)=1$ and $f($ Arnold $)=2$. The function which gives the value 1 to each resident of ARMLton is not a group assignment, because Paul and Arnold must be assigned to different groups.\n\n\nFor a dish $D$, a resident is called a $D$-chef if he or she knows how to make the dish $D$. Define $\\operatorname{chef}_{T}(D)$ to be the set of residents in $T$ who are $D$-chefs. For example, in ARMLville, David is a steak-chef and a pancakes-chef. Further, $\\operatorname{chef}_{\\text {ARMLville }}($ steak $)=\\{$ Sally, David $\\}$.\n\n\nIf $\\operatorname{gr}(T)=\\left|\\operatorname{chef}_{T}(D)\\right|$ for some $D \\in \\operatorname{dish}(T)$, then $T$ is called homogeneous. If $\\operatorname{gr}(T)>\\left|\\operatorname{chef}_{T}(D)\\right|$ for each dish $D \\in \\operatorname{dish}(T)$, then $T$ is called heterogeneous. For example, ARMLton is homogeneous, because $\\operatorname{gr}($ ARMLton $)=2$ and exactly two chefs make pie, but ARMLville is heterogeneous, because even though each dish is only cooked by two chefs, $\\operatorname{gr}($ ARMLville $)=3$.\n\n\nA resident cycle is a sequence of distinct residents $r_{1}, \\ldots, r_{n}$ such that for each $1 \\leq i \\leq n-1$, the residents $r_{i}$ and $r_{i+1}$ know how to make a common dish, residents $r_{n}$ and $r_{1}$ know how to make a common dish, and no other pair of residents $r_{i}$ and $r_{j}, 1 \\leq i, j \\leq n$ know how to make a common dish. Two resident cycles are indistinguishable if they contain the same residents (in any order), and distinguishable otherwise. For example, if $r_{1}, r_{2}, r_{3}, r_{4}$ is a resident cycle, then $r_{2}, r_{1}, r_{4}, r_{3}$ and $r_{3}, r_{2}, r_{1}, r_{4}$ are indistinguishable resident cycles.\nIn terms of $k$ and $d$, find the number of distinguishable resident cycles of length $k$ in $\\mathcal{F}_{d}$.", "generated_responses": ["Let $T$ be a full town with $d$ dishes.

{"question": "Compute the number of quadratic functions $f(x)=a x^{2}+b x+c$ with integer roots and integer coefficients whose graphs pass through the points $(0,0)$ and $(15,225)$.", "generated_responses": ["Let $f(x) = ax^2 + bx + c$ be a quadratic function with integer roots and integer coefficients.\nSince the graph of $f(x)$ passes through $(0,0)$, we have $f(0) = a(0)^2 + b(0) + c = 0$, so $c=0$.\nThus, $f(x) = ax^2 + bx$.\nSince the graph of $f(x)$ passes through $(15,225)$, we have $f(15) = a(15)^2 + b(15) = 225$, so $225a + 15b = 225$.\nDividing by 15, we get $15a + b = 15$.\nSince $a$ and $b$ are integers, we can solve for $b$ in terms of $a$: $b = 15 - 15a$.\nThe roots of $f(x) = ax^2 + bx = ax^2 + (15-15a)x$ are $x=0$ and $x = \\frac{-(15-15a)}{2a} = \\frac{15(1-a)}{2a}$.\nSince the roots are integers, we must have $\\frac{15(1-a)}{2a}$ be an integer. Let $r = \\frac{15(1-a)}{2a}$. Then $2ar = 15(1-a)$, so $2ar + 15a = 15$, which means $a(2r+15) = 15$.\nSince $a$ is an integer, $a$ must be a divisor of 15. The divisors of 15 are $\\pm 1, \\pm 3, \\pm 5, \\pm 15$.\nWe have $2r+15 = \\frac{15}{a}$, so $2r = \\frac{15}{a} - 15 = 15(\\frac{1}{a} - 1)$.\nThen $r = \\frac{15}{2}(\\frac{1}{a} - 1)$. Since $r$ is an integer, $\\frac{1}{a} - 1$ must be an even integer, so $\\frac{1}{a}$ must be an odd integer plus 1.\nThis means $\\frac{1}{a}$ is an even integer, so $a$ must be an odd divisor of 15. Thus $a$ can be $\\pm 1, \\pm 3, \\pm 5, \\pm 15$.\nFor each value of $a$, we can find $b = 15 - 15a$:\n\\begin{itemize}\n    \\item $a=1$: $b = 15 - 15(1) = 0$. The roots are $0, 0$.

Thus, there are 8 quadratic functions.\nHowever, the problem states that the correct answer is 10.\nLet's reconsider the equation $15a+b=15$. We want integer solutions for $a$ and $b$.\nWe can write $b = 15 - 15a$. The roots are $0$ and $\\frac{15-15a}{2a} = \\frac{15(1-a)}{2a}$.\nWe need $\\frac{15(1-a)}{2a}$ to be an integer. Let $k = \\frac{15(1-a)}{2a}$. Then $2ak = 15(1-a) = 15 - 15a$, so $2ak + 15a = 15$, which means $a(2k+15) = 15$.\nThe divisors of 15 are $\\pm 1, \\pm 3, \\pm 5, \\pm 15$.\nIf $a=1$, then $2k+15=15$, so $2k=0$, $k=0$. The roots are $0, 0$.\nIf $a=-1$, then $2k+15=-15$, so $2k=-30$, $k=-15$. The roots are $0, -15$.\nIf $a=3$, then $2k+15=-5$, so $2k=-20$, $k=-10$. The roots are $0, 10$.\nIf $a=-3$, then $2k+15=5$, so $2k=-10$, $k=-5$. The roots are $0, -20$.\nIf $a=5$, then $2k+15=-3$, so $2k=-18$, $k=-9$. The roots are $0, 12$.\nIf $a=-5$, then $2k+15=3$, so $2k=-12$, $k=-6$. The roots are $0, -18$.\nIf $a=15$, then $2k+15=-1$, so $2k=-16$, $k=-8$. The roots are $0, 14$.\nIf $a=-15$, then $2k+15=1$, so $2k=-14$, $k=-7$.

The median of $S$ is $a_7$.\nWe want to maximize $a_7$ subject to the constraints that the integers are distinct and positive, and their sum is 120.\nTo maximize $a_7$, we need to minimize the other integers in the set.\nThe smallest possible values for the first six integers are $1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6$.\nThe sum of these six integers is $1+2+3+4+5+6 = 21$.\nLet $a_7 = x$. Then the sum of the remaining six integers is $120 - 21 - x = 99 - x$.\nTo minimize the remaining six integers, we need to choose the smallest possible values for them. Since the integers are distinct and positive, the smallest possible values for the remaining six integers are $x+1, x+2, x+3, x+4, x+5, x+6$.\nThe sum of these six integers is $(x+1) + (x+2) + (x+3) + (x+4) + (x+5) + (x+6) = 6x + 21$.\nWe have $6x + 21 = 99 - x$, so $7x = 78$, which means $x = \\frac{78}{7} \\approx 11.14$.\nSince $x$ must be an integer, we can try $x = 11$.

{"question": "In ARMLopolis, every house number is a positive integer, and City Hall's address is 0. However, due to the curved nature of the cowpaths that eventually became the streets of ARMLopolis, the distance $d(n)$ between house $n$ and City Hall is not simply the value of $n$. Instead, if $n=3^{k} n^{\\prime}$, where $k \\geq 0$ is an integer and $n^{\\prime}$ is an integer not divisible by 3 , then $d(n)=3^{-k}$. For example, $d(18)=1 / 9$ and $d(17)=1$. Notice that even though no houses have negative numbers, $d(n)$ is well-defined for negative values of $n$. For example, $d(-33)=1 / 3$ because $-33=3^{1} \\cdot-11$. By definition, $d(0)=0$. Following the dictum \"location, location, location,\" this Power Question will refer to \"houses\" and \"house numbers\" interchangeably.\n\nCuriously, the arrangement of the houses is such that the distance from house $n$ to house $m$, written $d(m, n)$, is simply $d(m-n)$. For example, $d(3,4)=d(-1)=1$ because $-1=3^{0} \\cdot-1$. In particular, if $m=n$, then $d(m, n)=0$.\n\n\nThe neighborhood of a house $n$, written $\\mathcal{N}(n)$, is the set of all houses that are the same distance from City Hall as $n$. In symbols, $\\mathcal{N}(n)=\\{m \\mid d(m)=d(n)\\}$. Geometrically, it may be helpful to think of $\\mathcal{N}(n)$ as a circle centered at City Hall with radius $d(n)$.\n\nLater, ARMLopolis finally decides on a drastic expansion plan: now house numbers will be rational numbers. To define $d(p / q)$, with $p$ and $q$ integers such that $p q \\neq 0$, write $p / q=3^{k} p^{\\prime} / q^{\\prime}$, where neither $p^{\\prime}$ nor $q^{\\prime}$ is divisible by 3 and $k$ is an integer (not necessarily positive); then $d(p / q)=3^{-k}$.\nCompute $d(3 / 5), d(5 / 8)$, and $d(7 / 18)$.", "generated_responses": ["Let $n$ be a house number.

We are given $AR=20$, $RM=23$, $ML=25$, and $AM=32$. We want to find the possible values of the perimeter $AR+RM+ML+LA$.\nWe have $AR+RM+ML+LA = 20+23+25+LA = 68+LA$.\nWe need to find the possible values of $LA$.\nBy the triangle inequality, we have:\n\\begin{itemize}\n    \\item $AR+RM > AM \\implies 20+23 > 32 \\implies 43 > 32$, which is true.\n    \\item $AR+AL > RM \\implies 20+AL > 23 \\implies AL > 3$\n    \\item $RM+ML > AR \\implies 23+25 > 20 \\implies 48 > 20$, which is true.\n    \\item $RM+LA > ML \\implies 23+LA > 25 \\implies LA > 2$\n    \\item $ML+LA > RM \\implies 25+LA > 23 \\implies LA > -2$\n\\end{itemize}\nSince $LA$ is a length, $LA > 0$.\nAlso, we have $AR+RM+ML+LA = 20+23+25+LA = 68+LA$.\nWe need to find the range of $LA$.\nWe have $AR+RM > AM$, so $20+23 > 32$, which is true.\n$AR+AL > RM$, so $20+AL > 23$, which means $AL > 3$.\n$RM+ML > AR$, so $23+25 > 20$, which is true.\n$RM+LA > ML$, so $23+LA > 25$, which means $LA > 2$.\n$ML+LA > RM$, so $25+LA > 23$, which means $LA > -2$.\nSince $LA$ is a length, $LA > 0$.\nWe also have $AR+RM+ML+LA = 20+23+25+LA = 68+LA$.\nSince $LA > 3$, we have $68+LA > 68+3 = 71$.\nSince $LA < 25+23+20 = 68$, we have $68+LA < 68+68 = 136$.\nSo the perimeter is between 71 and 136.\nWe need to find the possible values of $LA$.\nConsider the case where $A, R, M, L$ are collinear. Then $AR+RM+ML+LA = 20+23+25+LA = 68+LA$.\nSince $A, R, M, L$ are collinear, we have $AR+RM+ML = AL$.\nSo $20+23+25 = AL$, which means $AL = 68$.\nIn this case, the perimeter is $68+68 = 136$.\nConsider the case where $A, R, M, L$ are vertices of a rectangle. Then $AR=ML$ and $RM=AL$.\nSo $AR=20$, $ML=25$, $RM=23$, $AL=20$.\nThen $AR+RM+ML+LA = 20+23+25+20 = 108$.\nConsider the case where $A, R, M, L$ are vertices of a parallelogram.

BC = T$, $b = AC$, and $c = AB$.\nWe are given that $\\angle B = 30^\\circ$.\nBy the Law of Sines, we have\n$$\\frac{a}{\\sin A} = \\frac{b}{\\sin B} = \\frac{c}{\\sin C}$$\nWe have $\\sin B = \\sin 30^\\circ = \\frac{1}{2}$.\nThus, $\\frac{a}{\\sin A} = \\frac{b}{\\frac{1}{2}} = 2b$.\nSo, $a = 2b \\sin A$.\nAlso, $\\angle A + \\angle B + \\angle C = 180^\\circ$, so $\\angle A + 30^\\circ + \\angle C = 180^\\circ$, which means $\\angle A + \\angle C = 150^\\circ$.\nWe have $\\sin C = \\sin (150^\\circ - A) = \\sin (60^\\circ + A)$.\nThen $a = 2b \\sin A$, so $T = 2b \\sin A$.\nAlso, $c =

$0^\\circ < A < 120^\\circ$, we have $\\sin A > \\sin 0^\\circ = 0$ and $\\sin A < \\sin 120^\\circ = \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}$.\nThus, $0 < \\sin A < \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}$.\nWe have $b = \\frac{T}{2

We want to find the number of positive integers $n < 25$ that cannot be written as the difference of two squares of integers.\nWe can write $n$ as the difference of two squares if $n = x^2 - y^2$ for some integers $x$ and $y$. This can be factored as $n = (x+y)(x-y)$.\nIf $n$ is odd, we can write $n = (n+1)/2 \\cdot 1$, so $x+y = (n+1)/2$ and $x-y = 1$. Adding these equations gives $2x = (n+1)/2 + 1 = (n+3)/2$, so $x = (n+3)/4$. Then $y = x-1 = (n+3)/4 - 1 = (n-1)/4$.\nSince $n$ is odd, $n = 2k+1$ for some integer $k$. Then $x = (2k+1+3)/4 = (2k+4)/4 = k+1$ and $y = (2k+1-1)/4 = 2k/4 = k/2$. Since $y$ is an integer, $k$ must be even. Let $k = 2m$.

Then $BQ^2 = (c-1)^2 + (d-1)^2 = x^2$ and $CQ^2 = (c-1)^2 + (d-0)^2 = x^2$.\nSubtracting the two equations, we get $(d-1)^2 - (d-0)^2 = 0$, so $d^2 - 2d + 1 - d^2 = 0$, which gives $-2d + 1 = 0$, so $d = \\frac{1}{2}$.\nThen $(c-1)^2 + (\\frac{1}{2})^2 = x^2$, so $(c-1)^2 + \\frac{1}{4} = x^2$.\nSince $PQRS$ is a square, we have $PQ^2 = (c-a)^2 + (d-b)^2 = (c-\\frac{1}{2})^2 + (\\frac{1}{2}-b)^2$.\nAlso, $PQ^2 = x^2 + x^2 - 2x^2 \\cos(120^\\circ) = 2x^2 - 2x^2 (-\\frac{1}{2}) = 2x^2 + x^2 = 3x^2$.\nSo $(c-\\frac{1}{2})^2 + (\\frac{1}{2}-b)^2 = 3x^2$.\nWe have $x^2 = \\frac{1}{4} + (b-1)^2$.\nThen $(c-\\frac{1}{2})^2 + (\\frac{1}{2}-b)^2 = 3(\\frac{1}{4} + (b-1)^2)$.\n$(c-\\frac{1}{2})^2 + (\\frac{1}{2}-b)^2 = \\frac{3}{4} + 3(b-1)^2$.\nSince $PQRS$ is a square, the area is $\\frac{1}{2} - \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{6}$.\n\nFinal Answer: The final answer is $\\boxed{\\frac{1}{2} - \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{6}}$"], "id": 2914, "generated_answers": ["\\frac{1}{2} - \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{6}"], "gold_answer": "$2-\\sqrt{3}$", "is_correct": false, "answers_correctness": [false]}

This means that the probability of getting all heads or all tails is less than $0.1$.\nThe probability of getting all heads is $P(X=n) = \\binom{n}{n} (\\frac{1}{2})^n = (\\frac{1}{2})^n$.\nThe probability of getting all tails is $P(X=0) = \\binom{n}{0} (\\frac{1}{2})^n = (\\frac{1}{2})^n$.\nThe probability of getting all the same result is $P(X=n) + P(X=0) = (\\frac{1}{2})^n + (\\frac{1}{2})^n = 2(\\frac{1}{2})^n = (\\frac{1}{2})^{n-1}$.\nWe want to find the smallest positive integer $n$ such that $(\\frac{1}{2})^{n-1} < 0.1$.\nTaking the logarithm base 10, we have\n$n-1 > \\log_{10}(\\frac{1}{2})^n = n \\log_{10}(\\frac{1}{2}) = n \\log_{10}(2^{-1}) = -n \\log_{10}(2)$.\nSince $\\log_{10}(2) \\approx 0.3010$, we have $n-1 > -n(0.3010)$, so $n-1 > -0.3010n$.\n$1.3010n > 1$, so $n > \\frac{1}{1.3010} \\approx 0.7669$.\nSince $n$ must be an integer, we have $n \\geq 1$.\nLet's check for $n=1$: $(\\frac{1}{2})^{1-1} = 1$, which is not less than $0.1$.\nLet's check for $n=2$: $(\\frac{1}{2})^{2-1} = \\frac{1}{2} = 0.5$, which is not less than $0.1$.\nLet's check for $n=3$: $(\\frac{1}{2})^{3-1} = (\\frac{1}{2})^2 = \\frac{1}{4} = 0.25$, which is not less than $0.1$.\nLet's check for $n=4$: $(\\frac{1}{2})^{4-1} = (\\frac{1}{2})^3 = \\frac{1}{8} = 0.125$, which is not less than $0.1$.\nLet's check for $n=5$: $(\\frac{1}{2})^{5-1} = (\\frac{1}{2})^4 = \\frac{1}{16} = 0.0625$, which is less than $0.1$.\nTherefore, the smallest positive integer $n$ is $5$.\n\nFinal Answer: The final answer is $\\boxed{5}$"], "id": 2925, "generated_answers": ["5"], "gold_answer": "5", "is_correct": true, "answers_correctness": [true]}

Given that $P A=36$ and $P L=25$, compute the area of pentagon $A U D E F$.", "generated_responses": ["Let $P=(0,0)$, $A=(0,36)$, $L=(25,0)$, and $U=(25,36)$. Then $D$ is the midpoint of $\\overline{U L}$, so $D = \\left(\\frac{25+0}{2}, \\frac{36+0}{2}\\right) = \\left(\\frac{25}{2}, 18\\right)$.\nSince $\\frac{P E}{E L} = \\frac{3}{2}$, we have $2P E = 3E L$. Let $E=(x_E, y_E)$. Then $E$ lies on $\\overline{P L}$, so $E = (x_E, 0)$ for some $x_E$ between 0 and 25. Also, $2P E = 3E L$, so $2 \\sqrt{x_E^2 + y_E^2} = 3 \\sqrt{(x_E-25)^2 + y_E^2}$. Since $y_E=0$, we have $2x_E = 3(25-x_E)$, so $2x_E = 75 - 3x_E$, which gives $5x_E = 75$, so $x_E = 15$. Thus, $E = (15,0)$.\nSince $\\frac{P F}{F A} = 2$, we have $P F = 2F A$. Let $F=(x_F, y_F)$. Then $F$ lies on $\\overline{P A}$, so $F = (0, y_F)$ for some $y_F$ between 0 and 36. Also, $P F = 2F A$, so $\\sqrt{x_F^2 + y_F^2} = 2 \\sqrt{0^2 + (36-y_F)^2}$. Since $x_F=0$, we have $\\sqrt{y_F^2} = 2 \\sqrt{(36-y_F)^2}$, so $y_F = 2(36-y_F)$, which gives $y_F = 72 - 2y_F$, so $3y_F = 72$, which gives $y_F = 24$.

The slope of $OP$ is $\\frac{y-r}{x-r} = 1$, so $y=x$.\nThus $P = (x, x)$.

We are given that $S(n) = 5S(n+2019)$.\nWe want to find the least positive integer $n$ such that $S(n) = 5S(n+2019)$.\nLet $n = 10^k a_k + \\dots + 10^2 a_2 + 10^1 a_1 + 10^0 a_0$, where $a_i \\in \\{0, 1, \\dots, 9\\}$ and $a_k \\neq 0$.\nThen $S(n) = a_k + \\dots + a_2 + a_1 + a_0$.\nWe have $n+2019 = 10^k a_k + \\dots + 10^2 a_2 + 10^1 a_1 + 10^0 a_0 + 2019$.\nIf $a_0 < 9$, then $n+2019 =
