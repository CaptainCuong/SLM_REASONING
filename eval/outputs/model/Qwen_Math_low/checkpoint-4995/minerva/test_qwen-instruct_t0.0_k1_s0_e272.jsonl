{"question": "Take the total energy (potential plus thermal) of the Sun to be given by the simple expression:\n\\[\nE \\simeq-\\frac{G M^{2}}{R}\n\\]\nwhere $M$ and $R$ are the mass and radius, respectively.

Assume that the total energy of the Sun is always given by the above expression, even as $R$ gets smaller. By writing down a simple (differential) equation relating the power radiated at Sun's surface with the change in its total energy (using the above expression), integrate this equation to find the time (in years) for the Sun to shrink to $1 / 2$ its present radius.

{"question": "A Boolean function $F(A, B)$ is said to be universal if any arbitrary boolean function can be constructed by using nested $F(A, B)$ functions. A universal function is useful, since using it we can build any function we wish out of a single part. For example, when implementing boolean logic on a computer chip a universal function (called a 'gate' in logic-speak) can simplify design enormously. We would like to find a universal boolean function. In this problem we will denote the two boolean inputs $A$ and $B$ and the one boolean output as $C$. \nFirst, to help us organize our thoughts, let's enumerate all of the functions we'd like to be able to construct. How many different possible one-output boolean functions of two variables are there?

{"question": "Whiskey, suspected to be of the \"moonshine\" variety, is analyzed for its age by determining its amount of naturally occurring tritium (T) which is a radioactive hydrogen isotope $\\left({ }^{3} \\mathrm{H}\\right)$ with a half-life of $12.5$ years. In this \"shine\" the activity is found to be $6 \\%$ of that encountered in fresh bourbon. What is the age (in years) of the whiskey in question?", "generated_responses": ["Let $A_0$ be the initial amount of tritium in the fresh bourbon, and $A_t$ be the amount of tritium in the whiskey after $t$ years. The half-life of tritium is $12.5$ years, so the amount of tritium remaining after $t$ years is given by the formula\n$$A_t = A_0 \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^{\\frac{t}{12.5}}$$\nThe activity of tritium is proportional to the amount of tritium, so the activity of tritium in the whiskey is $A_t$, and the activity of tritium in the fresh bourbon is $A_0$. We are given that the activity of tritium in the whiskey is $6\\%$ of that in the fresh bourbon, which means $A_t = 0.06 A_0$.\nSubstituting this into the formula for $A_t$, we have\n$$0.06 A_0 = A_0 \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^{\\frac{t}{12.5}}$$\nSince $A_0 \\neq 0$, we can divide both sides by $A_0$ to get\n$$0.06 = \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^{\\frac{t}{12.5}}$$\nTaking the natural logarithm of both sides, we have\n$$\\ln(0.06) = \\ln\\left(\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^{\\frac{t}{12.5}}\\right)$$\n$$\\ln(0.06) = \\frac{t}{12.5} \\ln\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)$$\nSince $\\ln\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right) = \\ln(1) - \\ln(2) = -\\ln(2)$, we have\n$$\\ln(0.06) = \\frac{t}{12.5} (-\\ln(2))$$\n$$t = \\frac{12.5 \\ln(0.06)}{-\\ln(2)}$$\nUsing a calculator, we find that $\\ln(0.06) \\approx -2.807$ and $\\ln(2) \\approx 0.693$. Therefore,\n$$t = \\frac{12.5(-2.807)}{-0.693} \\approx \\frac{-35.0875}{-0.693} \\approx 50.6$$\nThe age of the whiskey is approximately $50.6$ years.\n\nFinal Answer: The final answer is $\\boxed{50.6}$"], "generated_answers": ["50.6"], "gold_answer": "50.7", "is_correct": false, "answers_correctness": [false]}
