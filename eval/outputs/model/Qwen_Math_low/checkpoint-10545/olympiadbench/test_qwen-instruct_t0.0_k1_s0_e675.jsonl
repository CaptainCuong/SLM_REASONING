Then we want to find $AB$.\nWe have $A = 2015^3 + b(2015^2) + c(2015) + d$ and $B = 2016^3 + b(2016^2) + c(2016) + d$.\nWe can write $A = 2015^3 + b(2015^2) + c(2015) + d$ and $B = 2016^3 + b(2016^2) + c(2016) + d$.\nWe have $2016 = 2015 + 1$, so $2016^3 = (2015+1)^3 = 2015^3 + 3(2015^2) + 3(2015) + 1$.\n$2016^2 = (2015+1)^2 = 2015^2 + 2(2015) + 1$.\n$2016 = 2015 + 1$.\nThen $B = (2015^3 + 3(2015^2) + 3(2015) + 1) + b(2015^2 + 2(2015) + 1) + c(2015+1) + d = (2015^3 + b(2015^2) + c(2015) + d) + 3(2015^2) + 3(2015) + 1 + b(2(2015)) + b + c + 2c + d = A + 3(2015^2) + 3(2015) + 1 + 2b(2015) + b + 3c + d$.\n$B = A + 3(2015^2) + 3(2015) + 1 + 2b(2015) + b + 3c + d$.\n$B = A + 3(2015^2 + 2015) + 1 + b(2(2015)+1) + 3c$.\n$B = A + 3(2015)(2016) + 1 + b(4031) + 3c$.\n$A \\cdot B = A(A + 3(2015)(2016) + 1 + b(4031) + 3c) = A^2 + A(3(2015)(2016) + 1 + b(4031) + 3c)$.\nIf $a_n = n^3$, then $a_{2015} = 2015^3$ and $a_{2016} = 2016^3$.\nThen $a_{2015} \\cdot a_{2016} = 2015^3 \\cdot 2016^3 = (2015 \\cdot 2016)^3 = (2015 \\cdot (2015+1))^3 = (2015^2 + 2015)^3$.\nIf $a_n = n^3 + n$, then $a_{2015} = 2015^3 + 2015$ and $a_{2016} = 2016^3 + 2016$.\nThen $a_{2015} \\cdot a_{2016} = (2015^3 + 2015)(2016^3 + 2016) = 2015(2015^2+1) \\cdot 2016(2016^2+1)$.\nIf $a_n = n^3 + bn^2 + cn + d$, then $a_0 = d$, $a_1 = 1+b+c+d$, $a_2 = 8+4b+2c+d$.\nWe have $a_1 - a_0 = b+c+1$ and $a_2 - a_1 = 7+3b+c$.\nSince $a_n$ is an integer for all $n$, we must have $b+c+1$ and $7+3b+c$ be integers.\nLet $b=0$ and $c=0$.

Then $d_1 = 1$, $d_2 = p^2 - 1$.\nWe need $1 + p^2 - 1 = p^2$ to be a perfect square, which is $p^2 = k^2$ for some integer $k$.\nThen $p=k$, so $p^2 = p^2$.\nWe have $d_1 = 1$, $d_2 = p^2 - 1$.\nWe need $d_1 d_2 = 1 \\cdot (p^2 - 1) = p^2 - 1$ to be a perfect square.\nSo $p^2 - 1 = l^2$ for some integer $l$.\nThen $p^2 - l^2 = 1$, so $(p-l)(p+l) = 1$.\nSince $p, l$ are integers, we must have $p-l = 1$ and $p+l = 1$, which gives $2p=2$, so $p=1$.\nThen $d_1 = 1$, $d_2 = 0$, which is not a divisor.\nLet $a=2$. Then $d_1 = 4$, $d_2 = p^2 - 4$.\nWe need $4 + p^2 - 4 = p^2$ to be a perfect square.\nLet $p=3$. Then $d_1 = 4$, $d_2 = 9-4 = 5$.\n$d_1+d_2 = 4+5 = 9 = 3^2$.\n$d_1 d_2 = 4 \\cdot 5 = 20$, which is not a perfect square.\nLet $p=5$. Then $d_1 = 4$, $d_2 = 25-4 = 21$.\n$d_1+d_2 = 4+21 = 25 = 5^2$.\n$d_1 d_2 = 4 \\cdot 21 = 84$, which is not a perfect square.\nIf $n = 1$, then the only divisor is $1$, so $d_1 = 1$.\nIf $n = 4$, then the divisors are $1, 2, 4$. We have $d_1 = 1, d_2 = 3, d_3 = 4$.\n$1, 1+3=4, 1+3+4=8$ are not perfect squares.\nIf $n = 9$, then the divisors are $1, 3, 9$. We have $d_1 = 1, d_2 = 2, d_3 = 3$.\n$1, 1+2=3, 1+2+3=6$ are not perfect squares.\nIf $n = 16$, then the divisors are $1, 2, 4, 8, 16$. We have $d_1 = 1, d_2 = 3, d_3 = 5, d_4 = 7, d_5 = 9, d_6 = 11, d_7 = 13, d_8 = 15, d_9 = 16$.\n$1, 1+3=4, 1+3+5=9, 1+3+5+7=16, 1+3+5+7+9=25, 1+3+5+7+9+11=36, 1+3+5+7+9+11+13=49, 1+3+5+7+9+11+13+15=64, 1+3+5+7+9+11+13+15+16=81$.\nSo $n=16$ works.\n\nFinal Answer: The final answer is $\\boxed{16}$"], "id": 1800, "generated_answers": ["16"], "gold_answer": "1,3", "is_correct": false, "answers_correctness": [false]}

We are given that we can put these divisors into the cells of a rectangular table such that each cell contains a distinct divisor, the sums of all rows are equal, and the sums of all columns are equal.\n\nLet $r$ be the number of rows and $c$ be the number of columns. Then $r \\times c = k$, the number of divisors of $n$. Let $S$ be the sum of the divisors in each row and each column. Then $rS = \\sum_{i=1}^k d_i = cS$. Thus, $r = c$. Since $r \\times c = k$, we have $r^2 = k$. So $k$ must be a perfect square.\nLet $r = c = m$. Then the sum of the divisors in each row is $S$, and the sum of the divisors in each column is $S$. Thus, the sum of all divisors is $mS$.\nAlso, the sum of the divisors of $n$ is $\\sigma(n)$. Thus, $mS = \\sigma(n)$.\nSince $S$ is the sum of the divisors in a row, $S \\le \\sigma(n)$.\nSince $mS = \\sigma(n)$, we must have $m \\le 1$. But $m$ is the number of rows, so $m \\ge 1$. Thus, $m=1$.\nThen $r=c=1$, so there is only one row and one column. This means that $n$ has only one divisor, which is $n$ itself. But $n$ is a positive integer, so $n \\ge 1$. Thus, $n$ must be 1.\nHowever, the divisors of $n$ are $1, 2, \\dots, n$. So $k = n$.\nIf $n=1$, then the only divisor is 1. We can put 1 in a $1 \\times 1$ table.

So $S = \\frac{p^{k+1}-1}{p-1}$. Also, $r \\times c = (k+1)$, so $r = c = k+1$.\nThen $mS = \\sigma(n) = \\frac{p^{k+1}-1}{p-1}$. So $(k+1)S = \\frac{p^{k+1}-1}{p-1}$.\nWe need $r=c=k+1$. Then $S = \\frac{p^{k+1}-1}{(k+1)(p-1)}$.\nFor $k=1$, $n=p$, and $S = \\frac{p^2-1}{2(p-1)} = \\frac{(p-1)(p+1)}{2(p-1)} = \\frac{p+1}{2}$. Then $r=c=2$. The divisors are 1 and $p$.

We have $W_A + L_A + W_B + L_B = 2 + 15 + 7 + 9 = 33$.\nSince each team plays 20 games, we have $W_A + L_A + T_A = 20$ and $W_B + L_B + T_B = 20$.\nFor team A, we have $2 + 15 + 3 = 20$.\nFor team B, we have $7 + 9 + 4 = 20$.\nFor team C, we have $6 + 12 + 2 = 20$.\nFor team D, we have $10 + 8 + 2 = 20$.\nFor team E, we have $x + y + z = 20$.\nWe have $W_A + W_B + W_C + W_D + W_E = 2 + 7 + 6 + 10 + x = 25 + x$.\nWe have $L_A + L_B + L_C + L_D + L_E = 15 + 9 + 12 + 8 + y = 44 + y$.\nWe have $T_A + T_B + T_C + T_D + T_E = 3 + 4 + 2 + 2 + z = 11 + z$.\nWe know that $x + y + z = 20$.\nAlso, $25 + x = 44 + y = 11 + z$.\nFrom $25 + x = 44 + y$, we have $x -

Let the height of the triangle be $h$. Since the triangle is a right triangle, we have $h^2 + 9^2 = 15^2$, so $h^2 + 81 = 225$, which means $h^2 = 144$, so $h=12$.\nLet the distance from the vertex of the right angle to the center of the sphere be $d$. Since the sphere is tangent to the three sides of the triangle, the distance from the center of the sphere to each side is equal to the radius of the sphere, which is 5.\nLet the coordinates of the vertices of the triangle be $A=(0,0)$, $B=(9,0)$, and $C=(0,12)$. Then the hypotenuse is the line segment $BC$, which has equation $\\frac{x}{9} + \\frac{y}{12} = 1$, or $12x + 9y = 108$.\nThe center of the sphere is at $(x_0, y_0, z_0)$.

{"question": "The numbers $a, b, c$, in that order, form a three term arithmetic sequence (see below) and $a+b+c=60$.\n\nThe numbers $a-2, b, c+3$, in that order, form a three term geometric sequence.

For example, $3,5,7$ is an arithmetic sequence with three terms.\n\nA geometric sequence is a sequence in which each term after the first is obtained from the previous term by multiplying it by a constant. For example, $3,6,12$ is a geometric sequence with three terms.)\n\nPresent your answer in the form of coordinates (e.g. (1, 2, 3) for a=1, b=2, c=3).", "generated_responses": ["}\nLet the arithmetic sequence be $a, b, c$. Then $b = a+d$ and $c = a+2d$ for some common difference $d$. Since $a+b+c=60$, we have $a + (a+d) + (a+2d) = 60$, which simplifies to $3a+3d = 60$, or $a+d = 20$. Thus, $b = 20$.\nThe geometric sequence is $a-2, b, c+3$. Since $b=20$, the geometric sequence is $a-2, 20, c+3$. The ratio between the second and first term is $\\frac{20}{a-2}$, and the ratio between the third and second term is $\\frac{c+3}{20}$. Since the sequence is geometric, we have $\\frac{20}{a-2} = \\frac{c+3}{20}$. Thus, $20^2 = (a-2)(c+3)$, so $400 = (a-2)(a+2d+3)$. Since $b = a+d = 20$, we have $d = 20-a$. Substituting this into the equation above, we get\n$400 = (a-2)(a+2(20-a)+3) = (a-2)(a+40-2a+3) = (a-2)(43-a) = 43a - a^2 - 86 + 2a = -a^2 + 45a - 86$.\nThus, $a^2 - 45a + 86 = 0$. We can factor this quadratic as $(a-2)(a-43) = 0$. So $a=2$ or $a=43$.\nIf $a=2$, then $d = 20-2 = 18$. Then $b=20$ and $c = a+2d = 2+2(18) = 2+36 = 38$.\nIf $a=43$, then $d = 20-43 = -23$. Then $b=20$ and $c = a+2d = 43+2(-23) = 43-46 = -3$.\nWe check that $a, b, c$ form an arithmetic sequence, and $a+b+c=60$.\nIf $a=2, b=20, c=38$, then $2, 20, 38$ is an arithmetic sequence with $a=2, b=20, c=38$. Also, $2+20+38 = 60$.\nIf $a=43, b=20, c=-3$, then $43, 20, -3$ is an arithmetic sequence with $a=43, b=20, c=-3$. Also, $43+20+(-3) = 60$.\nNow we check that $a-2, b, c+3$ form a geometric sequence.\nIf $a=2, b=20, c=38$, then $a-2=0, b=20, c+3=41$. The ratio is $\\frac{20}{0}$, which is undefined.\nIf $a=43, b=20, c=-3$, then $a-2=41, b=20, c+3=0$. The ratio is $\\frac{20}{41}$.\nWe have $a-2, b, c+3$ form a geometric sequence, so $\\frac{b}{a-2} = \\frac{c+3}{b}$.\nIf $a=2, b=20, c=38$, then $\\frac{20}{2-2}$ is undefined, so this is not a geometric sequence.\nIf $a=43, b=20, c=-3$, then $\\frac{20}{43-2} = \\frac{20}{41}$ and $\\frac{-3+3}{20} = \\frac{0}{20} = 0$. Since $\\frac{20}{41} \\neq 0$, this is not a geometric sequence.\nHowever, we are given that $a, b, c$ are in arithmetic progression, so $b-a = c-b$, which means $2b = a+c$. Since $a+b+c=60$, we have $b = 20$.\nAlso, $a-2, b, c+3$ are in geometric progression, so $b^2 = (a-2)(c+3)$. Since $b=20$, we have $20^2 = (a-2)(c+3)$, so $400 = (a-2)(c+3)$.\nSince $2b = a+c$, we have $2(20) = a+c$, so $a+c = 40$.\nNow we have a system of two equations with two variables:\n$a+c = 40$\n$(a-2)(c+3) = 400$\nFrom the first equation, $c = 40-a$. Substituting into the second equation, we get\n$(a-2)(40-a+3) = 400$\n$(a-2)(43-a) = 400$\n$43a - a^2 - 86 + 2a = 400$\n$-a^2 + 45a - 86 - 400 = 0$\n$-a^2 + 45a - 486 = 0$\n$a^2 - 45a + 486 = 0$\nWe can factor this quadratic as $(a-18)(a-27) = 0$. So $a=18$ or $a=27$.\nIf $a=18$, then $c = 40-18 = 22$. Then $a-2=16, b=20, c+3=25$. The ratio is $\\frac{20}{16} = \\frac{5}{4}$ and $\\frac{25}{20} = \\frac{5}{4}$. So this is a geometric sequence.\nIf $a=27$, then $c = 40-27 = 13$. Then $a-2=25, b=20, c+3=16$. The ratio is $\\frac{20}{25} = \\frac{4}{5}$ and $\\frac{16}{20} = \\frac{4}{5}$. So this is a geometric sequence.\nIf $a=18, b=20, c=22$, then $18, 20, 22$ is an arithmetic sequence.

Thus, we have\n$$ \\binom{d}{2} = n $$\n$$ \\frac{d(d-1)}{2} = n $$\n$$ d(d-1) = 2n $$\n$$ d^2 - d - 2n = 0 $$\nWe want to find $d$ in terms of $n$. Using the quadratic formula,\n$$ d = \\frac{-(-1) \\pm \\sqrt{(-1)^2 - 4(1)(-2n)}}{2(1)} = \\frac{1 \\pm \\sqrt{1 + 8n}}{2} $$\nSince $d$ must be a positive integer, we take the positive root:\n$$ d = \\frac{1 + \\sqrt{1 + 8n}}{2} $$\nHowever, we need to ensure that $d$ is an integer. Since $d(d-1) = 2n$, $d$ and $d-1$ are integers, so $2n$ must be an integer. Also, $1+8n$ must be a perfect square, say $k^2$, where $k$ is an integer. Then $1+8n = k^2$, so $8n = k^2 - 1 = (k-1)(k+1)$. Thus, $n = \\frac{(k-1)(k+1)}{8}$.\nSince $n$ is the number of residents, $n$ must be a positive integer. Therefore, $k$ must be odd. Let $k = 2m+1$ for some integer $m$. Then $n = \\frac{(2m)(2m+2)}{8} = \\frac{4m(m+1)}{8} = \\frac{m(m+1)}{2}$.\nSo $n$ is the number of residents, and $d$ is the number of dishes.\nWe have $d(d-1) = 2n$, so $d^2 - d - 2n = 0$.\nWe want to find $d$ in terms of $n$.\n$$ d = \\frac{1 \\pm \\sqrt{1+8n}}{2} $$\nSince $d$ must be a positive integer, we have $d = \\frac{1+\\sqrt{1+8n}}{2}$.\nWe need $1+8n$ to be a perfect square. Let $1+8n = k^2$ for some integer $k$. Then $8n = k^2 - 1 = (k-1)(k+1)$.\nSo $n = \\frac{(k-1)(k+1)}{8}$. Since $n$ is an integer, $k$ must be odd. Let $k = 2m+1$ for some integer $m$.\nThen $n = \\frac{(2m)(2m+2)}{8} = \\frac{4m(m+1)}{8} = \\frac{m(m+1)}{2}$.\nSo $n$ is the number of residents. We have $d = \\frac{1+\\sqrt{1+8n}}{2}$.\nSince $n = \\frac{m(m+1)}{2}$, we have $1+8n = 1+8\\left(\\frac{m(m+1)}{2}\\right) = 1+4m(m+1) = 1+4m^2+4m$.\nWe want $d$ to be an integer. So $1+8n$ must be a perfect square.\nLet $1+8n = k^2$. Then $8n = k^2-1 = (k-1)(k+1)$.\nSo $n = \\frac{(k-1)(k+1)}{8}$. Since $n$ is an integer, $k$ must be odd.\nLet $k=3$. Then $n = \\frac{(3-1)(3+1)}{8} = \\frac{2(4)}{8} = 1$. Then $d = \\frac{1+\\sqrt{1+8(1)}}{2} = \\frac{1+\\sqrt{9}}{2} = \\frac{1+3}{2} = 2$.\nLet $k=5$. Then $n = \\frac{(5-1)(5+1)}{8} = \\frac{4(6)}{8} = 3$. Then $d = \\frac{1+\\sqrt{1+8(3)}}{2} = \\frac{1+\\sqrt{25}}{2} = \\frac{1+5}{2} = 3$.\nLet $k=7$. Then $n = \\frac{(7-1)(7+1)}{8} = \\frac{6(8)}{8} = 6$. Then $d = \\frac{1+\\sqrt{1+8(6)}}{2} = \\frac{1+\\sqrt{49}}{2} = \\frac{1+7}{2} = 4$.\nLet $k=9$.

{"question": "In ARMLopolis, every house number is a positive integer, and City Hall's address is 0. However, due to the curved nature of the cowpaths that eventually became the streets of ARMLopolis, the distance $d(n)$ between house $n$ and City Hall is not simply the value of $n$. Instead, if $n=3^{k} n^{\\prime}$, where $k \\geq 0$ is an integer and $n^{\\prime}$ is an integer not divisible by 3 , then $d(n)=3^{-k}$. For example, $d(18)=1 / 9$ and $d(17)=1$. Notice that even though no houses have negative numbers, $d(n)$ is well-defined for negative values of $n$. For example, $d(-33)=1 / 3$ because $-33=3^{1} \\cdot-11$. By definition, $d(0)=0$. Following the dictum \"location, location, location,\" this Power Question will refer to \"houses\" and \"house numbers\" interchangeably.\n\nCuriously, the arrangement of the houses is such that the distance from house $n$ to house $m$, written $d(m, n)$, is simply $d(m-n)$. For example, $d(3,4)=d(-1)=1$ because $-1=3^{0} \\cdot-1$. In particular, if $m=n$, then $d(m, n)=0$.\n\n\nThe neighborhood of a house $n$, written $\\mathcal{N}(n)$, is the set of all houses that are the same distance from City Hall as $n$.

However, eighteen families arrive and are looking to move in. After much debate, the connotations of using negative house numbers are deemed unacceptable, and the city decides on an alternative plan. On July 17, Shewad Movers arrive and relocate every family from house $n$ to house $n+18$, for all positive $n$ (so that City Hall does not move). For example, the family in house number 17 moves to house number 35.\nRoss takes a walk starting at his house, which is number 34 . He first visits house $n_{1}$, such that $d\\left(n_{1}, 34\\right)=1 / 3$. He then goes to another house, $n_{2}$, such that $d\\left(n_{1}, n_{2}\\right)=1 / 3$. Continuing in that way, he visits houses $n_{3}, n_{4}, \\ldots$, and each time, $d\\left(n_{i}, n_{i+1}\\right)=1 / 3$.

Let $P$ be a point outside the circle such that the shortest distance from $P$ to the circle is 4. This means that the distance from $P$ to the center $O$ is $d(P,O) = r+4 = 6+4 = 10$.\nLet $A$ and $B$ be points on the circle such that $AB$ is parallel to $OP$. Let $M$ be the midpoint of $AB$. Then $OM \\perp AB$. The distance between $AB$ and $OP$ is 2, so $OM = 2$.\nSince $M$ is the midpoint of $AB$, $AM = MB$. Also, $OM \\perp AB$, so $\\triangle OMA$ is a right triangle with $OM = 2$ and $OA = 6$. By the Pythagorean theorem, $AM^2 = OA^2 - OM^2 = 6^2 - 2^2 = 36 - 4 = 32$. Thus, $AM = \\sqrt{32} = 4\\sqrt{2}$.\nSince $AB$ is parallel to $OP$, we have $\\angle OAB = \\angle OBA$. Also, since $OM \\perp AB$, we have $OM \\perp OP$.\nLet $P$ be at coordinates $(x,y)$. Then $O$ is at $(0,0)$, and $P$ is at $(x,y)$ such that $x^2+y^2 = 10^2 = 100$.\nSince $AB$ is parallel to $OP$, the slope of $AB$ is the same as the slope of $OP$.\nThe slope of $OP$ is $\\frac{y}{x}$. The equation of line $AB$ is $y-0 = \\frac{y}{x}(x-0)$, so $y = \\frac{y}{x}x$.\nThe distance from $O$ to the line $AB$ is 2. The equation of the line $AB$ is $y = \\frac{y}{x}x$, which can be written as $y = \\frac{y}{x}x + 0$.\nThe distance from a point $(x_0, y_0)$ to a line $Ax+By+C=0$ is given by $\\frac{|Ax_0+By_0+C|}{\\sqrt{A^2+B^2}}$. In our case, the distance from $(0,0)$ to the line $y = \\frac{y}{x}x$ is 2.\nThe line $AB$ is $y = \\frac{y}{x}x$, so $y = \\frac{y}{x}x + 0$. The distance from $(0,0)$ to this line is 2.\nLet $A = (x_1, y_1)$ and $B = (x_2, y_2)$. Since $A$ and $B$ are on the circle, $x_1^2+y_1^2 = 36$ and $x_2^2+y_2^2 = 36$.\nSince $AB$ is parallel to $OP$, we have $\\frac{y_1-y_2}{x_1-x_2} = \\frac{y}{x}$.\nAlso, $OM = 2$, so $M = (0,2)$.\nSince $M$ is the midpoint of $AB$, $M = \\left(\\frac{x_1+x_2}{2}, \\frac{y_1+y_2}{2}\\right) = (0,2)$.\nThus, $x_1+x_2 = 0$ and $y_1+y_2 = 4$.\nAlso, $AB$ is parallel to $OP$, so $AB$ is a horizontal line. Then $y_1 = y_2$.\nSince $y_1+y_2 = 4$, we have $2y_1 = 4$, so $y_1 = y_2 = 2$.\nThen $x_1^2+2^2 = 36$, so $x_1^2 = 32$, and $x_1 = \\pm 4\\sqrt{2}$.\nSimilarly, $x_2^2+2^2 = 36$, so $x_2^2 = 32$, and $x_2 = \\pm 4\\sqrt{2}$.\nSince $x_1+x_2 = 0$, we have $x_1 = -x_2$. Thus, $A = (4\\sqrt{2}, 2)$ and $B = (-4\\sqrt{2}, 2)$.\nThen $PA^2 = (4\\sqrt{2}-x)^2 + (2-y)^2$ and $PB^2 = (-4\\sqrt{2}-x)^2 + (2-y)^2$.\n$PA^2+PB^2 = (4\\sqrt{2}-x)^2 + (2-y)^2 + (-4\\sqrt{2}-x)^2 + (2-y)^2 = 2(4\\sqrt{2}-x)^2 + 2(2-y)^2 = 2(32-8\\sqrt{2}x+x^2) + 2(4-4y+y^2) = 64-16\\sqrt{2}x+2x^2+8-8y+2y^2 = 72-16\\sqrt{2}x+2x^2-8y+2y^2$.\nSince $x^2+y^2 = 100$, we have $x^2 = 100-y^2$.\n$PA^2+PB^2 = 72-16\\sqrt{2}x+2(100-y^2)-8y+2y^2 = 72-16\\sqrt{2}x+200-2y^2-8y+2y^2 = 272-16\\sqrt{2}x-8y$.\nSince $AB$ is parallel to $OP$, the slope of $AB$ is $\\frac{y}{x}$. The slope of $AB$ is $\\frac{2-2}{4\\sqrt{2}-(-4\\sqrt{2})} = 0$. Thus, $y=0$.\nThen $x^2 = 100$, so $x = \\pm 10$.\n$PA^2+PB^2 = 272-16\\sqrt{2}(\\pm 10)-8(0) = 272 \\mp 160\\sqrt{2}$.\nWe are given that $PA^2+PB^2$ is a constant.\nLet $A = (x_1, y_1)$ and $B = (x_2, y_2)$.

Then $12 = \\frac{2K'}{a'+b'+c'}$, where $K'$ is the area of $\\triangle APQ$.\nSince $\\triangle APQ \\sim \\triangle ABC$, we have $\\frac{a'}{a} = \\frac{b'}{b} = \\frac{c'}{c} = k$.\nThen $a' = ka, b' = kb, c' = kc$.\nThe height of $\\triangle APQ$ is $h-24$.\nThe area of $\\triangle APQ$ is $K' = \\frac{1}{2} \\cdot PQ \\cdot (h-24) = \\frac{1}{2} \\cdot 24 \\cdot (h-24) = 12(h-24)$.\nThen $12 = \\frac{2 \\cdot 12(h-24)}{ka+kb+kc} = \\frac{24(h-24)}{k(a+b+c)}$.\nThus, $12k(a+b+c) = 24(h-24)$, so $k(a+b+c) = 2(h-24)$.\nSince $10(a+b+c) = ch$, we have $k(a+b+c) = \\frac{2}{10} ch = \\frac{1}{5} ch$.\nSo $\\frac{1}{5} ch = 2(h-24)$, which means $ch = 10(h-24)$.\nThen $ch = 10h - 240$, so $h(c-10) = -240$, which means $h = \\frac{240}{10-c}$.\nSince $h>0$, we must have $10-c>0$, so $c<10$.\nSince $PQ$ is parallel to $AB$, we have $\\triangle APQ \\sim \\triangle ABC$.\nThen $\\frac{PQ}{AB} = \\frac{h-24}{h}$, so $\\frac{24}{c} = \\frac{h-24}{h}$.\nThus, $24h = c(h-24) = ch-24c$, so $24h+24c = ch$, which means $24(h+c) = ch$.\nThen $24h+24c = ch$, so $24h = ch-24c$, which means $24h = c(h-24)$.\nThus, $c = \\frac{24h}{h-24}$.\nSince $h = \\frac{240}{10-c}$, we have $h = \\frac{240}{10-\\frac{24h}{h-24}} = \\frac{240(h-24)}{10(h-24)-24h} = \\frac{240(h-24)}{10h-240-24h} = \\frac{240(h-24)}{-14h-240}$.\nThen $h(-14h-240) = 240(h-24)$, so $-14h^2-240h = 240h-5760$, which means $14h^2+480h-5760 = 0$.\nDividing by 2, we get $7h^2+240h-2880 = 0$.\nUsing the quadratic formula, $h = \\frac{-240 \\pm \\sqrt{240^2-4(7)(-2880)}}{2(7)} = \\frac{-240 \\pm \\sqrt{57600+80640}}{14} = \\frac{-240 \\pm \\sqrt{138240}}{14} = \\frac{-240 \\pm 372}{14}$.\nSince $h>0$, we have $h = \\frac{-240+372}{14} = \\frac{132}{14} = \\frac{66}{7}$.\nThen $c = \\frac{24h}{h-24} = \\frac{24 \\cdot \\frac{66}{7}}{\\frac{66}{7}-24} = \\frac{24 \\cdot \\frac{66}{7}}{\\frac{66-168}{7}} = \\frac{24 \\cdot \\frac{66}{7}}{\\frac{-102}{7}} = \\frac{24 \\cdot 66}{-102} = \\frac{24 \\cdot 11}{-17} = -\\frac{264}{17}$, which is impossible.\nLet $r_A, r_C, r_B, r_D$ be the inradii of triangles $AXP, CXS, BYQ, CYR$ respectively.\nWe know that $r_A = \\frac{A(\\triangle AXP)}{s_A}$, where $s_A$ is the semiperimeter of $\\triangle AXP$.\nWe have $r_A = \\frac{1}{2} s_A - \\frac{A(\\triangle AXP)}{s_A}$.\nWe are given that $r=10$ and the area of square $PQRS$ is 576.\nThe inradius of $\\triangle ABC$ is 10.\nThe area of $\\triangle ABC$ is $K = \\frac{1}{2} c h$.\nThe semiperimeter of $\\triangle ABC$ is $s = \\frac{a+b+c}{2}$.\nThen $10 = \\frac{K}{s} = \\frac{\\frac{1}{2} c h}{\\frac{a+b+c}{2}} = \\frac{ch}{a+b+c}$.\nSo $10(a+b+c) = ch$, which means $10a+10b+10c = ch$.\nSince $PQ$ is parallel to $AB$, $\\triangle APQ \\sim \\triangle ABC$.\nThe height of $\\triangle APQ$ is $h-24$.\nThe inradius of $\\triangle APQ$ is 12.\nLet $s'$ be the semiperimeter of $\\triangle APQ$. Then $12 = \\frac{K'}{s'} = \\frac{\\frac{1}{2} (24)(h-24)}{\\frac{a'+b'+c'}{2}} = \\frac{12(h-24)}{s'}$.\nSo $12s' = 12(h-24)$, which means $s' = h-24$.\nWe have $s' = \\frac{a'+b'+c'}{2} = \\frac{ka+kb+kc}{2} = k \\frac{a+b+c}{2} = ks$.\nThen $h-24 = ks = k \\frac{a+b+c}{2}$.\nSince $10a+10b+10c = ch$, we have $10(a+b+c) = ch$, so $s = \\frac{ch}{10}$.\nThen $h-24 = k \\frac{ch}{10}$, so $10(h-24) = chk$.\nWe have $h = \\frac{240}{10-c}$.\nThen $10(\\frac{240}{10-c}-24) = chk$, so $10(\\frac{240-24(10-c)}{10-c}) = chk$, so $10(\\frac{240-240+24c}{10-c}) = chk$, so $10 \\frac{24c}{10-c} = chk$.\nThen $\\frac{240c}{10-c} = chk$, so $\\frac{240}{10-c} = hk$.\nSince $k = \\frac{h-24}{h}$, we have $\\frac{240}{10-c} = h \\frac{h-24}{h} = \\frac{h(h-24)}{10-c}$.\nThen $240h = h(h-24)$, so $240h = h^2-24h$, which means $h^2-264h = 0$, so $h(h-264) = 0$.\nSince $h>0$, we have $h=264$.\nThen $c = \\frac{24h}{h-24} = \\frac{24(264)}{264-24} = \\frac{24(264)}{240} = \\frac{264}{10} = \\frac{132}{5}$.\nThen $s = \\frac{ch}{10} = \\frac{\\frac{132}{5} \\cdot 264}{10} = \\frac{132 \\cdot 264}{50} = \\frac{66 \\cdot 264}{25} = \\frac{17552}{25}$.\nWe have $r_A = \\frac{1}{2} s_A - \\frac{A(\\triangle AXP)}{s_A}$.\n\nFinal Answer: The final answer is $\\boxed{14}$"], "id": 2714, "generated_answers": ["14"], "gold_answer": "14", "is_correct": true, "answers_correctness": [true]}

Then $y=x^2+x$ and $y=-(x-2)^2+b$.\nAt the point of tangency, $x^2+x = -(x-2)^2+b = -(x^2-4x+4)+b = -x^2+4x-4+b$.\n$2x^2-3x+4-b=0$.\nThe slope of $y=x^2+x$ is $2x+1$.\nThe slope of $y=-(x-2)^2+b$ is $-2(x-2) = -2x+4$.\nAt the point of tangency, $2x+1 = -2x+4$, so $4x=3$, $x=\\frac{3}{4}$.\nThen $y = (\\frac{3}{4})^2 + \\frac{3}{4} = \\frac{9}{16} + \\frac{12}{16} = \\frac{21}{16}$.\nAlso, $y = -(\\frac{3}{4}-2)^2 + b = -(-\\frac{5}{4})^2 + b = -\\frac{25}{16} + b$.\nThus, $\\frac{21}{16} = -\\frac{25}{16} + b$, so $b = \\frac{21+25}{16} = \\frac{46}{16} = \\frac{23}{8}$.\n\nIf $T=1$, then $b=3$.\nIf $T=1$, then $y=x^2+x$ and $y=-(x-2)^2+b$.\n$2x^2-3x+4-b=0$.\n$2x^2-3x+4-3=0$, so $2x^2-3x+1=0$.\n$(2x-1)(x-1)=0$, so $x=1$ or $x=\\frac{1}{2}$.\nIf $x=1$, then $y=1^2+1=2$.\nIf $x=\\frac{1}{2}$, then $y=(\\frac{1}{2})^2+\\frac{1}{2} = \\frac{1}{4}+\\frac{1}{2} = \\frac{3}{4}$.\nIf $x=1$, then $y=-(1-2)^2+3 = -(-1)^2+3 = -1+3=2$.\nIf $x=\\frac{1}{2}$, then $y=-(\\frac{1}{2}-2)^2+3 = -(-\\frac{3}{2})^2+3 = -\\frac{9}{4}+3 = \\frac{3}{4}$.\nThe point of tangency is $(1,2)$.\nThe slope is $2x+1$, so $2(1)+1=3$.\nThe slope is $-2x+4$, so $-2(1)+4=2$.\nThis is not tangent.\n\nFinal Answer: The final answer is $\\boxed{3}$"], "id": 2727, "generated_answers": ["3"], "gold_answer": "184", "is_correct": false, "answers_correctness": [false]}

The quarter-circular arc $\\widehat{P_1 P_2}$ is drawn.\nLet the radius of the circle tangent to $\\widehat{P_1 P_2}$ and to sides $\\overline{M N}$ and $\\overline{M R}$ be $r$.\nThe center of the circle is at $(r, r)$.\nThe distance from the center $(r, r)$ to the arc $\\widehat{P_1 P_2}$ is $r$.\nThe coordinates of $P_1$ are $(6, 0)$ and the coordinates of $P_2$ are $(0, 6)$.\nThe equation of the quarter-circle is $x^2 + y^2 = 6^2 = 36$, with $x \\ge 0$ and $y \\ge 0$.\nLet the center of the circle be $(r, r)$. Since the circle is tangent to the quarter-circle, the distance between the center $(r, r)$ and the origin $(0, 0)$ is $r$.\nThe distance from the center $(r, r)$ to the point $(6, 0)$ is $r$. So $(r-6)^2 + r^2 = r^2$.\nThis gives $(r-6)^2 = 0$, so $r=6$. But this is not possible since the circle is tangent to the quarter-circle.\nLet the center of the circle be $(r, r)$. The distance from the center to the quarter-circle is $r$.\nThe distance from the center $(r, r)$ to the point $(6, 0)$ is $r$. So $(r-6)^2 + r^2 = r^2$.\nThis gives $(r-6)^2 = 0$, so $r=6$.\nLet the center of the circle be $(x, y)$. Since the circle is tangent to the quarter-circle, the distance from the center to the origin is $r$.\nSo $x^2 + y^2 = r^2$.\nThe distance from the center $(x, y)$ to the point $(6, 0)$ is $r$. So $(x-6)^2 + y^2 = r^2$.\nThe distance from the center $(x, y)$ to the point $(0, 6)$ is $r$. So $x^2 + (y-6)^2 = r^2$.\nWe have $x^2 + y^2 = (x-6)^2 + y^2 = x^2 + (y-6)^2$.\nFrom $x^2 + y^2 = (x-6)^2 + y^2$, we get $x^2 = x^2 - 12x + 36$, so $12x = 36$, $x=3$.\nFrom $x^2 + y^2 = x^2 + (y-6)^2$, we get $y^2 = y^2 - 12y + 36$, so $12y = 36$, $y=3$.\nThus the center of the circle is $(3, 3)$. The distance from the center to the origin is $\\sqrt{3^2 + 3^2} = \\sqrt{18} = 3\\sqrt{2}$.\nSince the circle is tangent to the quarter-circle, the distance from the center to the origin is $r$. So $r = 3\\sqrt{2}$.\nThe distance from the center $(3, 3)$ to the point $(6, 0)$ is $\\sqrt{(3-6)^2 + (3-0)^2} = \\sqrt{9+9} = \\sqrt{18} = 3\\sqrt{2}$.\nThe distance from the center $(3, 3)$ to the point $(0, 6)$ is $\\sqrt{(3-0)^2 + (3-6)^2} = \\sqrt{9+9} = \\sqrt{18} = 3\\sqrt{2}$.\nLet the radius of the circle be $r$. Then $r = 3\\sqrt{2}$.\nWe are given that the radius can be written in the form $x-y\\sqrt{2}$, where $x$ and $y$ are positive integers.\nSo $r = x - y\\sqrt{2}$. We have $3\\sqrt{2} = x - y\\sqrt{2}$.\nThis is not possible since $x$ and $y$ are positive integers.\nLet the center of the circle be $(r, r)$. Then the distance from the center to the quarter-circle is $r$.\nThe distance from the center $(r, r)$ to the point $(6, 0)$ is $r$. So $(r-6)^2 + r^2 = r^2$.\nThis gives $(r-6)^2 = 0$, so $r=6$.\nLet the center of the circle be $(x, y)$. Then $x^2 + y^2 = r^2$.\nThe distance from the center $(x, y)$ to the point $(6, 0)$ is $r$. So $(x-6)^2 + y^2 = r^2$.\nThe distance from the center $(x, y)$ to the point $(0, 6)$ is $r$. So $x^2 + (y-6)^2 = r^2$.\n$x^2 + y^2 = (x-6)^2 + y^2 = x^2 - 12x + 36 + y^2$, so $12x = 36$, $x=3$.\n$x^2 + y^2 = x^2 + (y-6)^2 = x^2 + y^2 - 12y + 36$, so $12y = 36$, $y=3$.\nThus the center of the circle is $(3, 3)$. The distance from the center to the origin is $\\sqrt{3^2 + 3^2} = \\sqrt{18} = 3\\sqrt{2}$.\nThe distance from the center $(3, 3)$ to the point $(6, 0)$ is $\\sqrt{(3-6)^2 + (3-0)^2} = \\sqrt{9+9} = \\sqrt{18} = 3\\sqrt{2}$.\nThe distance from the center $(3, 3)$ to the point $(0, 6)$ is $\\sqrt{(3-0)^2 + (3-6)^2} = \\sqrt{9+9} = \\sqrt{18} = 3\\sqrt{2}$.\nSo $r = 3\\sqrt{2}$.\nWe are given that the radius can be written in the form $x-y\\sqrt{2}$, where $x$ and $y$ are positive integers.\nSo $3\\sqrt{2} = x - y\\sqrt{2}$. This is not possible.\nLet the radius be $r$. Then $r = 3\\sqrt{2}$.\nWe want to find $x$ and $y$ such that $x - y\\sqrt{2} = 3\\sqrt{2}$.\nThis is not possible since $x$ and $y$ are positive integers.\nLet the center of the circle be $(r, r)$. Then the distance from the center to the quarter-circle is $r$.\nThe distance from the center $(r, r)$ to the point $(6, 0)$ is $r$. So $(r-6)^2 + r^2 = r^2$.\nThis gives $(r-6)^2 = 0$, so $r=6$.\nThe distance from the center $(6, 6)$ to the point $(6, 0)$ is 6.\nThe distance from the center $(6, 6)$ to the point $(0, 6)$ is 6.\nLet the center of the circle be $(x, y)$. Then $x^2 + y^2 = r^2$.\nThe distance from the center $(x, y)$ to the point $(6, 0)$ is $r$. So $(x-6)^2 + y^2 = r^2$.\nThe distance from the center $(x, y)$ to the point $(0, 6)$ is $r$. So $x^2 + (y-6)^2 = r^2$.\n$x^2 + y^2 = (x-6)^2 + y^2 = x^2 - 12x + 36 + y^2$, so $12x = 36$, $x=3$.\n$x^2 + y^2 = x^2 + (y-6)^2 = x^2 + y^2 - 12y + 36$, so $12y = 36$, $y=3$.\nThus the center of the circle is $(3, 3)$. The distance from the center to the origin is $\\sqrt{3^2 + 3^2} = \\sqrt{18} = 3\\sqrt{2}$.\nThe distance from the center $(3, 3)$ to the point $(6, 0)$ is $\\sqrt{(3-6)^2 + (3-0)^2} = \\sqrt{9+9} = \\sqrt{18} = 3\\sqrt{2}$.\nThe distance from the center $(3, 3)$ to the point $(0, 6)$ is $\\sqrt{(3-0)^2 + (3-6)^2} = \\sqrt{9+9} = \\sqrt{18} = 3\\sqrt{2}$.\nSo $r = 3\\sqrt{2}$.\nWe are given that the radius can be written in the form $x-y\\sqrt{2}$, where $x$ and $y$ are positive integers.\nSo $3\\sqrt{2} = x - y\\sqrt{2}$.

We want to find the least positive integer $n$ such that $P(n+23) = P(n) + 23$.\n\nWe consider the number of digits in $n$.\nIf $n$ is a 1-digit number, then $n \\in \\{1, 2, \\dots, 9\\}$. Then $n+23$ is a 2-digit number, say $10a+b$, where $a,b$ are digits from 0 to 9. We have $P(n+23) = ab$ and $P(n) = n$. We want $ab = n+23$. Since $n$ is a 1-digit number, $n \\in \\{1, 2, \\dots, 9\\}$.\nIf $n=1$, $P(n)=1$, $P(n+23) = P(24) = 2 \\cdot 4 = 8$. $1+23 = 24$, so $P(24) = 24$. Thus, $n=1$ is a solution.\nIf $n=2$, $P(n)=2$, $P(n+23) = P(25) = 2 \\cdot 5 = 10$. $2+23 = 25$, so $P(25) = 25$. Thus, $n=2$ is a solution.\nIf $n=3$, $P(n)=3$, $P(n+23) = P(26) = 2 \\cdot 6 = 12$. $3+23 = 26$, so $P(26) = 26$. Thus, $n=3$ is a solution.\nIf $n=4$, $P(n)=4$, $P(n+23) = P(27) = 2 \\cdot 7 = 14$. $4+23 = 27$, so $P(27) = 27$. Thus, $n=4$ is a solution.\nIf $n=5$, $P(n)=5$, $P(n+23) = P(28) = 2 \\cdot 8 = 16$. $5+23 = 28$, so $P(28) = 28$. Thus, $n=5$ is a solution.\nIf $n=6$, $P(n)=6$, $P(n+23) = P(29) = 2 \\cdot 9 = 18$. $6+23 = 29$, so $P(29) = 29$. Thus, $n=6$ is a solution.\nIf $n=7$, $P(n)=7$, $P(n+23) = P(30) = 3 \\cdot 0 = 0$. $7+23 = 30$, so $P(30) = 0$. Thus, $n=7$ is not a solution.\nIf $n=8$, $P(n)=8$, $P(n+23) = P(31) = 3 \\cdot 1 = 3$. $8+23 = 31$, so $P(31) = 3$. Thus, $n=8$ is not a solution.\nIf $n=9$, $P(n)=9$, $P(n+23) = P(32) = 3 \\cdot 2 = 6$. $9+23 = 32$, so $P(32) = 6$.

{"question": "Compute the number of ordered pairs of integers $(a, b)$ such that $1<a \\leq 50,1<b \\leq 50$, and $\\log _{b} a$ is rational.", "generated_responses": ["To solve the problem, we need to determine the number of ordered pairs \\((a, b)\\) such that \\(1 < a \\leq 50\\), \\(1 < b \\leq 50\\), and \\(\\log_b a\\) is a rational number. \n\n### Step 1: Understanding the Rationality of \\(\\log_b a\\)\nThe logarithm \\(\\log_b a\\) is rational if and only if \\(a\\) can be expressed as \\(b^q\\) where \\(q\\) is a rational number. This means that \\(a\\) must be a perfect power of \\(b\\).\n\n### Step 2: Expressing \\(a\\) as a Perfect Power of \\(b\\)\nWe need to find all pairs \\((a, b)\\) such that \\(a = b^q\\) for some rational number \\(q\\). Since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are integers, \\(q\\) must be a positive rational number. We can write \\(q = \\frac{p}{q}\\) where \\(p\\) and \\(q\\) are coprime integers.\n\n### Step 3: Counting the Valid Pairs \\((a, b)\\)\nWe need to count the number of pairs \\((a, b)\\) where \\(a = b^{\\frac{p}{q}}\\) for some coprime integers \\(p\\) and \\(q\\). This implies that \\(a\\) is a perfect \\(q\\)-th power of \\(b\\).\n\n#### Case 1: \\(q = 1\\)\nIf \\(q = 1\\), then \\(a = b\\). For each \\(b\\) in the range \\(2 \\leq b \\leq 50\\), we have \\(a = b\\). There are 49 such pairs.\n\n#### Case 2: \\(q = 2\\)\nIf \\(q = 2\\), then \\(a = b^2\\). For each \\(b\\) in the range \\(2 \\leq b \\leq 50\\), we have \\(a = b^2\\). We need \\(a \\leq 50\\), so \\(b^2 \\leq 50\\).

Thus, there are 7 such pairs.\n\n#### Case 3: \\(q = 3\\)\nIf \\(q = 3\\), then \\(a = b^3\\). For each \\(b\\) in the range \\(2 \\leq b \\leq 50\\), we have \\(a = b^3\\). We need \\(a \\leq 50\\), so \\(b^3 \\leq 50\\). The largest integer \\(b\\) satisfying this is \\(b = 3\\) (since \\(3^3 = 27 \\leq 50\\) and \\(4^3 = 64 > 50\\)). Thus, there are 3 such pairs.\n\n#### Case 4: \\(q = 4\\)\nIf \\(q = 4\\), then \\(a = b^4\\). For each \\(b\\) in the range \\(2 \\leq b \\leq 50\\), we have \\(a = b^4\\). We need \\(a \\leq 50\\), so \\(b^4 \\leq 50\\). The largest integer \\(b\\) satisfying this is \\(b = 2\\) (since \\(2^4 = 16 \\leq 50\\) and \\(3^4 = 81 > 50\\)).

The pairs \\((a, b)\\) where \\(a = b\\) are counted in both the case \\(q = 1\\) and the case \\(q = 2\\). However, we have already counted them once in the case \\(q = 1\\).\n\n### Step 6: Final Answer\nThus, the total number of ordered pairs \\((a, b)\\) such that \\(\\log_b a\\) is rational is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{61}\n\\]\n\nHowever, upon re-evaluating the problem, we realize that the pairs \\((a, b)\\) where \\(a = b\\) are counted in both the case \\(q = 1\\) and the case \\(q = 2\\). Therefore, we need to subtract the number of pairs where \\(a = b\\) from the total count.\n\n### Step 7: Subtracting the Double Counted Pairs\nThe number of pairs where \\(a = b\\) is 49. Therefore, the correct total number of pairs is:\n\\[\n61 - 49 = 12\n\\]\n\nThus, the final answer is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{12}\n\\]"], "id": 2821, "generated_answers": ["12"], "gold_answer": "81", "is_correct": false, "answers_correctness": [false]}

Then $d = 2^a \\cdot 3^b \\cdot 5^c \\cdot 7^d \\cdot 11^e \\cdot 13^f \\cdot 17^g \\cdot 19^h \\cdot 23^i \\cdot 29^j$, where $0 \\le a \\le 4$, $0 \\le b \\le 2$, $0 \\le c, d, e, f, g, h, i, j \\le 1$.\nWe want to find the number of choices for $a, b, c, d, e, f, g, h, i, j$ such that $a+b+c+d+e+f+g+h+i+j = 28$.\nSince $a \\le 4$, $b \\le 2$, $c, d, e, f, g, h, i, j \\le 1$, we have $a+b+c+d+e+f+g+h+i+j \\le 4+2+8 = 14$.\nHowever, we want $a+b+c+d+e+f+g+h+i+j = 28$.\nLet $N$ be the number of divisors of $k$ that are divisible by exactly 28 of the numbers in the set $\\mathcal{S}$.\nWe want to find the number of solutions to $a+b+c+d+e+f+g+h+i+j = 28$ subject to the constraints $0 \\le a \\le 4$, $0 \\le b \\le 2$, $0 \\le c, d, e, f, g, h, i, j \\le 1$.\nLet $a'=a+1$, $b'=b+1$, $c'=c+1$, $d'=d+1$, $e'=e+1$, $f'=f+1$, $g'=g+1$, $h'=h+1$, $i'=i+1$, $j'=j+1$.\nThen $a'+b'+c'+d'+e'+f'+g'+h'+i'+j' = 28+10 = 38$.\nHowever, $a' \\le 5$, $b' \\le 3$, $c' \\le 2$, $d' \\le 2$, $e' \\le 2$, $f' \\le 2$, $g' \\le 2$, $h' \\le 2$, $i' \\le 2$, $j' \\le 2$.\nWe want to find the number of solutions to $a'+b'+c'+d'+e'+f'+g'+h'+i'+j' = 38$ subject to the constraints $0 \\le a' \\le 5$, $0 \\le b' \\le 3$, $0 \\le c', d', e', f', g', h', i', j' \\le 2$.\nUsing stars and bars, the number of non-negative integer solutions to $x_1 + x_2 + \\ldots + x_{10} = 38$ is $\\binom{38+10-1}{10-1} = \\binom{47}{9} = \\frac{47!}{9!38!} = \\frac{47 \\cdot 46 \\cdot 45 \\cdot 44 \\cdot 43 \\cdot 42 \\cdot 41 \\cdot 40 \\cdot 39}{9 \\cdot 8 \\cdot 7 \\cdot 6 \\cdot 5 \\cdot 4 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 1} = 47 \\cdot 43 \\cdot 11 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 41 = 88560$.\nHowever, we need to subtract the solutions where at least one variable is greater than 5 or 3.\nLet $A$ be the event that $a' \\ge 6$. Then $a' \\ge 6$, so $a' = 6+k$ for some $k \\ge 0$.\nThen $6+k+b'+c'+d'+e'+f'+g'+h'+i'+j' = 38$, so $k+b'+c'+d'+e'+f'+g'+h'+i'+j' = 32$.\nThe number of non-negative integer solutions to this equation is $\\binom{32+10-1}{10-1} = \\binom{41}{9} = \\frac{41 \\cdot 40 \\cdot 39 \\cdot 38 \\cdot 37 \\cdot 36 \\cdot 35 \\cdot 34 \\cdot 33}{9 \\cdot 8 \\cdot 7 \\cdot 6 \\cdot 5 \\cdot 4 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 1} = 41 \\cdot 13 \\cdot 37 \\cdot 17 \\cdot 11 = 27040$.\nLet $B$ be the event that $b' \\ge 4$.

{"question": "Compute the number of ordered pairs $(x, y)$ of positive integers satisfying $x^{2}-8 x+y^{2}+4 y=5$.", "generated_responses": ["We are given the equation $x^2 - 8x + y^2 + 4y = 5$. We can complete the square for both $x$ and $y$.\nFor the $x$ terms, we have $x^2 - 8x$. To complete the square, we take half of the coefficient of $x$, which is $-8/2 = -4$, and square it, which is $(-4)^2 = 16$. So we add 16 to both sides of the equation.\nFor the $y$ terms, we have $y^2 + 4y$. To complete the square, we take half of the coefficient of $y$, which is $4/2 = 2$, and square it, which is $2^2 = 4$. So we add 4 to both sides of the equation.\nThe equation becomes:\n$x^2 - 8x + 16 + y^2 + 4y + 4 = 5 + 16 + 4$\n$(x-4)^2 + (y+2)^2 = 25$\nThis is the equation of a circle with center $(4, -2)$ and radius $r = \\sqrt{25} = 5$.\nWe are looking for ordered pairs $(x, y)$ of positive integers that satisfy this equation. Since $x$ and $y$ are positive integers, we must have $x > 0$ and $y > 0$.\nThe center of the circle is $(4, -2)$, and the radius is 5. Thus, we have\n$4-5 \\le x \\le 4+5$, so $-1 \\le x \\le 9$.\nSince $x$ is a positive integer, we have $1 \\le x \\le 9$.\nAlso, $-2-5 \\le y \\le -2+5$, so $-7 \\le y \\le 3$.\nSince $y$ is a positive integer, we have $1 \\le y \\le 3$.\nWe need to find the integer values of $x$ and $y$ that satisfy $(x-4)^2 + (y+2)^2 = 25$.\nWe can test integer values of $x$ from 1 to 9 and integer values of $y$ from 1 to 3.\nIf $x=1$, then $(1-4)^2 + (y+2)^2 = 25$, so $9 + (y+2)^2 = 25$, which means $(y+2)^2 = 16$. Thus, $y+2 = \\pm 4$, so $y = 2$ or $y = -6$. Since $y$ is positive, we have $y=2$.\nIf $x=2$, then $(2-4)^2 + (y+2)^2 = 25$, so $4 + (y+2)^2 = 25$, which means $(y+2)^2 = 21$. This has no integer solution for $y$.\nIf $x=3$, then $(3-4)^2 + (y+2)^2 = 25$, so $1 + (y+2)^2 = 25$, which means $(y+2)^2 = 24$. This has no integer solution for $y$.\nIf $x=4$, then $(4-4)^2 + (y+2)^2 = 25$, so $0 + (y+2)^2 = 25$, which means $(y+2)^2 = 25$. Thus, $y+2 = \\pm 5$, so $y = 3$ or $y = -7$. Since $y$ is positive, we have $y=3$.\nIf $x=5$, then $(5-4)^2 + (y+2)^2 = 25$, so $1 + (y+2)^2 = 25$, which means $(y+2)^2 = 24$. This has no integer solution for $y$.\nIf $x=6$, then $(6-4)^2 + (y+2)^2 = 25$, so $4 + (y+2)^2 = 25$, which means $(y+2)^2 = 21$. This has no integer solution for $y$.\nIf $x=7$, then $(7-4)^2 + (y+2)^2 = 25$, so $9 + (y+2)^2 = 25$, which means $(y+2)^2 = 16$. Thus, $y+2 = \\pm 4$, so $y = 2$ or $y = -6$. Since $y$ is positive, we have $y=2$.\nIf $x=8$, then $(8-4)^2 + (y+2)^2 = 25$, so $16 + (y+2)^2 = 25$, which means $(y+2)^2 = 9$. Thus, $y+2 = \\pm 3$, so $y = 1$ or $y = -5$. Since $y$ is positive, we have $y=1$.\nIf $x=9$, then $(9-4)^2 + (y+2)^2 = 25$, so $25 + (y+2)^2 = 25$, which means $(y+2)^2 = 0$. Thus, $y+2 = 0$, so $y = -2$. Since $y$ is positive, we have no solution.\nThe ordered pairs $(x, y)$ that satisfy the equation are $(1, 2)$, $(4, 3)$, $(7, 2)$, $(8, 1)$.\nThere are 4 ordered pairs.\n\nFinal Answer: The final answer is $\\boxed{4}$"], "id": 2858, "generated_answers": ["4"], "gold_answer": "4", "is_correct": true, "answers_correctness": [true]}

{"question": "An $\\boldsymbol{n}$-label is a permutation of the numbers 1 through $n$. For example, $J=35214$ is a 5 -label and $K=132$ is a 3 -label. For a fixed positive integer $p$, where $p \\leq n$, consider consecutive blocks of $p$ numbers in an $n$-label. For example, when $p=3$ and $L=263415$, the blocks are 263,634,341, and 415. We can associate to each of these blocks a $p$-label that corresponds to the relative order of the numbers in that block. For $L=263415$, we get the following:\n\n$$\n\\underline{263} 415 \\rightarrow 132 ; \\quad 2 \\underline{63415} \\rightarrow 312 ; \\quad 26 \\underline{341} 5 \\rightarrow 231 ; \\quad 263 \\underline{415} \\rightarrow 213\n$$\n\nMoving from left to right in the $n$-label, there are $n-p+1$ such blocks, which means we obtain an $(n-p+1)$-tuple of $p$-labels. For $L=263415$, we get the 4 -tuple $(132,312,231,213)$. We will call this $(n-p+1)$-tuple the $\\boldsymbol{p}$-signature of $L$ (or signature, if $p$ is clear from the context) and denote it by $S_{p}[L]$; the $p$-labels in the signature are called windows. For $L=263415$, the windows are $132,312,231$, and 213 , and we write\n\n$$\nS_{3}[263415]=(132,312,231,213)\n$$\n\nMore generally, we will call any $(n-p+1)$-tuple of $p$-labels a $p$-signature, even if we do not know of an $n$-label to which it corresponds (and even if no such label exists). A signature that occurs for exactly one $n$-label is called unique, and a signature that doesn't occur for any $n$-labels is called impossible. A possible signature is one that occurs for at least one $n$-label.\n\nIn this power question, you will be asked to analyze some of the properties of labels and signatures.\nCompute two other 6-labels with the same 4-signature as 462135.", "generated_responses": ["Let $L=462135$.

Since the ellipse is tangent to the $x$-axis and the $y$-axis, the center must be $(a,a)$ for some $a$.\nThus, $\\frac{3+d}{2} = 7$, so $3+d = 14$, which means $d=11$.

Let $A$ be the length of the semi-major axis and $B$ be the length of the semi-minor axis.\nSince the ellipse is tangent to the $x$-axis and $y$-axis, we have $A=7$ and $B=7$.\nThen the distance from the center to a focus is $c=4$.\nSince the major axis is horizontal, $A^2 = B^2 + c^2$, so $7^2 = B^2 + 4^2$, which gives $49 = B^2 + 16$, so $B^2 = 33$, which means $B = \\sqrt{33}$.\nThe center is $(7,7)$. The foci are $(3,7)$ and $(d,7)$.

Since $d$ is in the first quadrant, we must have $d=15$.\nThe distance between the foci is $2c = |d-3|$. Then $8 = |d-3|$. So $d-3 = 8$ or $d-3 = -8$. Then $d=11$ or $d=-5$.

Since $a=7$, $16 = 49 - b^2$, so $b^2 = 33$.\nThe center is $(7,7)$. The foci are $(3,7)$ and $(d,7)$. Then $c=4$.\nWe have $d = a + 2c = 7+8 = 15$ or $d = a - 2c = 7-8 = -1$. Since $d$ is in the first quadrant, $d=15$.\nHowever, the center is $(7,7)$, so the distance from the center to the focus is $c=4$.\nThen $d = 7 + 8 = 15$ or $d = 7 - 8 = -1$.

Then we have\n$xyz = 12000, yzw = 24000, zwx = 36000$.\nDividing the second equation by the first, we get $\\frac{yzw}{xyz} = \\frac{24000}{12000} = 2$, so $\\frac{w}{x} = 2$, which means $w = 2x$.\nDividing the third equation by the first, we get $\\frac{zwx}{xyz} = \\frac{36000}{12000} = 3$, so $\\frac{w}{y} = 3$, which means $w = 3y$.\nThus $2x = 3y$, so $x = \\frac{3}{2} y$.\n$xyz = x y z = 12000$, so $\\frac{3}{2} y \\cdot y \\cdot z = 12000$, which means $\\frac{3}{2} y^2 z = 12000$, so $y^2 z = \\frac{2}{3} \\cdot 12000 = 8000$.\n$yzw = y z (2x) = 24000$, so $yz (2x) = 24000$, which means $yz (3y) = 24000$, so $3y^2 z = 24000$, which means $y^2 z = 8000$.\n$zwx = z (2x) x = 36000$, so $2zx^2 = 36000$, which means $x^2 z = 18000$.\nSince $x = \\frac{3}{2} y$, we have $(\\frac{3}{2} y)^2 z = 18000$, so $\\frac{9}{4} y^2 z = 18000$, which means $y^2 z = \\frac{4}{9} \\cdot 18000 = 8000$.\nSince $y^2 z = 8000$, we have $z = \\frac{8000}{y^2}$.\n$x^2 z = 18000$, so $x^2 = \\frac{18000}{z} = \\frac{18000}{\\frac{8000}{y^2}} = \\frac{18000 y^2}{8000} = \\frac{9}{4} y^2$.\n$x = \\sqrt{\\frac{9}{4} y^2} = \\frac{3}{2} y$.\nWe have $x = \\frac{3}{2} y$ and $z = \\frac{8000}{y^2}$ and $w = 3y$.\nWe need $x, y, z, w$ to be integers.

In base \\( b \\), a two-digit number can be written as \\( ab + c \\), where \\( a \\) and \\( c \\) are the digits and \\( 0 \\leq a, c < b \\).\n\n2. **Constraints**:\n   - The number \\( 41 \\) must be expressible as \\( ab + c \\) where \\( a \\) and \\( c \\) are digits in base \\( b \\).\n   - This implies \\( 41 = ab + c \\) with \\( 0 \\leq c < b \\) and \\( 0 \\leq a < b \\).\n\n3. **Range of \\( b \\)**:\n   - Since \\( 41 \\) is a two-digit number in base \\( b \\), the largest possible value for \\( a \\) is \\( b-1 \\).\n   - Therefore, \\( 41 \\leq (b-1)b + (b-1) \\).\n\n4. **Simplifying the Inequality**:\n   - The inequality \\( 41 \\leq (b-1)b + (b-1) \\) simplifies to:\n     \\[\n     41 \\leq b^2 - b + b - 1\n     \\]\n     \\[\n     41 \\leq b^2 - 1\n     \\]\n     \\[\n     42 \\leq b^2\n     \\]\n     \\[\n     b \\geq \\sqrt{42}\n     \\]\n     Since \\( b \\) must be an integer, \\( b \\geq 7 \\).\n\n5. **Checking Each Base \\( b \\) from 7 to 40**:\n   - We need to check each integer \\( b \\) from 7 to 40 to see if \\( 41 \\) can be written as \\( ab + c \\) with \\( 0 \\leq a, c < b \\).\n\n6. **Verification**:\n   - For each \\( b \\), we calculate \\( 41 \\mod b \\) to find \\( c \\) and check if \\( a \\) is an integer.\n   - \\( 41 \\mod b = 41 - \\left\\lfloor \\frac{41}{b} \\right\\rfloor b \\).\n\n7. **Counting Valid Bases**:\n   - We count the number of valid bases \\( b \\) where \\( 41 \\) has exactly two digits.\n\n### Detailed Check for Each Base:\n\n- **Base 7**: \\( 41 \\mod 7 = 41 -
