Then $j = \\frac{k+12}{2}$. Since $j$ is an integer, $k$ is even.\nWe have $1 \\le j \\le 12$, so $-10 \\le k \\le 12$.\nSo we have $\\sum_{k=-10}^{12} \\binom{\\frac{k+12}{2}}{k}$.\nWe have $\\sum_{j=1}^{12} \\binom{j}{12-j} = \\sum_{j=1}^{12} \\binom{j}{j - (12-j)} = \\sum_{j=1}^{12} \\binom{j}{2j-12}$.\nWe can rewrite this as $\\sum_{j=1}^{12} \\binom{j}{12-j} = \\sum_{j=1}^{12} \\binom{j}{j - (12-j)} = \\sum_{j=1}^{12} \\binom{j}{12-j}$.\nWe have $\\sum_{j=1}^{12} \\binom{j}{12-j} = \\sum_{j=1}^{12} \\binom{j}{j - (12-j)} = \\sum_{j=1}^{12} \\binom{j}{2j-12}$.\nWe have $\\sum_{j=1}^{12} \\binom{j}{12-j} = \\sum_{j=1}^{12} \\binom{j}{j - (12-j)} = \\sum_{j=1}^{12} \\binom{j}{12-j}$.\nLet $N = \\sum_{j=1}^{12} \\binom{j}{12-j}$.\nThen $N = \\sum_{j=1}^{12} \\binom{j}{12-j} = \\sum_{j=1}^{12} \\binom{j}{j - (12-j)} = \\sum_{j=1}^{12} \\binom{j}{2j-12}$.\nWe have $\\sum_{j=1}^{12} \\binom{j}{12-j} = \\sum_{j=1}^{12} \\binom{j}{j - (12-j)} = \\sum_{j=1}^{12} \\binom{j}{12-j}$.\nWe have $\\sum_{j=1}^{12} \\binom{j}{12-j} = \\sum_{j=1}^{12} \\binom{j}{j - (12-j)} = \\sum_{j=1}^{12} \\binom{j}{12-j}$.\nWe have $\\sum_{j=1}^{12} \\binom{j}{12-j} = \\sum_{j=1}^{12} \\binom{j}{j - (12-j)} = \\sum_{j=1}^{12} \\binom{j}{12-j}$.\nWe have $\\sum_{j=1}^{12} \\binom{j}{12-j} = \\sum_{j=1}^{12} \\binom{j}{j - (12-j)} = \\sum_{j=1}^{12} \\binom{j}{12-j}$.\nWe have $\\sum_{j=1}^{12} \\binom{j}{12-j} = \\sum_{j=1}^{12} \\binom{j}{j - (12-j)} = \\sum_{j=1}^{12} \\binom{j}{12-j}$.\n\nConsider the case $k=1$. Then $|B| = 1$, so $B = \\{1\\}$.\nConsider the case $k=2$. Then $|B| = 2$, so $B = \\{2, x\\}$ for some $x \\in S$. We have $2 \\le x \\le 12$, so $11$ possibilities.\nConsider the case $k=3$. Then $|B| = 3$, so $B = \\{3, x, y\\}$ for some $x, y \\in S$. We have $3 \\le x \\le 12$ and $3 \\le y \\le 12$. So $10$ possibilities for $x$ and $10$ possibilities for $y$. But we need to consider the order of $x$ and $y$. Since $x$ and $y$ are distinct, we have $10 \\times 9 = 90$ possibilities. But we are looking for subsets, so we need to divide by $2$. So we have $\\binom{10}{2} = 45$ possibilities.\nIn general, if $k=n$, then $|B| = n$, so $B = \\{n, x_1, x_2, \\dots, x_{n-1}\\}$ for some $x_1, x_2, \\dots, x_{n-1} \\in S$. Since $k=n$, we must have $n \\le x_i \\le 12$ for all $i = 1, \\dots, n-1$. So each $x_i$ can be $n, n+1, \\dots, 12$, which gives $12-n+1 = 13-n$ possibilities.\nWe need to choose $n-1$ elements from the set $\\{n, n+1, \\dots, 12\\}$. The number of ways to do this is $\\binom{13-n}{n-1}$.\nSo we want to find $\\sum_{n=1}^{12} \\binom{13-n}{n-1}$.\nLet $j = 13-n$. Then $n = 13-j$, and $n-1 = 12-j$. So we want to find $\\sum_{j=1}^{12} \\binom{j}{12-j}$.\nWe know that $\\binom{j}{12-j} = \\binom{j}{j - (12-j)} = \\binom{j}{2j-12}$.\nWe have $\\sum_{j=1}^{12} \\binom{j}{12-j} = \\sum_{j=1}^{12} \\binom{j}{j - (12-j)} = \\sum_{j=1}^{12} \\binom{j}{2j-12}$.\nLet $k = 2j-12$. Then $2j = k+12$, so $j = \\frac{k+12}{2}$. Since $j$ is an integer, $k$ must be even.\nWhen $j=1$, $k = 2(1)-12 = -10$. When $j=12$, $k = 2(12)-12 = 12$.\nSo we have $\\sum_{k=-10}^{12} \\binom{\\frac{k+12}{2}}{k}$. However, we need to consider the range of $k$.\nSince $j \\ge 1$, we have $k+12 \\ge 2$, so $k \\ge -10$. Also, $j \\le 12$, so $k+12 \\le 24$, so $k \\le 12$.\nAlso, we need $k$ to be even. So we have $k = -10, -8, \\dots, 12$.\n$\\sum_{j=1}^{12} \\binom{j}{12-j} = \\sum_{j=1}^{12} \\binom{j}{j - (12-j)} = \\sum_{j=1}^{12} \\binom{j}{2j-12}$.\nWe have $\\sum_{j=1}^{12} \\binom{j}{12-j} = \\sum_{j=1}^{12} \\binom{j}{j - (12-j)} = \\sum_{j=1}^{12} \\binom{j}{12-j}$.\nWe have $\\sum_{j=1}^{12} \\binom{j}{12-j} = \\sum_{j=1}^{12} \\binom{j}{j - (12-j)} = \\sum_{j=1}^{12} \\binom{j}{12-j}$.\nLet $N = \\sum_{j=1}^{12} \\binom{j}{12-j}$.\nThen $N = \\sum_{j=1}^{12} \\binom{j}{12-j} = \\sum_{j=1}^{12} \\binom{j}{j - (12-j)} = \\sum_{j=1}^{12} \\binom{j}{2j-12}$.\nLet $k = 2j-12$. Then $j = \\frac{k+12}{2}$.\nSince $1 \\le j \\le 12$, we have $1 \\le \\frac{k+12}{2} \\le 12$, so $2 \\le k+12 \\le 24$, so $-10 \\le k \\le 12$.\nAlso, $k$ must be even.
