Instead, we can use the fact that the denominator is the same to write:\n$$\\frac{3.091 \\times 10^{-5}}{5.26 \\times 10^{-3}} = \\frac{1}{1 + \\frac{1}{\\omega} \\frac{1}{x}}$$\n$$\\frac{3.091}{526}

{"question": "Preamble: You have been asked to analyze the market for steel. From public sources, you are able to find that last year's price for steel was $\\$ 20$ per ton. At this price, 100 million tons were sold on the world market. From trade association data you are able to obtain estimates for the own price elasticities of demand and supply on the world markets as $-0.25$ for demand and $0.5$ for supply. Assume that steel has linear demand and supply curves throughout, and that the market is competitive.\n\nSolve for the equations of demand in this market.  Use $P$ to represent the price of steel in dollars per ton, and $X_{d}$ to represent the demand in units of millions of tons.", "generated_responses": ["Let $P$ be the price of steel in dollars per ton and $X_d$ be the demand in units of millions of tons.\nWe are given that last year's price was $P_0 = \\$20$ per ton, and the quantity sold was $X_{d0} = 100$ million tons.\nWe are also given that the own price elasticity of demand is $-0.25$ and the own price elasticity of supply is $0.5$.\n\nThe price elasticity of demand is given by $\\frac{dX_d}{dP} \\cdot \\frac{P}{X_d} = -0.25$.\nThe price elasticity of supply is given by $\\frac{dX_s}{dP} \\cdot \\frac{P}{X_s} = 0.5$.\n\nSince the market is competitive, the price is determined by the intersection of the demand and supply curves. Thus, $P = P_s = P_d$.\nWe can write the demand equation as $X_d = a - bP$, where $a$ and $b$ are constants.\nThe price elasticity of demand is $\\frac{dX_d}{dP} = -b$. Thus, $-b \\cdot \\frac{P}{X_d} = -0.25$, so $b = 0.25 \\cdot \\frac{X_d}{P}$.\nSince $P = \\$20$ and $X_d = 100$, we have $b = 0.25 \\cdot \\frac{100}{20} = 0.25 \\cdot 5 = 1.25$.\nThen the demand equation is $X_d = a - 1.25P$.\nSince $P = \\$20$ and $X_d = 100$, we have $100 = a - 1.25(20) = a - 25$. Thus, $a = 100 + 25 = 125$.\nSo the demand equation is $X_d = 125 - 1.25P$.\n\nWe can also write the supply equation as $X_s = c + dP$, where $c$ and $d$ are constants.\nThe price elasticity of supply is $\\frac{dX_s}{dP} = d$. Thus, $d \\cdot \\frac{P}{X_s} = 0.5$, so $d = 0.5 \\cdot \\frac{X_s}{P}$.\nSince $P = \\$20$ and $X_s = 100$, we have $d = 0.5 \\cdot \\frac{100}{20} = 0.5 \\cdot 5 = 2.5$.\nThen the supply equation is $X_s = c + 2.5P$.\nSince $P = \\$20$ and $X_s = 100$, we have $100 = c + 2.5(20) = c + 50$. Thus, $c = 100 - 50 = 50$.\nSo the supply equation is $X_s = 50 + 2.5P$.\n\nThe intersection of the demand and supply curves is given by $X_d = X_s$, so $125 - 1.25P = 50 + 2.5P$.\n$125 - 50 = 2.5P + 1.25P$, so $75 = 3.75P$. Thus, $P = \\frac{75}{3.75} = \\frac{7500}{375} = \\frac{300}{15} = 20$.\nSo the price is $P = \\$20$.\nThen $X_d = 125 - 1.25(20) = 125 - 25 = 100$.\n$X_s = 50 + 2.5(20) = 50 + 50 = 100$.\nSo the quantity sold is 100 million tons.\n\nFinal Answer: The final answer is $\\boxed{X_d = 125 - 1.25P}$"], "generated_answers": ["X_d = 125 - 1.25P"], "gold_answer": "X_{d}=125-1.25 P", "is_correct": false, "answers_correctness": [false]}
