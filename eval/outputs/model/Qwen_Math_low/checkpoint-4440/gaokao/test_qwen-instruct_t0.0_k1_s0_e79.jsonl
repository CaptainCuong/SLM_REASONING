We want to find the values of $a$ such that $f(x) = 0$ has exactly one solution.\n\nFirst, consider the case $ax-2 \\geq 0$, i.e., $ax \\geq 2$. Then $|ax-2| = ax-2$. The equation becomes\n$$2 \\sqrt{x^2 - ax} - (ax-2) + 1 = 0$$\n$$2 \\sqrt{x^2 - ax} = ax-3$$\nSquaring both sides, we get\n$$4(x^2 - ax) = (ax-3)^2$$\n$$4x^2 - 4ax = a^2 x^2 - 6ax + 9$$\n$$(a^2 - 4) x^2 + 2ax - 9 = 0$$\nIf $a^2 - 4 \\neq 0$, then $x = \\frac{-2a \\pm \\sqrt{4a^2 - 4(a^2 - 4)(-9)}}{2(a^2 - 4)} = \\frac{-2a \\pm \\sqrt{4a^2 + 36a^2 - 144}}{2(a^2 - 4)} = \\frac{-2a \\pm \\sqrt{40a^2 - 144}}{2(a^2 - 4)} = \\frac{-a \\pm \\sqrt{10a^2 - 36}}{a^2 - 4}$.\nWe need exactly one solution, so we need either the discriminant to be zero, or the two solutions to be one valid and one not.\nIf $40a^2 - 144 = 0$, then $10a^2 = 36$, so $a^2 = \\frac{36}{10} = \\frac{18}{5}$. Then $a = \\pm \\sqrt{\\frac{18}{5}}$.\nIf $a = \\sqrt{\\frac{18}{5}}$, then $x = \\frac{-\\sqrt{\\frac{18}{5}}}{(\\sqrt{\\frac{18}{5}})^2 - 4} = \\frac{-\\sqrt{\\frac{18}{5}}}{\\frac{18}{5} - 4} = \\frac{-\\sqrt{\\frac{18}{5}}}{\\frac{18-20}{5}} = \\frac{-\\sqrt{\\frac{18}{5}}}{-\\frac{2}{5}} = \\frac{5}{2} \\sqrt{\\frac{18}{5}} = \\frac{5}{2} \\frac{3\\sqrt{2}}{\\sqrt{5}} = \\frac{15\\sqrt{2}}{2\\sqrt{5}} = \\frac{15\\sqrt{10}}{10} = \\frac{3\\sqrt{10}}{2}$.\nWe need to check if $ax \\geq 2$, i.e., $\\sqrt{\\frac{18}{5}} \\cdot \\frac{3\\sqrt{10}}{2} = \\frac{3\\sqrt{180}}{2} = \\frac{3\\sqrt{36 \\cdot 5}}{2} = \\frac{3 \\cdot 6 \\sqrt{5}}{2} = 9\\sqrt{5} \\geq 2$, which is true.\nIf $a = -\\sqrt{\\frac{18}{5}}$, then $x = \\frac{-(-\\sqrt{\\frac{18}{5}})}{(-\\sqrt{\\frac{18}{5}})^2 - 4} = \\frac{\\sqrt{\\frac{18}{5}}}{\\frac{18}{5} - 4} = \\frac{\\sqrt{\\frac{18}{5}}}{-\\frac{2}{5}} = -\\frac{5}{2} \\sqrt{\\frac{18}{5}} = -\\frac{15\\sqrt{2}}{2\\sqrt{5}} = -\\frac{15\\sqrt{10}}{10} = -\\frac{3\\sqrt{10}}{2}$.\nWe need to check if $ax \\geq 2$, i.e., $-\\sqrt{\\frac{18}{5}} \\cdot (-\\frac{3\\sqrt{10}}{2}) = \\frac{3\\sqrt{180}}{2} = \\frac{3\\sqrt{36 \\cdot 5}}{2} = \\frac{3 \\cdot 6 \\sqrt{5}}{2} = 9\\sqrt{5} \\geq 2$, which is true.\nHowever, we need to check if $2 \\sqrt{x^2 - ax} = ax-3$. If $x = \\frac{3\\sqrt{10}}{2}$, then $2 \\sqrt{(\\frac{3\\sqrt{10}}{2})^2 - \\sqrt{\\frac{18}{5}} \\cdot \\frac{3\\sqrt{10}}{2}} = 2 \\sqrt{\\frac{90}{4} - \\frac{54}{10}} = 2 \\sqrt{\\frac{45}{2} - \\frac{27}{5}} = 2 \\sqrt{\\frac{225-54}{10}} = 2 \\sqrt{\\frac{171}{10}} = 2 \\cdot \\frac{3\\sqrt{19}}{\\sqrt{10}} = \\frac{6\\sqrt{19}}{\\sqrt{10}}$.\n$ax-3 = \\sqrt{\\frac{18}{5}} \\cdot \\frac{3\\sqrt{10}}{2} - 3 = \\frac{3\\sqrt{180}}{2} - 3 = \\frac{3 \\cdot 6 \\sqrt{5}}{2} - 3 = 9\\sqrt{5} - 3$.\nIf $a^2 - 4 = 0$, then $a = \\pm 2$. If $a=2$, then $2 \\sqrt{x^2 - 2x} - |2x-2| + 1 = 0$.\nIf $x \\geq 1$, then $2 \\sqrt{x^2 - 2x} - (2x-2) + 1 = 0$, so $2 \\sqrt{x^2 - 2x} = 2x-3$.\nIf $2x-3 \\geq 0$, then $x \\geq \\frac{3}{2}$. Then $4(x^2 - 2x) = 4x^2 - 12x + 9$, so $4x^2 - 8x - 3 = 0$.\n$x = \\frac{8 \\pm \\sqrt{64 - 4(4)(-3)}}{8} = \\frac{8 \\pm \\sqrt{64+48}}{8} = \\frac{8 \\pm \\sqrt{112}}{8} = \\frac{8 \\pm 4\\sqrt{7}}{8} = 1 \\pm \\frac{\\sqrt{7}}{2}$.\nSince $x \\geq \\frac{3}{2}$, we have $x = 1 + \\frac{\\sqrt{7}}{2} \\approx 1 + \\frac{2.65}{2} = 1 + 1.325 = 2.325$.\nIf $x < 1$, then $2 \\sqrt{x^2 - 2x} - (2x-2) + 1 = 0$, so $2 \\sqrt{x^2 - 2x} = 2x-3$.\nSince $2x-3 < 0$, we have $x < \\frac{3}{2}$. Then $4(x^2 - 2x) = 4x^2 - 8x + 9$, so $4x^2 - 8x + 5 = 0$.\n$x = \\frac{8 \\pm \\sqrt{64 - 4(4)(5)}}{8} = \\frac{8 \\pm \\sqrt{64-80}}{8}$, which is not real.\n\nFinal Answer: The final answer is $\\boxed{(-\\infty,0] \\cup \\{2\\}}$"], "generated_answers": ["(-\\infty,0] \\cup \\{2\\}"], "gold_answer": "(-\\sqrt{3},-1) \\cup (1, \\sqrt{3})", "is_correct": false, "answers_correctness": [false]}

We have $f(0) = e^0 + \\ln(0+1) = 1 + 0 = 1$.\nFor $x$ close to 0 from the left, we have $f(x) = -x^2 - 2ax - a$. As $x \\to 0^-$, $f(x) \\to -a$.\nFor $x$ close to 0 from the right, we have $f(x) = e^x + \\ln(x+1)$. As $x \\to 0^+$, $f(x) \\to 1 + 0 = 1$.\nWe need $f(x)$ to be monotonic increasing, so we need $f'(x) \\geq 0$ for all $x \\in \\mathbb{R}$.\nWe have $f'(x) = -2(x+a)$ for $x < 0$ and $f'(x) = e^x + \\frac{1}{x+1}$ for $x \\geq 0$.\nWe need $-2(x+a) \\geq 0$ for $x < 0$, which means $x+a \\leq 0$, so $x \\leq -a$.\nWe also need $e^x + \\frac{1}{x+1} \\geq 0$ for $x \\geq 0$, which is always true since $e^x \\geq 1$ and $x+1 \\geq 1$.\nWe need to ensure that $f'(x)$ is continuous at $x=0$. We have $\\lim_{x \\to 0^-} f'(x) = -2a$ and $\\lim_{x \\to 0^+} f'(x) = 2$.\nWe need $\\lim_{x \\to 0^-} f'(x) \\geq 0$, so $-2a \\geq 0$, which means $a \\leq 0$.\nWe also need $\\lim_{x \\to 0^+} f'(x) \\geq 0$, so $2 \\geq 0$, which is always true.\nIf $a=0$, then $\\lim_{x \\to 0^-} f'(x) = 0$ and $\\lim_{x \\to 0^+} f'(x) = 2$. In this case, $f'(x) \\geq 0$ for all $x \\in \\mathbb{R}$.\nIf $a < 0$, then $\\lim_{x \\to 0^-} f'(x) = -2a > 0$. Also, $\\lim_{x \\to 0^+} f'(x) = 2 > 0$.\nIf $a > 0$, then $\\lim_{x \\to 0^-} f'(x) = -2a < 0$, so $f'(x) < 0$ for some $x < 0$.\nThus, we need $a \\leq 0$.\n\nWe also need $f(0^-) \\leq f(0^+)$, so $-a \\leq 1$, which means $a \\geq -1$.\nTherefore, we have $-1 \\leq a \\leq 0$.\n\nFinal Answer: The final answer is $\\boxed{[-1,0]}$"], "generated_answers": ["[-1,0]"], "gold_answer": "[-1,0]", "is_correct": true, "answers_correctness": [true]}
