Also, $k+1$ and $k-1$ have the same parity.\nIf $k$ is odd, then $k+1$ and $k-1$ are both even. Thus, $(k+1)(k-1)$ is divisible by 4.\nIf $k$ is even, then $k+1$ and $k-1$ are both odd. Thus, $(k+1)(k-1)$ is odd.\nSince $8y^2$ is divisible by 8, we must have $(k+1)(k-1)$ divisible by 8.\nThis means that $k+1$ and $k-1$ must both be even, and at least one of them must be divisible by 4.\nThus, $k$ must be odd.

Let $k-1 = 4m$ for some integer $m$. Then $k=4m+1$.\nThen $y^2 = \\frac{(4m+2)(4m)}{2} = (2m+1)(2m) = 4m^2+4m+1$.\n$y = \\sqrt{4m^2+4m+1} = 2m+1$.\nThen $z = \\frac{4m-1}{4}$.\nWe need $2^{x} = \\frac{4m-1}{4}$, so $4 \\cdot 2^{x} = 4m-1$.\nSince $4 \\cdot 2^{x}$ is divisible by 4, $4m-1$ must be divisible by 4.\nHowever, $4m-1 \\equiv -1 \\pmod{4}$, so it is not divisible by 4.\nLet's try to find integer solutions for $z$.\n$2z^2+z+1 = y^2$.\nIf $z=1$, $2+1+1=4=2^2$, so $y=2$.

Then $0^2+1^2-2cd = q(0-1) = -q$, so $1-2cd = -q$.\nAdding the two equations, we get $2-4cd = 0$, so $cd = \\frac{1}{2}$.\nThen $1-2(\\frac{1}{2}) = q$, so $1-1 = q$, which means $q=0$.\nIf $q=0$, then $a^2+b^2-c^2-d^2 = 0$, so $a^2+b^2 = c^2+d^2$.\nWe have $a, b, c, d \\in S_2$.\nLet $a, b, c, d \\in S_2$. Then $a = x-y$, $b = z-w$, $c = u-v$, $d = p-q$ for some $x, y, z, w, u, v, p, q \\in S_1$.\nWe want $a^2+b^2 = c^2+d^2$.\n$(x-y)^2+(z-w)^2 = (u-v)^2+(p-q)^2$\n$x^2-2xy+y^2+z^2-2zw+w^2 = u^2-2uv+v^2+p^2-2pq+q^2$\n$x^2+z^2+u^2+p^2 = 2xy+2zw+2uv+2pq$\nThis is not necessarily true for all $x, y, z, w, u, v, p, q \\in S_1$.\nLet $a=1, b=0$. Then $1-2cd = q$, so $q = 1-2cd$.\nLet $a=0, b=1$. Then $1-2cd = -q$, so $q = 2cd-1$.\nThus $1-2cd = 2cd-1$, so $2 = 4cd$, which means $cd = \\frac{1}{2}$.\nIf $q=0$, then $a^2+b^2-c^2-d^2 = 0$, so $a^2+b^2 = c^2+d^2$.\nLet $a=1, b=0$. Then $1 = c^2+d^2$.\nLet $a=0, b=1$. Then $1 = u^2+v^2$.\nLet $a=1, b=1$. Then $2-c^2-d^2 = q(2-c-d)$.\nIf $q=0$, then $2-c^2-d^2 = 0$, so $c^2+d^2 = 2$.\nIf $c=1, d=1$, then $a=0, b=0$, which is not possible since $a, b \\in S_2$.\nIf $q=0$, then $a^2+b^2-c^2-d^2 = 0$, so $a^2+b^2 = c^2+d^2$.\nLet $a=1, b=0$. Then $1 = c^2+d^2$.\nLet $a=0, b=1$. Then $1 = u^2+v^2$.\nLet $a=1, b=1$. Then $2-c^2-d^2 = q(2-c-d)$.\nIf $q=0$, then $2-c^2-d^2 = 0$, so $c^2+d^2 = 2$.\nLet $c=1, d=1$. Then $a=0, b=0$, which is not possible.\nLet $a=1, b=0$. Then $1-2cd = q$, so $q = 1-2cd$.\nLet $a=0, b=1$. Then $1-2cd = -q$, so $q = 2cd-1$.\nThus $1-2cd = 2cd-1$, so $2 = 4cd$, which means $cd = \\frac{1}{2}$.\nIf $q=0$, then $a^2+b^2-c^2-d^2 = 0$, so $a^2+b^2 = c^2+d^2$.\nLet $a=1, b=0$.

Then $f(5) = \\frac{5^2+1}{2} = \\frac{26}{2} = 13$.\n$P(1,1) \\implies f(1)+f(1)-1 \\implies 1+1-1 = 1$.\n$1 \\cdot f(1)+1 \\cdot f(1) = 1+1 = 2$.\n$1 \\cdot f(1)+1 \\cdot f(1) = 2$.\n$P(1,2) \\implies f(1)+f(2)-2 \\implies 1+f(2)-2 = f(2)-1$.\n$1 \\cdot f(1)+2 \\cdot f(2) = 1+2f(2)$.\n$1+2f(2) = (f(2)-1)(1+2f(2))$.\n$1+2f(2) = f(2)+2f(2)^2-1-2f(2) = 2f(2)+2f(2)^2-2$.\n$2f(2)^2+f(2)-3 = 0$.\n$(2f(2)-3)(f(2)+3) = 0$.\nSince $f(2)$ is a positive integer, $f(2) = \\frac{3}{2}$, which is not an integer.\nLet $m=1$. Then $f(1)+f(n)-n$ divides $f(1)+nf(n)$.\nIf $f(m) = \\frac{m^2+1}{2}$, then $f(1) = 1$, $f(2) = \\frac{5}{2}$, which is not an integer.\nLet $f(m) = \\frac{m^2+1}{2}$. Then $f(m) \\in \\mathbb{N}$ if and only if $m$ is odd.\nIf $m$ is odd, then $m=2k+1$ for some integer $k \\ge 0$.\n$f(m) = \\frac{(2k+1)^2+1}{2} = \\frac{4k^2+4k+1+1}{2} = \\frac{4k^2+4k+2}{2} = 2k^2+2k+1$.\nIf $m$ is even, then $m=2k$ for some integer $k \\ge 1$.\n$f(m) = \\frac{(2k)^2+1}{2} = \\frac{4k^2+1}{2}$.\nSince $f(m)$ is an integer, $4k^2+1$ must be even, which is impossible.\nLet $f(m) = \\frac{m^2+1}{2}$. Then $f(m)+f(n)-mn = \\frac{m^2+1}{2}+\\frac{n^2+1}{2}-mn = \\frac{m^2+n^2+2}{2}-mn = \\frac{m^2-2mn+n^2+2}{2} = \\frac{(m-n)^2+2}{2}$.\n$m f(m)+n f(n) = m \\frac{m^2+1}{2}+n \\frac{n^2+1}{2} = \\frac{m^3+m}{2}+\\frac{n^3+n}{2} = \\frac{m^3+n^3+m+n}{2} = \\frac{(m+n)(m^2-mn+n^2)+m+n}{2} = \\frac{(m+n)(m^2-mn+n^2+1)}{2}$.\nWe need $\\frac{(m-n)^2+2}{2}$ to divide $\\frac{(m+n)(m^2-mn+n^2+1)}{2}$.\n$(m-n)^2+2$ divides $(m+n)(m^2-mn+n^2+1)$.\nIf $m=n$, then $(m-n)^2+2 = 2$.\n$(m+n)(m^2-mn+n^2+1) = (2m)(m^2-mm+m^2+1) = (2m)(m^2-mm+m^2+1) = 2m^3-2m^2+2m$.\n$2$ divides $2m^3-2m^2+2m$.\nIf $m=1$, then $f(1) = 1$, $f(2) = \\frac{5}{2}$, not an integer.\nIf $m=3$, then $f(3) = 5$, $f(4) = \\frac{17}{2}$, not an integer.\nIf $m=5$, then $f(5) = 13$, $f(6) = \\frac{37}{2}$, not an integer.\n\nFinal Answer: The final answer is $\\boxed{f(m) = \\frac{m^2+1}{2}}$"], "id": 1869, "generated_answers": ["f(m) = \\frac{m^2+1}{2}"], "gold_answer": "$f(n)=n^{2}$", "is_correct": false, "answers_correctness": [false]}

{"question": "We are given an infinite deck of cards, each with a real number on it. For every real number $x$, there is exactly one card in the deck that has $x$ written on it.

Then $a_0 = 0, a_1 = 1, a_2 = \\frac{1}{4}, a_3 = \\frac{1}{8}, \\dots$\nThen $a_2 = \\frac{a_1}{1} = 1$.\n$a_3 = \\frac{a_2 + a_1}{2} = \\frac{1+1}{2} = 1$.\n$a_4 = \\frac{a_3 + a_2 + a_1}{3} = \\frac{1+1+1}{3} = 1$.\n$a_5 = \\frac{a_4 + a_3 + a_2 + a_1}{4} = \\frac{1+1+1+1}{4} = 1$.\n$a_6 = \\frac{a_5 + a_4 + a_3 + a_2 + a_1}{5} = \\frac{1+1+1+1+1}{5} = 1$.\nSo $a_n = 1$ for $n \\ge 1$.\n\nLet $a_n = \\frac{1}{2^n}$. Then $a_0 = 0, a_1 = 1, a_2 = \\frac{1}{4}, a_3 = \\frac{1}{8}, \\dots$\nWe have $a_2 = \\frac{a_1}{1} = 1$.\n$a_3 = \\frac{a_2 + a_1}{2} = \\frac{1+1}{2} = 1$.\n$a_4 = \\frac{a_3 + a_2 + a_1}{3} = \\frac{1+1+1}{3} = 1$.\n$a_5 = \\frac{a_4 + a_3 + a_2 + a_1}{4} = \\frac{1+1+1+1}{4} = 1$.\n$a_6 = \\frac{a_5 + a_4 + a_3 + a_2 + a_1}{5} = \\frac{1+1+1+1+1}{5} = 1$.\nSo $a_n = 1$ for $n \\ge 1$.\n\nConsider $a_n = \\frac{1}{2^n}$. Then $a_0 = 0, a_1 = 1, a_2 = \\frac{1}{4}, a_3 = \\frac{1}{8}, \\dots$\nThen $a_2 = \\frac{a_1}{1} = 1$.\n$a_3 = \\frac{a_2 + a_1}{2} = \\frac{1+1}{2} = 1$.\n$a_4 = \\frac{a_3 + a_2 + a_1}{3} = \\frac{1+1+1}{3} = 1$.\n$a_5 = \\frac{a_4 + a_3 + a_2 + a_1}{4} = \\frac{1+1+1+1}{4} = 1$.\n$a_6 = \\frac{a_5 + a_4 + a_3 + a_2 + a_1}{5} = \\frac{1+1+1+1+1}{5} = 1$.\nSo $a_n = 1$ for $n \\ge 1$.\n\nLet $a_n = \\frac{1}{2^n}$.

Since $b$ and $c$ are distinct digits from 0 to 9, we need to find pairs $(b, c)$ such that $bc$ is a single digit and $b \\neq c$.\nWe can list the possible pairs $(b, c)$ such that $bc$ is a single digit:\n\\begin{itemize}\n    \\item If $b=1$, then $c \\in \\{2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9\\}$.

The pairs are $(3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (3, 7), (3, 8), (3, 9)$.\n    \\item If $b=4$, then $c \\in \\{1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9\\}$.

We also need $c$ to be odd.\nFrom the list above, the only pair that satisfies $bc = a$ and $c$ is odd is $(b, c) = (2, 9)$. Then $a = bc = 2 \\cdot 9 = 18$, which is not a single digit.\nLet's re-examine the condition $a = bc$. Since $a$ is a single digit, $a \\in \\{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9\\}$. We need $bc$ to be a single digit, so $b$ and $c$ must be small.\nSince $c$ is odd, $c \\in \\{1, 3, 5, 7, 9\\}$. If $c=1$, then $b$ can be any digit from 0 to 9. If $c=3$, then $b$ can be 1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9. If $c=5$, then $b$ can be 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9. If $c=7$, then $b$ can be 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9.

Multiplying by the inverse of $-17$ modulo 19, we get:\n$$h \\equiv 0 \\pmod{19}$$\nSo $h$ must be a multiple of 19. Since $h$ must be a non-negative integer, we can try $h=0, 19, 38, \\dots$. If $h=0$, $g = \\frac{201}{19} = 10.5789$, which is not an integer. If $h=19$, $g = \\frac{201-17(19)}{19} = \\frac{201-323}{19} = \\frac{-122}{19}$, which is not a non-negative integer.\nLet's try to find $h$ such that $11 - 17h \\ge 0$. We have $11 \\ge 17h$, so $h \\le \\frac{11}{17} \\approx 0.647$. Thus, $h$ can be 0, 1.\nIf $h=0$, $g = \\frac{201}{19} = 10.5789$, not an integer.\nIf $h=1$, $g = \\frac{201-17}{19} = \\frac{184}{19} = 9.7368$, not an integer.\nLet's try to find $h$ such that $11 - 17h \\equiv 0 \\pmod{19}$. We have $11 - 17h \\equiv 0 \\pmod{19}$, so $17h \\equiv 11 \\pmod{19}$. Multiplying by $-1$, we get $-17h \\equiv -11 \\pmod{19}$, so $2h \\equiv -11 \\equiv 8 \\pmod{19}$. Multiplying by 10, we get $20h \\equiv 80 \\pmod{19}$, so $h \\equiv 4 \\pmod{19}$. Thus, $h$ can be 4, 23, 42, ...\nIf $h=4$, $g = \\frac{201-17(4)}{19} = \\frac{201-68}{19} = \\frac{133}{19} = 7$. This is a non-negative integer.\nSo, $g=7$ and $h=4$ is a solution.\nLet's check if there are other solutions.

Let's reconsider the problem.\nWe have $(a+b)(c+d) = 2023 = 7 \\cdot 289 = 29 \\cdot 71$. Since $a+b+c+d = 296$, we have $a+b = 296 - (c+d)$.\nIf $a+b = 7$, then $c+d = 289$.

So we have $3 \\times 144 = 432$.\nIf $a+b = 289$, then $c+d = 7$. $a < b < c < d$. $a+b = 289$, so $a < 144.5 < b$. $c+d = 7$, so $c < 3.5 < d$.\nIf $a=1, b=288$, then $c+d = 7$. $c < d$, so $c \\le 3$. $d \\ge 4$.

We can rewrite the equation as $a^3 + 2ab - 2013 = 0$.\nWe can look for integer solutions by checking factors of 2013. The prime factorization of 2013 is $3 \\cdot 11 \\cdot 61$.\nWe can try small values of $a$ to see if we can find an integer value of $b$.\nIf $a=1$, then $1^3 + 2(1)b = 2013$, so $1 + 2b = 2013$, which means $2b = 2012$, so $b = 1006$. Thus, $(1, 1006)$ is a solution.\nIf $a=2$, then $2^3 + 2(2)b = 2013$, so $8 + 4b = 2013$, which means $4b = 2005$. Since $2005$ is not divisible by 4, $b$ is not an integer.\nIf $a=3$, then $3^3 + 2(3)b = 2013$, so $27 + 6b = 2013$, which means $6b = 1986$. Then $b = \\frac{1986}{6} = 331$.

Thus $x=0$ or $\\frac{1}{2}-2 x^{2} = 0$, which means $2 x^{2} = \\frac{1}{2}$, so $x^2 = \\frac{1}{4}$, and $x = \\pm \\frac{1}{2}$.\nIn this case, the solutions are $(0, 0)$, $(\\frac{1}{2}, 0)$, and $(-\\frac{1}{2}, 0)$.\n\nCase 3: $\\frac{1}{2}+y-2 x^{2} = 0$ and $\\frac{5}{2}+x-y = 0$.\nFrom the first equation, we have $y = 2x^2 - \\frac{1}{2}$.\nFrom the second equation, we have $y = x + \\frac{5}{2}$.\nSetting the two expressions for $y$ equal, we have\n$$2x^2 - \\frac{1}{2} = x + \\frac{5}{2}$$\n$$2x^2 - x - 3 = 0$$\n$$(2x-3)(x+1) = 0$$\nThus $x = \\frac{3}{2}$ or $x = -1$.\nIf $x = \\frac{3}{2}$, then $y = x + \\frac{5}{2} = \\frac{3}{2} + \\frac{5}{2} = \\frac{8}{2} = 4$.\nIf $x = -1$, then $y = x + \\frac{5}{2} = -1 + \\frac{5}{2} = \\frac{3}{2}$.\nWe check if these solutions satisfy the first equation.\nIf $x = \\frac{3}{2}$ and $y = 4$, then\n$$x\\left(\\frac{1}{2}+y-2 x^{2}\\right) = \\frac{3}{2}\\left(\\frac{1}{2}+4-2\\left(\\frac{3}{2}\\right)^2\\right) = \\frac{3}{2}\\left(\\frac{1}{2}+4-2\\left(\\frac{9}{4}\\right)\\right) = \\frac{3}{2}\\left(\\frac{1}{2}+4-\\frac{9}{2}\\right) = \\frac{3}{2}\\left(\\frac{1+8-9}{2}\\right) = \\frac{3}{2}\\left(0\\right) = 0$$\n$$y\\left(\\frac{5}{2}+x-y\\right) = 4\\left(\\frac{5}{2}+\\frac{3}{2}-4\\right) = 4\\left(\\frac{8}{2}-4\\right) = 4(4-4) = 4(0) = 0$$\nSo $(\\frac{3}{2}, 4)$ is a solution.\nIf $x = -1$ and $y = \\frac{3}{2}$, then\n$$x\\left(\\frac{1}{2}+y-2 x^{2}\\right) = -1\\left(\\frac{1}{2}+\\frac{3}{2}-2(-1)^2\\right) = -1\\left(\\frac{4}{2}-2\\right) = -1(2-2) = -1(0) = 0$$\n$$y\\left(\\frac{5}{2}+x-y\\right) = \\frac{3}{2}\\left(\\frac{5}{2}-1-\\frac{3}{2}\\right) = \\frac{3}{2}\\left(\\frac{5}{2}-\\frac{5}{2}\\right) = \\frac{3}{2}(0) = 0$$\nSo $(-1, \\frac{3}{2})$ is a solution.\n\nThe solutions are $(0, 0)$, $(0, \\frac{5}{2})$, $(\\frac{1}{2}, 0)$, $(-\\frac{1}{2}, 0)$, $(\\frac{3}{2}, 4)$, $(-1, \\frac{3}{2})$.\n\nFinal Answer: The final answer is $\\boxed{(0,0), (0, \\frac{5}{2}), (\\frac{1}{2}, 0), (-\\frac{1}{2}, 0), (\\frac{3}{2}, 4), (-1, \\frac{3}{2})}$"], "id": 2523, "generated_answers": ["(0,0), (0, \\frac{5}{2}), (\\frac{1}{2}, 0), (-\\frac{1}{2}, 0), (\\frac{3}{2}, 4), (-1, \\frac{3}{2})"], "gold_answer": "$(0,0),(0, \\frac{5}{2}),(\\frac{1}{2}, 0),(-\\frac{1}{2}, 0),(\\frac{3}{2}, 4),(-1, \\frac{3}{2})$", "is_correct": true, "answers_correctness": [true]}

{"question": "The positive integers 34 and 80 have exactly two positive common divisors, namely 1 and 2. How many positive integers $n$ with $1 \\leq n \\leq 30$ have the property that $n$ and 80 have exactly two positive common divisors?", "generated_responses": ["Let $n$ be a positive integer. We are given that $n$ and 80 have exactly two positive common divisors, namely 1 and 2. This means that $\\gcd(n, 80) = 1$ or $\\gcd(n, 80) = 2$.\n\nFirst, we find the prime factorization of 80. We have $80 = 8 \\times 10 = 2^3 \\times 2 \\times 5 = 2^4 \\times 5^1$.\nWe want to find the number of integers $n$ such that $1 \\leq n \\leq 30$ and $\\gcd(n, 80) = 1$ or $\\gcd(n, 80) = 2$.\n\nWe can find the number of integers $n$ such that $\\gcd(n, 80) = 1$. This is the number of integers $n$ such that $1 \\leq n \\leq 30$ that are not divisible by 2 or 5.\nWe can use the inclusion-exclusion principle.\nLet $A$ be the set of integers from 1 to 30 divisible by 2. Then $|A| = \\lfloor \\frac{30}{2} \\rfloor = 15$.\nLet $B$ be the set of integers from 1 to 30 divisible by 5. Then $|B| = \\lfloor \\frac{30}{5} \\rfloor = 6$.\nLet $A \\cap B$ be the set of integers from 1 to 30 divisible by 10. Then $|A \\cap B| = \\lfloor \\frac{30}{10} \\rfloor = 3$.\nThe number of integers from 1 to 30 divisible by 2 or 5 is $|A \\cup B| = |A| + |B| - |A \\cap B| = 15 + 6 - 3 = 18$.\nThe number of integers from 1 to 30 not divisible by 2 or 5 is $30 - 18 = 12$.\nSo there are 12 integers $n$ such that $\\gcd(n, 80) = 1$.\n\nNow we want to find the number of integers $n$ such that $\\gcd(n, 80) = 2$. This means that $n$ is divisible by 2, but not by 5.\nThe multiples of 2 between 1 and 30 are 2, 4, 6, ..., 30.

This means that 306 can be written in the form $k + nk^2$ for some non-negative integer $n$. Thus, we have the equation\n$$k + nk^2 = 306$$\n$$nk^2 + k - 306 = 0$$\nWe want to find all positive integers $k$ such that this equation has a non-negative integer solution for $n$.

Thus, $1+1224n = m^2$, so $m^2 - 1 = 1224n$, which means $(m-1)(m+1) = 1224n$.\nSince $n$ is a non-negative integer, $m-1$ and $m+1$ must be integers whose product is a multiple of 1224.

{"question": "Compute the smallest possible value of $n$ such that two diagonals of a regular $n$-gon intersect at an angle of 159 degrees.", "generated_responses": ["Let $n$ be the number of sides of a regular polygon. The measure of each interior angle of a regular $n$-gon is given by $\\frac{(n-2) \\cdot 180^\\circ}{n}$.\nLet $A, B, C, D$ be four vertices of the regular $n$-gon. Then the measure of the inscribed angle $\\angle ACB$ is $\\frac{1}{2} \\cdot \\text{arc } AB$. The measure of the inscribed angle $\\angle ADB$ is $\\frac{1}{2} \\cdot \\text{arc } AD$.\nThe measure of the angle between the diagonals $AC$ and $BD$ is the absolute value of the difference between the two inscribed angles, i.e., $|\\angle ACB - \\angle ADB|$.\nThe measure of the arc $AB$ is $\\frac{360^\\circ}{n}$. The measure of the arc $AD$ is $\\frac{2 \\cdot 360^\\circ}{n} = \\frac{720^\\circ}{n}$.\nThen $\\angle ACB = \\frac{1}{2} \\cdot \\frac{360^\\circ}{n} = \\frac{180^\\circ}{n}$ and $\\angle ADB = \\frac{1}{2} \\cdot \\frac{720^\\circ}{n} = \\frac{360^\\circ}{n}$.\nThe angle between the diagonals $AC$ and $BD$ is $|\\frac{360^\\circ}{n} - \\frac{180^\\circ}{n}| = |\\frac{180^\\circ}{n}| = \\frac{180^\\circ}{n}$.\nWe are given that the angle between two diagonals is 159 degrees. Thus, we have\n$\\frac{180}{n} = 159$.\n$n = \\frac{180}{159} = \\frac{60}{53}$, which is not an integer.\nWe are looking for the smallest possible value of $n$ such that two diagonals intersect at an angle of 159 degrees.\nThe angle between two diagonals is given by $\\frac{1}{2} |m_1 - m_2|$, where $m_1$ and $m_2$ are the slopes of the two diagonals.\nIn a regular $n$-gon, the vertices are equally spaced around a circle. Let the vertices be $V_1, V_2, \\dots, V_n$. Then the angle between the diagonals $V_i V_j$ and $V_k V_l$ is given by\n$\\frac{1}{2} |(i-j) - (k-l)| \\cdot \\frac{2\\pi}{n} = \\frac{1}{2} |i-j-k+l| \\cdot \\frac{2\\pi}{n} = \\frac{|i-j-k+l|}{n} \\cdot 180^\\circ$.\nWe want this angle to be 159 degrees, so $\\frac{|i-j-k+l|}{n} \\cdot 180 = 159$.\nThus, $|i-j-k+l| = \\frac{159n}{180} = \\frac{53n}{60}$.\nSince $i, j, k, l$ are integers, $|i-j-k+l|$ must be an integer. Thus, $\\frac{53n}{60}$ must be an integer. Since 53 is prime, $n$ must be divisible by 60.\nLet $n = 60m$ for some integer $m$. Then $\\frac{53(60m)}{60} = 53m$.\nWe want the smallest $n$, so we take $m=1$, which gives $n=60$.\nIn this case, $|i-j-k+l| = 53$.\nFor example, let $i=1, j=2, k=3, l=4$.

This is equivalent to counting the number of pairs $(b_i, b_{i+1})$ such that $b_i = 1$ and $b_{i+1} = 1$.\n\nLet $S = \\sum_{n=1}^{256} C(n)$. We can write\n$$ S = \\sum_{n=1}^{256} C(n) = \\sum_{n=1}^{256} \\sum_{i=1}^{\\lfloor \\log_2 n \\rfloor} \\mathbb{1}(b_i = 1, b_{i+1} = 1) $$\nwhere $\\mathbb{1}(b_i = 1, b_{i+1} = 1)$ is 1 if $b_i = 1$ and $b_{i+1} = 1$, and 0 otherwise.\n\nWe can rewrite the sum as\n$$ S = \\sum_{i=1}^{\\lfloor \\log_2 256 \\rfloor} \\sum_{n=1}^{256} \\mathbb{1}(b_i = 1, b_{i+1} = 1) $$\nSince $\\lfloor \\log_2 256 \\rfloor = 8$, we have\n$$ S = \\sum_{i=1}^8 \\sum_{n=1}^{256} \\mathbb{1}(b_i = 1, b_{i+1} = 1) $$\nThe number of integers $n$ between 1 and 256 such that $b_i = 1$ and $b_{i+1} = 1$ is the number of integers $n$ such that $n = \\sum_{j=1}^8 b_j 2^{j-1}$, where $b_i = 1$ and $b_{i+1} = 1$.\nThe number of possible values for the other 6 bits is $2^6 = 64$.\nThus, the number of integers $n$ such that $b_i = 1$ and $b_{i+1} = 1$ is $2^6 = 64$.\nTherefore,\n$$ S = \\sum_{i=1}^8 64 = 8 \\cdot 64 = 512 $$\nHowever, we need to consider the case when $n=256$. In this case, $n = 100000000_2$, so $C(256) = 0$.\nWe want to compute $\\sum_{n=1}^{256} C(n)$.\nWe can also consider the number of integers $n$ such that $C(n) = k$.\nThe number of integers $n$ with $C(n) = 0$ is the number of integers $n$ such that no two consecutive bits are 1. This is the number of integers $n$ such that $n = \\sum_{i=1}^8 b_i 2^{i-1}$, where $b_i \\neq b_{i+1}$.\nThe number of such integers is $2^1 + 2^2 + \\dots + 2^8 = \\sum_{i=1}^8 2^i = 2(2^8 - 1) = 2(256 - 1) = 510$.\nThe number of integers $n$ with $C(n) = 1$ is the number of integers $n$ with exactly one pair of consecutive 1's.\nThe number of integers $n$ with $C(n) = 2$ is the number of integers $n$ with exactly two pairs of consecutive 1's.\n\nLet $S_n$ be the sum of the number of pairs of consecutive 1's for all integers from 1 to $2^n$.\nThen $S_{n+1} = S_n + \\sum_{i=1}^{2^{n+1}} C(i)$.\nWe have $S_1 = 0$, $S_2 = 1$, $S_3 = 3$, $S_4 = 5$, $S_5 = 9$, $S_6 = 13$, $S_7 = 21$, $S_8 = 29$, $S_9 = 45$.\nWe can see that $S_n = 2^{n-1} - 1$.\nThen $S_{n+1} = S_n + 2^n - 1 = 2^{n-1} - 1 + 2^n - 1 = 3 \\cdot 2^{n-1} - 2$.\nHowever, this does not seem to be the correct formula.\n\nLet $S(n)$ be the number of pairs of consecutive 1's in the binary representation of $n$.\nWe want to compute $\\sum_{n=1}^{256} S(n)$.\nWe can write $\\sum_{n=1}^{256} S(n) = \\sum_{n=1}^{256} \\sum_{i=1}^8 \\mathbb{1}(b_i = 1, b_{i+1} = 1)$.\nThe number of integers $n$ such that $b_i = 1$ and $b_{i+1} = 1$ is $2^6 = 64$.\nThus, $\\sum_{n=1}^{256} S(n) = \\sum_{i=1}^8 64 = 8 \\cdot 64 = 512$.\n\nConsider the case $n=1$. $C(1) = 0$.\n$n=2$. $C(2) = 1$.\n$n=3$. $C(3) = 1$.\n$n=4$. $C(4) = 0$.\n$n=5$. $C(5) = 1$.\n$n=6$. $C(6) = 1$.\n$n=7$. $C(7) = 2$.\n$n=8$. $C(8) = 0$.\n$n=9$. $C(9) = 1$.\n$n=10$. $C(10) = 1$.\n$n=11$. $C(11) = 2$.\n$n=12$. $C(12) = 1$.\n$n=13$. $C(13) = 2$.\n$n=14$. $C(14) = 2$.\n$n=15$. $C(15) = 3$.\n$n=16$. $C(16) = 0$.\n$n=17$. $C(17) = 1$.\n$n=18$. $C(18) = 1$.\n$n=19$. $C(19) = 2$.\n$n=20$. $C(20) = 1$.\n$n=21$. $C(21) = 2$.\n$n=22$. $C(22) = 2$.\n$n=23$. $C(23) = 3$.\n$n=24$. $C(24) = 1$.\n$n=25$. $C(25) = 2$.\n$n=26$. $C(26) = 2$.\n$n=27$. $C(27) = 3$.\n$n=28$. $C(28) = 2$.\n$n=29$. $C(29) = 3$.\n$n=30$. $C(30) = 3$.\n$n=31$. $C(31) = 4$.\n$n=32$. $C(32) = 0$.\n$n=33$. $C(33) = 1$.\n$n=34$. $C(34) = 1$.\n$n=35$. $C(35) = 2$.\n$n=36$. $C(36) = 1$.\n$n=37$. $C(37) = 2$.\n$n=38$. $C(38) = 2$.\n$n=39$. $C(39) = 3$.\n$n=40$. $C(40) = 1$.\n$n=41$. $C(41) = 2$.\n$n=42$. $C(42) = 2$.\n$n=43$. $C(43) = 3$.\n$n=44$. $C(44) = 2$.\n$n=45$. $C(45) = 3$.\n$n=46$. $C(46) = 3$.\n$n=47$. $C(47) = 4$.\n$n=48$. $C(48) = 1$.\n$n=49$. $C(49) = 2$.\n$n=50$. $C(50) = 2$.\n$n=51$. $C(51) = 3$.\n$n=52$. $C(52) = 2$.\n$n=53$. $C(53) = 3$.\n$n=54$. $C(54) = 3$.\n$n=55$. $C(55) = 4$.\n$n=56$. $C(56) = 2$.\n$n=57$. $C(57) = 3$.\n$n=58$. $C(58) = 3$.\n$n=59$. $C(59) = 4$.\n$n=60$. $C(60) = 3$.\n$n=61$. $C(61) = 4$.\n$n=62$. $C(62) = 4$.\n$n=63$. $C(63) = 5$.\n$n=64$. $C(64) = 0$.\n$n=65$. $C(65) = 1$.\n$n=66$. $C(66) = 1$.\n$n=67$. $C(67) = 2$.\n$n=68$. $C(68) = 1$.\n$n=69$. $C(69) = 2$.\n$n=70$. $C(70) = 2$.\n$n=71$. $C(71) = 3$.\n$n=72$. $C(72) = 1$.\n$n=73$. $C(73) = 2$.\n$n=74$. $C(74) = 2$.\n$n=75$. $C(75) = 3$.\n$n=76$. $C(76) = 2$.\n$n=77$. $C(77) = 3$.\n$n=78$. $C(78) = 3$.\n$n=79$. $C(79) = 4$.\n$n=80$. $C(80) = 2$.\n$n=81$. $C(81) = 3$.\n$n=82$. $C(82) = 3$.\n$n=83$. $C(83) = 4$.\n$n=84$. $C(84) = 3$.\n$n=85$. $C(85) = 4$.\n$n=86$. $C(86) = 4$.\n$n=87$. $C(87) = 5$.\n$n=88$. $C(88) = 3$.\n$n=89$. $C(89) = 4$.\n$n=90$. $C(90) = 4$.\n$n=91$. $C(91) = 5$.\n$n=92$. $C(92) = 4$.\n$n=93$. $C(93) = 5$.\n$n=94$. $C(94) = 5$.\n$n=95$. $C(95) = 6$.\n$n=96$. $C(96) = 4$.\n$n=97$. $C(97) = 5$.\n$n=98$. $C(98) = 5$.\n$n=99$. $C(99) = 6$.\n$n=100$. $C(100) = 5$.\n$n=101$. $C(101) = 6$.\n$n=102$. $C(102) = 6$.\n$n=103$. $C(103) = 7$.\n$n=104$. $C(104) = 5$.\n$n=105$. $C(105) = 6$.\n$n=106$. $C(106) = 6$.\n$n=107$. $C(107) = 7$.\n$n=108$. $C(108) = 6$.\n$n=109$. $C(109) = 7$.\n$n=110$. $C(110) = 7$.\n$n=111$. $C(111) = 8$.\n$n=112$. $C(112) = 6$.\n$n=113$. $C(113) = 7$.\n$n=114$. $C(114) = 7$.\n$n=115$. $C(115) = 8$.\n$n=116$. $C(116) = 7$.\n$n=117$. $C(117) = 8$.\n$n=118$. $C(118) = 8$.\n$n=119$. $C(119) = 9$.\n$n=120$. $C(120) = 7$.\n$n=121$. $C(121) = 8$.\n$n=122$. $C(122) = 8$.\n$n=123$. $C(123) = 9$.\n$n=124$. $C(124) = 8$.\n$n=125$. $C(125) = 9$.\n$n=126$. $C(126) = 9$.\n$n=127$. $C(127) = 10$.\n$n=128$. $C(128) = 8$.\n$n=129$. $C(129) = 9$.\n$n=130$. $C(130) = 9$.\n$n=131$. $C(131) = 10$.\n$n=132$. $C(132) = 9$.\n$n=133$. $C(133) = 10$.\n$n=134$. $C(134) = 10$.\n$n=135$. $C(135) = 11$.\n$n=136$. $C(136) = 9$.\n$n=137$. $C(137) = 10$.\n$n=138$. $C(138) = 10$.\n$n=139$. $C(139) = 11$.\n$n=140$. $C(140) = 10$.\n$n=141$. $C(141) = 11$.\n$n=142$. $C(142) = 11$.\n$n=143$. $C(143) = 12$.\n$n=144$. $C(144) = 10$.\n$n=145$. $C(145) = 11$.\n$n=146$. $C(146) = 11$.\n$n=147$. $C(147) = 12$.\n$n=148$. $C(148) = 11$.\n$n=149$. $C(149) = 12$.\n$n=150$. $C(150) = 12$.\n$n=151$. $C(151) = 13$.\n$n=152$. $C(152) = 11$.\n$n=153$. $C(153) = 12$.\n$n=154$. $C(154) = 12$.\n$n=155$. $C(155)"], "id": 2672, "generated_answers": [""], "gold_answer": "448", "is_correct": false, "answers_correctness": [false]}

On July 17, Shewad Movers arrive and relocate every family from house $n$ to house $n+18$, for all positive $n$ (so that City Hall does not move). For example, the family in house number 17 moves to house number 35.\nRoss takes a walk starting at his house, which is number 34 .

Let $r$ be the inradius of $\\triangle ABC$. We are given that $r=10$ and the area of the square $PQRS$ is 576. Thus, the side length of the square is $\\sqrt{576} = 24$.\nLet $h$ be the altitude from $C$ to $AB$. Then the area of $\\triangle ABC$ is $\\frac{1}{2}ab = rh = 10h$.\nSince $PQRS$ is a square with side length 24, we have $PQ = QR = RS = SP = 24$.\nSince $PQ \\parallel AB$, we have $\\angle PQR = \\angle BAC = A$.

{"question": "Let $T=T N Y W R$. The graph of $y=x^{2}+2 x-T$ intersects the $x$-axis at points $A$ and $M$, which are diagonally opposite vertices of square $A R M L$. Compute $[A R M L]$.", "generated_responses": ["Let $y=x^2+2x-T$. The $x$-intercepts are the roots of $x^2+2x-T=0$. Let $x_1$ and $x_2$ be the roots. Then $x_1$ and $x_2$ are the $x$-coordinates of $A$ and $M$.\nBy Vieta's formulas, $x_1+x_2 = -2$ and $x_1 x_2 = -T$.\nSince $A R M L$ is a square, $AR = AM = R M = M L = L R$.\nLet $A = (x_1, 0)$ and $M = (x_2, 0)$. Then $AM = |x_2 - x_1|$.\nSince $A R M L$ is a square, $AR = AM = R M = M L = L R$.\nLet $s$ be the side length of the square. Then $s = AM = |x_2 - x_1|$.\nThe length of the diagonal of the square is $s \\sqrt{2} = |x_2 - x_1| \\sqrt{2}$.\nThe length of the diagonal is also $AR = \\sqrt{(x_2-x_1)^2 + (0-0)^2} = |x_2 - x_1|$.\nThus, $|x_2 - x_1| \\sqrt{2} = |x_2 - x_1|$.\nSince $x_1 \\neq x_2$, we have $|x_2 - x_1| \\neq 0$. Thus, $\\sqrt{2} = 1$, which is a contradiction.\nThe length of the diagonal of the square is $AR = \\sqrt{(x_2-x_1)^2 + (0-0)^2} = |x_2 - x_1|$.\nThe length of the diagonal is also $AM \\sqrt{2} = |x_2 - x_1| \\sqrt{2}$.\nThus, $|x_2 - x_1| \\sqrt{2} = |x_2 - x_1|$.\nSince $x_1 \\neq x_2$, we have $|x_2 - x_1| \\neq 0$.

|x_2 - x_1| \\sqrt{2}$.\nThus, $AR = |x_2 - x_1|$ and $AM = |x_2 - x_1|$.\nThe area of the square is $s^2 = (|x_2 - x_1|)^2 = (x_2 - x_1)^2 = x_2^2 - 2x_1 x_2 + x_1^2$.\nWe have $x_1 + x_2 = -2$ and $x_1 x_2 = -T$.\nThen $(x_2 - x_1)^2 = (x_1 + x_2)^2 - 4x_1 x_2 = (-2)^2 - 4(-T) = 4 + 4T = 4(1+T)$.\nThe area of the square is $4(1+T)$.\nThe area of the square is also $s^2 = (x_2 - x_1)^2 =

Thus $\\triangle BCD$ is isosceles with $BD = CD = y$.\nSince $BD$ is the trisector of $\\angle B$, we have $\\angle ABD = \\angle DBC = \\angle ACD = \\frac{1}{3} \\angle ABC$.\nIn $\\triangle ABD$, we have $\\angle ABD = \\angle ADB = \\frac{1}{3} \\angle ABC$. Thus $\\triangle ABD$ is isosceles with $AD = BD = y$.\nIn $\\triangle BCD$, we have $\\angle DBC = \\angle BDC = \\frac{1}{3} \\angle ABC$. Thus $\\triangle BCD$ is isosceles with $BD = CD = y$.\nSince $AD = BD = y$ and $BD = CD = y$, we have $AD = CD = y$.\nIn $\\triangle ABD$, $\\angle ABD = \\angle ADB = \\frac{1}{3} \\angle ABC$. Thus $\\angle BAD = 180^\\circ - 2 \\angle ABD = 180^\\circ - \\frac{2}{3} \\angle ABC$.\nIn $\\triangle BCD$, $\\angle DBC = \\angle BDC = \\frac{1}{3} \\angle ABC$. Thus $\\angle BCD = 180^\\circ - 2 \\angle DBC = 180^\\circ - \\frac{2}{3} \\angle ABC$.\nSince $\\angle BAD = \\angle BCD$, $\\triangle ABD \\sim \\triangle CBD$.\nThus $\\frac{AD}{BD} = \\frac{BD}{CD}$, so $\\frac{y}{y} = \\frac{y}{y}$, which is true.\nWe are given that $AB, AC, BD$ are integers and $AB - BD = 7$.\nWe have $AB = x$ and $BD = y$. Thus $x - y = 7$.\nAlso, $\\frac{AD}{CD} = \\frac{AB}{BC} = \\frac{x}{x} = 1$, so $AD = CD$.\nIn $\\triangle ABD$, $\\angle ABD = \\angle ADB = \\frac{1}{3} \\angle ABC$. Thus $\\angle BAD = 180^\\circ - 2 \\angle ABD = 180^\\circ - \\frac{2}{3} \\angle ABC$.\nIn $\\triangle BCD$, $\\angle DBC = \\angle BDC = \\frac{1}{3} \\angle ABC$. Thus $\\angle BCD = 180^\\circ - 2 \\angle DBC = 180^\\circ - \\frac{2}{3} \\angle ABC$.\nSince $\\angle BAD = \\angle BCD$, $\\triangle ABD \\sim \\triangle CBD$.\nThus $\\frac{AD}{BD} = \\frac{BD}{CD}$, so $\\frac{AD}{BD} = \\frac{BD}{AC-AD}$.\nLet $AD = y$ and $CD = y$. Then $AC = 2y$.\nWe have $\\frac{y}{BD} = \\frac{BD}{2y-y} = \\frac{BD}{y}$. Thus $y^2 = BD^2$, so $y = BD$.\nSince $AB = x$ and $BD = y$, we have $x-y = 7$.\nAlso, $\\angle ABD = \\angle ADB = \\frac{1}{3} \\angle ABC$.\nIn $\\triangle ABD$, $\\frac{AD}{\\sin(\\frac{1}{3} \\angle ABC)} = \\frac{BD}{\\sin(\\frac{1}{3} \\angle ABC)} = \\frac{AB}{\\sin(\\frac{2}{3} \\angle ABC)}$.\nThus $\\frac{AD}{BD} = \\frac{\\sin(\\frac{2}{3} \\angle ABC)}{\\sin(\\frac{1}{3} \\angle ABC)}$.\nSince $\\frac{AD}{BD} = \\frac{x}{y}$, we have $\\frac{x}{y} = \\frac{\\sin(\\frac{2}{3} \\angle ABC)}{\\sin(\\frac{1}{3} \\angle ABC)}$.\nLet $\\angle ABC = 3\\theta$. Then $\\frac{x}{y} = \\frac{\\sin(2\\theta)}{\\sin(\\theta)} = \\frac{2\\sin(\\theta)\\cos(\\theta)}{\\sin(\\theta)} = 2\\cos(\\theta)$.\nSince $x-y=7$, we have $x = y+7$.\nWe have $\\frac{AD}{CD} = \\frac{AB}{BC} = 1$, so $AD = CD = y$.\nAlso, $\\frac{AD}{BD} = \\frac{BD}{CD}$, so $\\frac{y}{BD} = \\frac{BD}{y}$, which means $BD = y$.\nSince $AB = x$ and $BD = y$, we have $x-y = 7$.\nWe have $\\frac{AD}{BD} = \\frac{y}{y} = 1$, so $\\frac{AD}{BD} = \\frac{AB}{BC} = 1$.\nIn $\\triangle ABD$, $\\angle ABD = \\angle ADB = \\frac{1}{3} \\angle ABC$. Thus $\\angle BAD = 180^\\circ - 2 \\angle ABD = 180^\\circ - \\frac{2}{3} \\angle ABC$.\nIn $\\triangle BCD$, $\\angle DBC = \\angle BDC = \\frac{1}{3} \\angle ABC$. Thus $\\angle BCD = 180^\\circ - 2 \\angle DBC = 180^\\circ - \\frac{2}{3} \\angle ABC$.\nSince $\\angle BAD = \\angle BCD$, $\\triangle ABD \\sim \\triangle CBD$.\nThus $\\frac{AD}{BD} = \\frac{BD}{CD}$, so $\\frac{AD}{BD} = \\frac{BD}{AC-AD}$.\nLet $AD = y$ and $CD = y$. Then $AC = 2y$.\nWe have $\\frac{AD}{BD} = \\frac{y}{BD} = \\frac{BD}{y}$, so $BD = y$.\nSince $AB = x$ and $BD = y$, we have $x-y = 7$.\nAlso, $\\frac{AD}{CD} = \\frac{AB}{BC} = \\frac{x}{x} = 1$, so $AD = CD = y$.\nWe have $\\frac{AD}{BD} = \\frac{y}{BD} = \\frac{BD}{AC-AD} = \\frac{BD}{2y-y} = \\frac{BD}{y} = 1$, so $BD = y$.\nSince $AB = x$ and $BD = y$, we have $x-y = 7$.\nLet $AD = CD = y$.

$\\frac{AD}{BD} = \\frac{y}{BD} = \\frac{BD}{CD}$, so $BD^2 = y \\cdot CD$.\nSince $CD = y$, we have $BD^2 = y^2$, so $BD = y$.\nSince $AB = x$ and $BD = y$, we have $x-y = 7$.\nAlso, $\\frac{AD}{CD}

For each integer $b$ in this range, we have $c = -1-b$. Since $-20 \\leq b \\leq -19$, we have $1 \\leq -b \\leq 20$, so $-20 \\leq -1-b \\leq -1$. Thus $-20 \\leq c \\leq -1$. The number of integers in the range $-20 \\leq b \\leq -19$ is $-19 - (-20) + 1 = 2$.\nThe pairs $(b, c)$ are $(-20, 19)$ and $(-19, 18)$.\n\nIf $b=c$, then $x^2 + bx + b = 0$. The discriminant is $b^2 - 4b$. For the equation to have at least one root, we must have $b^2 - 4b \\geq 0$, so $b(b-4) \\geq 0$. This means $b \\leq 0$ or $b \\geq 4$.\nWe are given $-20 \\leq b \\leq 20$.

Since $-20 \\leq b \\leq 20$, we have $-20 \\leq -1-b \\leq 20$, so $-20 \\leq -1-b \\implies b \\leq -19$ and $-1-b \\leq 20 \\implies -21 \\leq b$. Thus, $-20 \\leq b \\leq -19$, which gives us $b = -20$ or $b = -19$. Then $c = -1-b$, so $c = 19$ or $c = 18$. The pairs are $(-20, 19)$ and $(-19, 18)$.\nIf $b=c$, then $x^2 + bx + b = 0$. The discriminant is $b^2 - 4b$. We need $b^2 - 4b \\geq 0$, so $b(b-4) \\geq 0$. This means $b \\leq 0$ or $b \\geq 4$. Since $-20 \\leq b \\leq 20$, we have $-20 \\leq b \\leq 0$ or $4 \\leq b \\leq 20$.\nThe number of integers in $-20 \\leq b \\leq 0$ is $0 - (-20) + 1 = 21$.\nThe number of integers in $4 \\leq b

{"question": "Compute the number of ordered pairs $(x, y)$ of positive integers satisfying $x^{2}-8 x+y^{2}+4 y=5$.", "generated_responses": ["}\nLet the given equation be\n$$x^2 - 8x + y^2 + 4y = 5$$\nWe can complete the square for $x$ and $y$:\n$$(x^2 - 8x + 16) + (y^2 + 4y + 4) = 5 + 16 + 4$$\n$$(x-4)^2 + (y+2)^2 = 25$$\nThis is the equation of a circle with center $(4, -2)$ and radius $r = \\sqrt{25} = 5$.\nWe are looking for ordered pairs $(x, y)$ of positive integers.\nSince $x$ and $y$ are positive integers, we must have $x > 0$ and $y > 0$.\nThe center of the circle is $(4, -2)$. The radius is $5$.\nThe possible values for $x$ are $4 \\pm 5$, so $x$ can be $4+5=9$ or $4-5=-1$. Since $x$ must be positive, we have $x=9$.\nIf $x=9$, then $(9-4)^2 + (y+2)^2 = 25$, so $5^2 + (y+2)^2 = 25$, which means $(y+2)^2 = 0$, so $y+2=0$, and $y=-2$. Since $y$ must be positive, this case does not yield a solution.\nThe possible values for $y$ are $-2 \\pm 5$, so $y$ can be $-2+5=3$ or $-2-5=-7$. Since $y$ must be positive, we have $y=3$.\nIf $y=3$, then $(x-4)^2 + (3+2)^2 = 25$, so $(x-4)^2 + 5^2 = 25$, which means $(x-4)^2 = 0$, so $x-4=0$, and $x=4$. Since $x$ is positive, this is a valid solution.\nThus, the only solution is $(4, 3)$.\nWe can check this solution:\n$$4^2 - 8(4) + 3^2 + 4(3) = 16 - 32 + 9 + 12 = 25 - 32 + 12 = 37 - 32 = 5$$\nSo $(4, 3)$ is a solution.\nNow we need to determine if there are other solutions.\nThe general solution for the equation $(x-4)^2 + (y+2)^2 = 25$ is\n$$x-4 = 5\\cos\\theta \\quad \\text{and} \\quad y+2 = 5\\sin\\theta$$\n$$x = 4 + 5\\cos\\theta \\quad \\text{and} \\quad y = -2 + 5\\sin\\theta$$\nSince $x$ and $y$ must be positive, we have\n$$4 + 5\\cos\\theta > 0 \\quad \\text{and} \\quad -2 + 5\\sin\\theta > 0$$\n$$5\\cos\\theta > -4 \\quad \\text{and} \\quad 5\\sin\\theta > 2$$\n$$\\cos\\theta > -\\frac{4}{5} \\quad \\text{and} \\quad \\sin\\theta > \\frac{2}{5}$$\nSince $\\cos\\theta >

We are given that $T = T N Y W R$, so $T=1$. Then $k = 21 + 2T = 21 + 2(1) = 23$.\nThus, $P(n) = 2n^2 - 23n + 77$.\nWe want to find the largest integer $n$ such that $P(n)$ is a positive prime number.\nWe can factor $P(n)$ as follows:\n$P(n) = 2n^2 - 23n + 77 = 2n^2 - 22n - n + 77 = 2n(n-11) - (n-11) = (2n-1)(n-11)$.\nWe want $P(n)$ to be a prime number, say $p$. Then we have $(2n-1)(n-11) = p$.\nSince $n$ is an integer, $2n-1$ and $n-11$ must be integer factors of $p$.\nSince $n$ is an integer, $2n-1$ and $n-11$ must be integers.\nWe have two cases:\nCase 1: $2n-1 = 1$ and $n-11 = p$. Then $2n-1 = 1$ implies $2n = 2$, so $n=1$. Then $n-11 = 1-11 = -10$, so $p = -10$, which is not a prime.\nCase 2: $2n-1 = p$ and $n-11 = 1$. Then $n-11 = 1$ implies $n=12$. Then $2n-1 = 2(12)-1 = 24-1 = 23$, so $p = 23$.\nCase 3: $2n-1 = -1$ and $n-11 = -p$. Then $2n-1 = -1$ implies $2n = 0$, so $n=0$. Then $n-11 = 0-11 = -11$, so $-p = -11$, which means $p=11$. However, $P(0) = 77 = 7 \\times 11$, which is not a prime.\nCase 4: $2n-1 = -p$ and $n-11 = -1$. Then $n-11 = -1$ implies $n=10$. Then $2n-1 = 2(10)-1 = 20-1 = 19$, so $-p = -19$, which means $p=19$. However, $P(10) = 2(10^2) - 23(10) + 77 = 200 - 230 + 77 = 47$, which is a prime.\nCase 5: $2n-1 = p$ and $n-11 = -1$. Then $n-11 = -1$ implies $n=10$. Then $2n-1 = 2(10)-1 = 19$, so $p = 19$.\nCase 6: $2n-1 = -1$ and $n-11 = p$. Then $n-11 = p$ implies $n = p+11$. Then $2n-1 = 2(p+11)-1 = 2p+22-1 = 2p+21$. So $2p+21 = -1$, which means $2p = -22$, so $p = -11$, which is not a prime.\nCase 7: $2n-1 = 1$ and $n-11 = p$. Then $n-11 = p$ implies $n = p+11$. Then $2n-1 = 2(p+11)-1 = 2p+22-1 = 2p+21 = 1$, so $2p = -20$, which means $p = -10$, which is not a prime.\nCase 8: $2n-1 = -p$ and $n-11 = -1$. Then $n-11 = -1$ implies $n=10$.

Then $(x-1)^2 + (y-1)^2 = 1$ and $x^2 + y^2 = 1$.\n$x^2 - 2x + 1 + y^2 - 2y + 1 = 1$ and $x^2 + y^2 = 1$.\n$x^2 + y^2 - 2x - 2y + 1 = 0$ and $x^2 + y^2 = 1$.\n$1 - 2x - 2y + 1 = 0$, so $2x + 2y = 2$, which means $x + y = 1$.\nSince $x^2 + y^2 = 1$, we have $(x+y)^2 - 2xy = 1$, so $1 - 2xy = 1$, which means $xy = 0$.\nSince $Q$ is in the interior of the square, $x \\neq 0$ and $y \\neq 0$. This is a contradiction.\nLet $s$ be the side length of the equilateral triangles. Then $AP = BQ = CR = DS = s$.\nSince $AB = 1$, we have $AP = s$, so $PB = 1-s$. Also, $AQ = s$, so $CQ = 1-s$.\nIn $\\triangle ABP$, $\\angle ABP = 60^\\circ$. In $\\triangle BCP$, $\\angle BCP = 60^\\circ$.\nIn $\\triangle CDP$, $\\angle CDP = 60^\\circ$. In $\\triangle DAP$, $\\angle DAP = 60^\\circ$.\nLet $P = (x,y)$. Then $AP = \\sqrt{x^2 + (y-1)^2} = s$ and $BP = \\sqrt{(x-1)^2 + (y-1)^2} = s$.\n$x^2 + (y-1)^2 = s^2$ and $(x-1)^2 + (y-1)^2 = s^2$.\n$x^2 + y^2 - 2y + 1 = s^2$ and $x^2 + y^2 - 2x + 1 = s^2$.\n$x^2 + y^2 - 2y = 0$ and $x^2 + y^2 - 2x = 0$.\n$x^2 + y^2 = 2y$ and $x^2 + y^2 = 2x$.\nThus $2y = 2x$, so $x = y$. Then $x^2 + y^2 = 2x$, so $x^2 + x^2 = 2x$, which means $2x^2 = 2x$, so $x^2 = x$.\nSince $x \\neq 0$, we have $x = 1$, which means $P = (1,1)$. But $P$ is in the interior, so $x < 1$. Thus $x = y = \\frac{1}{2}$.\nThen $P = (\\frac{1}{2}, \\frac{1}{2})$.\nSimilarly, $Q = (\\frac{1}{2}, \\frac{1}{2})$. Then $P = Q = R = S = (\\frac{1}{2}, \\frac{1}{2})$.\nThis is impossible since $P, Q, R, S$ are distinct.\n\nLet $s$ be the side length of the equilateral triangles. Then $AP = BQ = CR = DS = s$.\nSince $AB = 1$, we have $PB = 1-s$. Also, $AQ = 1-s$.\nIn $\\triangle ABP$, $\\angle ABP = 60^\\circ$. Then $\\angle PBC = 180^\\circ - 60^\\circ - 60^\\circ = 60^\\circ$.\nIn $\\triangle BCP$, $\\angle BCP = 60^\\circ$. Then $\\angle PBC = 60^\\circ$, so $\\triangle BCP$ is isosceles with $BP = CP = s$.\nThen $BP = CP = s$. Also, $PB = 1-s$.\nIn $\\triangle PBC$, $\\angle BPC = 180^\\circ - 60^\\circ - 60^\\circ = 60^\\circ$. Thus $\\triangle PBC$ is equilateral, so $BC = PC = BP = s$.\nThen $s = 1-s$, so $2s = 1$, and $s = \\frac{1}{2}$.\nThe area of $\\triangle PBC$ is $\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{4} s^2 = \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{4} (\\frac{1}{2})^2 = \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{4} \\frac{1}{4} = \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{16}$.\nThe area of the square is 1.

Also, $AC$ and $AD$ are relatively prime, i.e., $\\gcd(b, 229) = 1$.\nBy the Angle Bisector Theorem, we have $\\frac{AD}{BD} = \\frac{AC}{BC}$, so $\\frac{229}{BD} = \\frac{b}{a}$.

We want $D$ to be a perfect square, say $k^2$.\nSo, $a^2 - 3671a + 3168100 = k^2$.\nWe can rewrite this as $4a^2 - 14684a + 12672400 = 4k^2$.\nThis is $(2a - 3671)^2 - 3671^2 + 12672400 = 4k^2$.\nSo, $(2a - 3671)^2 - 13476000 + 12672400 = 4k^2$.\nThus, $(2a - 3671)^2 - 804600 = 4k^2$.\nLet $x = 2a - 3671$. Then $x^2 - 804600 = 4k^2$.\nSo, $x^2 - 4k^2 = 804600$.\nThus, $(x - 2k)(x + 2k) = 804600$.\nWe need to find pairs of factors of 804600 that differ by $4k$.\n$804600 = 2^3 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 5^2 \\cdot 67$.\nWe are looking for two factors $u$ and $v$ such that $uv = 804600$ and $u - v = 4k$.\nAlso, $x = \\frac{u+v}{2}$ and $2a - 3671 = x$, so $2a = x + 3671$.\nSince $a$ is an integer, $x$ must have the same parity as 3671, which is odd.\nThus, $u$ and $v$ must have the same parity, so they are either both even or both odd.\nSince $804600$ is even, both $u$ and $v$ must be even.\nPossible pairs of factors are:\n(2, 402300), (4, 201150), (10, 80460), (20, 40230), (30, 26820), (40, 20115), (60, 13410), (100, 8046), (120, 6705), (134, 6000), (150, 5364), (160, 5028), (179, 4500), (190, 4230), (200, 4023), (229, 3540), (240, 3355), (268, 3000), (270, 2940), (280, 2865), (300, 2682), (319, 2520), (320, 2514), (330, 2400), (340, 2300), (354, 2290), (360, 2265), (379, 2160), (380, 2145), (390, 2060), (400, 2011.5), ...\nWe need $u$ and $v$ to be even.\nLet $u = 2m$ and $v = 2n$. Then $(2m)(2n) = 804600$, so $4mn = 804600$, which means $mn = 201150$.\nAlso, $2m - 2n = 4k$, so $m - n = 2k$.\nWe need $m$ and $n$ to be integers.\nWe have $201150 = 2 \\cdot 5^2 \\cdot 67$.\nPossible pairs of factors are:\n(2, 100575), (5, 40230), (10, 20115), (25, 8046), (50, 4023), (67, 3000), (125, 1609.2), ...\nWe need $m$ and $n$ to be integers.\nIf $a = 500$, then $x = 2a - 3671 = 1000 - 3671 = -2671$, which is not possible.\nIf $a = 500$, then $2a = 1000$, so $b + c = 1019$.\nAlso, $\\gcd(b, 229) = 1$.\nLet $b = 500$. Then $c = 519$. $\\gcd(500, 229) = 1$.\n$229a = b(c-229)$, so $229(500) = 500(519-229) = 500(290) = 145000$.\n$114500 = 145000$, which is false.\nLet $a = 500$. Then $b+c = 1019$. Also, $b = 500$, $c = 519$.\nThen $b^2 + (a-1790)b + 229a = 500^2 + (500-1790)(500) + 229(500) = 250000 + (-1290)(500) + 114500 = 250000 - 645000 + 114500 = -280000$, which is not a perfect square.\n\nIf $a = 500$, then $x = 2a - 3671 = -2671$.

The slope of $OP$ is $\\frac{y-r}{x-r}$. Since $OP \\perp AB$, we have $\\frac{y-r}{x-r} = 1$, so $y-r = x-r$, which means $y=x$.\nSince $P$ is tangent to $OA$ and $OB$, we have $OA = \\sqrt{r^2 + r^2} = r\\sqrt{2}$ and $OB = \\sqrt{r^2 + r^2} = r\\sqrt{2}$.

{"question": "Elizabeth is in an \"escape room\" puzzle. She is in a room with one door which is locked at the start of the puzzle. The room contains $n$ light switches, each of which is initially off. Each minute, she must flip exactly $k$ different light switches (to \"flip\" a switch means to turn it on if it is currently off, and off if it is currently on). At the end of each minute, if all of the switches are on, then the door unlocks and Elizabeth escapes from the room.\n\nLet $E(n, k)$ be the minimum number of minutes required for Elizabeth to escape, for positive integers $n, k$ with $k \\leq n$. For example, $E(2,1)=2$ because Elizabeth cannot escape in one minute (there are two switches and one must be flipped every minute) but she can escape in two minutes (by flipping Switch 1 in the first minute and Switch 2 in the second minute). Define $E(n, k)=\\infty$ if the puzzle is impossible to solve (that is, if it is impossible to have all switches on at the end of any minute).\n\nFor convenience, assume the $n$ light switches are numbered 1 through $n$.\nFind the following in terms of $n$. $E(n, 2)$ for positive even integers $n$", "generated_responses": ["Let $E(n, k)$ be the minimum number of minutes required for Elizabeth to escape.\nWe want to find $E(n, 2)$ for positive even integers $n$.\nLet $S_i$ be the $i$-th switch for $i=1, 2, \\dots, n$.\nAt each minute, we flip exactly 2 switches.\nWe want to find the minimum number of minutes such that all $n$ switches are on.\nLet $a_i$ be the number of times switch $i$ is flipped.\nWe want to have $a_i \\equiv 1 \\pmod{2}$ for all $i=1, 2, \\dots, n$.\nSince we flip 2 switches at each minute, the total number of flips is $2 \\times \\text{number of minutes}$.\nLet $m$ be the number of minutes.

Since $M$ is inside the square, $x>0$ and $y>0$.\nWe have $ME^2 = (x-20)^2 + y^2 = s^2$ and $MN^2 = (x-20)^2 + (y-20)^2 = s^2$.\nSince $ME=MF$, we have $(x-20)^2 + y^2 = (x-0)^2 + (y-20)^2$, so $(x-20)^2 + y^2 = x^2 + (y-20)^2$.\nExpanding, we get $x^2 - 40x + 400 + y^2 = x^2 + y^2 - 40y + 400$, so $-40x = -40y$, which means $x=y$.\nSince $M$ is inside the square, $0 < x < 20$ and $0 < y < 20$.

But $x < 20$, so we must have $x = 10 - 10\\sqrt{3}$.\nThen $x = 10 - 10\\sqrt{3}$. Since $x>0$, we have $10 - 10\\sqrt{3} > 0$, so $10 > 10\\sqrt{3}$, which means $1 > \\sqrt{3}$, which is false.\nWe have $x = 10 - 10\\sqrt{3}$. Then $x^2 = (10 - 10\\sqrt{3})^2 = 100 - 200\\sqrt{3} + 300 = 400 - 200\\sqrt{3}$.\nAlso, $(x-20)^2 = (10 - 10\\sqrt{3} - 20)^2 = (-10 - 10\\sqrt{3})^2 = 100 + 200\\sqrt{3} + 300 = 400 + 200\\sqrt{3}$.\nThen $ME^2 = (x-20)^2 + x^2 = 400 + 200\\sqrt{3} + 400 - 200\\sqrt{3} = 800$.\n$ME^2 = 800$, so $ME = \\sqrt{800} = 20\\sqrt{2}$.\n$ME^2 = (x-20)^2 + y^2 = (x-20)^2 + x^2 = 800$.\n$K M^2 = x^2 + y^2 = x^2 + x^2 = 2x^2 = 2(400 - 200\\sqrt{3}) = 800 - 400\\sqrt{3}$.\n$K M^2 = 800 - 400\\sqrt{3}$.
