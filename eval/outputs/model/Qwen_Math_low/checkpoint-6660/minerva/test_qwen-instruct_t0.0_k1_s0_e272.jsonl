{"question": "Buzz, the hot new dining spot on campus, emphasizes simplicity. It only has two items on the menu, burgers and zucchini.

{"question": "Determine the minimum potential in V (to 2 decimal places) that must be applied to an $\\alpha$-particle so that on interaction with a hydrogen atom, a ground state electron will be excited to $n$ $=6$.", "generated_responses": ["Let $V$ be the potential applied to the $\\alpha$-particle.\nThe $\\alpha$-particle has a charge of $2e$, where $e$ is the elementary charge.\nThe hydrogen atom has a charge of $-e$.\nThe distance between the $\\alpha$-particle and the hydrogen atom is $d$.\nThe potential energy of the $\\alpha$-particle is $U = \\frac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0} \\frac{2e(-e)}{d} = -\\frac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0} \\frac{2e^2}{d}$.\nWe are given that the potential must be applied to the $\\alpha$-particle so that on interaction with a hydrogen atom, a ground state electron will be excited to $n=6$.\nThe energy of the ground state of the hydrogen atom is $E_1 = -\\frac{1}{2} \\frac{e^2}{a_0^2}$, where $a_0$ is the Bohr radius.\nThe energy of the $n=6$

{"question": "What is the working temperature for silica glass in Celsius?", "generated_responses": ["The working temperature for silica glass is approximately 1000 degrees Celsius. However, the exact temperature can vary depending on the specific application and the glass type.\nSilica glass is a type of glass that is made from the mineral silicon. It is a very strong and durable glass, and is often used in applications where high temperatures are involved.\nThe working temperature of silica glass is the temperature at which the glass can be used without breaking or losing its properties. For silica glass, the working temperature is typically around 1000 degrees Celsius.\nHowever, it is important to note that the working temperature can vary depending on the specific application and the glass type. For example, if the glass is used in a high-temperature application, such as in a kiln or a furnace, then the working temperature may be higher than 1000 degrees Celsius.\nOn the other hand, if the glass is used in a low-temperature application, such as in a window or a door, then the working temperature may be lower than 1000 degrees Celsius.\nIn general, the working temperature for silica glass is around 1000 degrees Celsius.\n\nFinal Answer: The final answer is $\\boxed{1000}$"], "generated_answers": ["1000"], "gold_answer": "1950", "is_correct": false, "answers_correctness": [false]}
