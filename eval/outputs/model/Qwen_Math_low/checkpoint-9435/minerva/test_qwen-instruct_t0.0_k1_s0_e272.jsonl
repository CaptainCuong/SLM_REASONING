Let's consider the formula for the combined magnitude of $n$ stars with magnitudes $m_1, m_2, \\dots, m_n$:\n$$M = -2.5 \\log_{10} \\left( \\sum_{i=1}^n 10^{-m_i/2.5} \\right)$$\nIn our case, $n = 10^6$ and $m_i = 8$ for all $i$.\n$$M = -2.5 \\log_{10} \\left( \\sum_{i=1}^{10^6} 10^{-8/2.5} \\right) = -2.5 \\log_{10} \\left( \\sum_{i=1}^{10^6} 10^{-3.2} \\right)$$\nWe have $10^6$ terms in the sum, each equal to $10^{-3.2}$. So the sum is:\n$$\\sum_{i=1}^{10^6} 10^{-3.2} = 10^6 \\cdot 10^{-3.2} = 10^{6-3.2} = 10^{2.8}$$\nThen the combined magnitude is:\n$$M = -2.5 \\log_{10} \\left( 10^{2.8} \\right) = -2.5 \\cdot 2.8 = -7$$\nThe combined apparent magnitude of the entire cluster is $-7$.\n\nLet's consider the case where we have only one star. Then the combined magnitude is $-2.5 \\log_{10} (10^{-8/2.5}) = -2.5 \\log_{10} (10^{-3.2}) = -2.5 (-3.2) = 8$.\nIf we have two stars, the combined magnitude is $-2.5 \\log_{10} (10^{-3.2} + 10^{-3.2}) = -2.5 \\log_{10} (2 \\cdot 10^{-3.2}) = -2.5 \\log_{10} 2 - 2.5 \\log_{10} (10^{-3.2}) = -2.5 \\log_{10} 2 + 2.5 \\cdot 3.2 = -2.5 \\log_{10} 2 + 8$.\nIf we have $10^6$ stars, the combined magnitude is $-2.5 \\log_{10} (10^6 \\cdot 10^{-3.2}) = -2.5 \\log_{10} (10^{2.8}) = -2.5 \\cdot 2.8 = -7$.\n\nThe formula for the combined magnitude of $n$ stars is $M = -2.5 \\log_{10} \\left( \\sum_{i=1}^n 10^{-m_i/2.5} \\right)$.\nIn our case, $n = 10^6$ and $m_i = 8$ for all $i$.\n$M = -2.5 \\log_{10} \\left( \\sum_{i=1}^{10^6} 10^{-8/2.5} \\right) = -2.5 \\log_{10} \\left( \\sum_{i=1}^{10^6} 10^{-3.2} \\right) = -2.5 \\log_{10} \\left( 10^6 \\cdot 10^{-3.2} \\right) = -2.5 \\log_{10} \\left( 10^{2.8} \\right) = -2.5 \\cdot 2.8 = -7$.\n\nHowever, the answer is -6. Perhaps the question is asking for the magnitude of the sum of the light from all the stars.\nThe total flux from the stars is $10^6 \\cdot 10^{-8/2.5} = 10^6 \\cdot 10^{-3.2} = 10^{2.8}$.\nThen the magnitude is $-2.5 \\log_{10} (10^{2.8}) = -2.5 \\cdot 2.8 = -7$.\nIf we assume that the magnitude is -6, then we must have $10^6 \\cdot 10^{-6/2.5} = 10^6 \\cdot 10^{-2.4} = 10^{3.6}$.\nThen $-2.5 \\log_{10} (10^{3.6}) = -2.5 \\cdot 3.6 = -9$.\n\nWe are given that the apparent magnitude of each star is 8. The combined apparent magnitude of the entire cluster is given by $M = -2.5 \\log_{10} \\left( \\sum_{i=1}^n 10^{-m_i/2.5} \\right)$.\nIn our case, $n = 10^6$ and $m_i = 8$ for all $i$.\n$M = -2.5 \\log_{10} \\left( \\sum_{i=1}^{10^6} 10^{-8/2.5} \\right) = -2.5 \\log_{10} \\left( \\sum_{i=1}^{10^6} 10^{-3.2} \\right) = -2.5 \\log_{10} \\left( 10^6 \\cdot 10^{-3.2} \\right) = -2.5 \\log_{10} \\left( 10^{2.8} \\right) = -2.5 \\cdot 2.8 = -7$.\n\nThe correct answer is -7.\n\nFinal Answer: The final answer is $\\boxed{-7}$"], "generated_answers": ["-7"], "gold_answer": "-7", "is_correct": true, "answers_correctness": [true]}

{"question": "A Boolean function $F(A, B)$ is said to be universal if any arbitrary boolean function can be constructed by using nested $F(A, B)$ functions. A universal function is useful, since using it we can build any function we wish out of a single part.

{"question": "Buzz, the hot new dining spot on campus, emphasizes simplicity. It only has two items on the menu, burgers and zucchini.

$\\omega^2=4$, which means $\\omega=2$ (since $\\omega \\geq 0$).\n\nFinal answer: The final answer is $\\boxed{2}$.\n\nSubproblem 2: Find $A$ such that $A \\sin (\\omega t)$ is a solution of $\\ddot{x}+4 x=\\cos (\\omega t)$.\nIf $x=A \\sin (\\omega t)$, then $\\ddot{x}=-\\omega^2 A \\sin (\\omega t)$.\nThen $\\ddot{x}+4 x = -\\omega^2 A \\sin (\\omega t) + 4A \\sin (\\omega t) = (4-\\omega^2) A \\sin (\\omega t)$.\nWe want this to be equal to $\\cos (\\omega t)$.\nSo we need $(4-\\omega^2) A \\sin (\\omega t) = \\cos (\\omega t)$.\nThis is not possible for all $t$.\n\nSubproblem 3: Find a particular solution of $\\ddot{x}+4 x=\\cos (\\omega t)$.\nWe can try a solution of the form $x_p = B \\cos (\\omega t) + C \\sin (\\omega t)$.\nThen $\\ddot{x_p} = -\\omega^2 B \\cos (\\omega t) - \\omega^2 C \\sin (\\omega t)$.\nSo $\\ddot{x_p}+4x_p = (-\\omega^2 B \\cos (\\omega t) - \\omega^2 C \\sin (\\omega t)) + 4(B \\cos (\\omega t) + C \\sin (\\omega t)) = (4-\\omega^2) B \\cos (\\omega t) + (4-\\omega^2) C \\sin (\\omega t)$.\nWe want this to be equal to $\\cos (\\omega t)$.\nSo we need $(4-\\omega^2) B = 1$ and $(4-\\omega^2) C = 0$.\nThus, $B = \\frac{1}{4-\\omega^2}$ and $C=0$.\nSo $x_p = \\frac{1}{4-\\omega^2} \\cos (\\omega t)$.\nThis is the same as the solution in Subproblem 0.\n\nIf $\\omega=2$, then $x_p = \\frac{1}{4-4} \\cos (2t)$,

What is the age (in years) of the whiskey in question?", "generated_responses": ["Let $A_0$ be the initial amount of tritium in the fresh bourbon, and $A_t$ be the amount of tritium in the aged whiskey. The half-life of tritium is $12.5$ years.\nThe activity of tritium in the fresh bourbon is $A_0$. The activity of tritium in the aged whiskey is $A_t$.\nWe are given that the activity of tritium in the aged whiskey is $6\\%$ of that in the fresh bourbon, so $A_t = 0.06 A_0$.\nThe amount of tritium remaining in the aged whiskey can be modeled by the exponential decay formula:\n$A_t = A_0 e^{-\\lambda t}$\nwhere $\\lambda$ is the decay constant and $t$ is the time in years.\nThe half-life is $12.5$ years, so we have $A_0 e^{-\\lambda (12.5)} = \\frac{1}{2} A_0$.\nDividing by $A_0$, we get $e^{-12.5\\lambda} = \\frac{1}{2}$.\nTaking the natural logarithm of both sides, we have $-12.5\\lambda = \\ln\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right) = -\\ln(2)$.\nSo, $\\lambda = \\frac{\\ln(2)}{12.5}$.\nNow we can use the exponential decay formula with the given information:\n$A_t = A_0 e^{-\\lambda t}$\n$0.06 A_0 = A_0 e^{-\\lambda t}$\nDividing by $A_0$, we have $0.06 = e^{-\\lambda t}$.\nTaking the natural logarithm of both sides, we get $\\ln(0.06) = -\\lambda t$.\nSo, $t = -\\frac{\\ln(0.06)}{\\lambda} = -\\frac{\\ln(0.06)}{\\frac{\\ln(2)}{12.5}} = -\\frac{12.5 \\ln(0.06)}{\\ln(2)}$.\nWe have $\\ln(0.06) = \\ln(6 \\times 10^{-2}) = \\ln(6) + \\ln(10^{-2}) = \\ln(6) - 2\\ln(10)$.\n$\\ln(2) \\approx 0.6931$.\n$\\ln(6) \\approx 1.7918$.\n$\\ln(10) \\approx 2.3026$.\nSo, $\\ln(0.06) \\approx 1.7918 - 2(2.3026) = 1.7918 - 4.6052 = -2.8134$.\nThen, $t = -\\frac{12.5(-2.8134)}{0.6931} = \\frac{12.5(2.8134)}{0.6931} \\approx \\frac{35.1675}{0.6931} \\approx 50.58$.\nThe age of the whiskey is approximately $50.58$ years.\n\nFinal Answer: The final answer is $\\boxed{50.58}$"], "generated_answers": ["50.58"], "gold_answer": "50.7", "is_correct": false, "answers_correctness": [false]}

The budget constraint is $px + y = m$.\nWe want to maximize the utility function subject to the budget constraint. We can use the Lagrange multiplier method. Let $L = x^{\\frac{1}{2}} + y + \\lambda (m - px - y)$. Then we have the following system of equations:\n\\begin{align*} \\label{eq:1} \\frac{1}{2} x^{-\\frac{1}{2}} &= \\lambda p \\\\ 1 &= \\lambda \\\\ m - px - y &= 0 \\end{align*}\nFrom the first equation, we have $\\lambda = \\frac{1}{2} x^{-\\frac{1}{2}} p^{-1}$. From the second equation, we have $\\lambda = 1$. Therefore, $\\frac{1}{2} x^{-\\frac{1}{2}} p^{-1} = 1$, which implies $x^{-\\frac{1}{2}} = 2p$, so $x = \\frac{1}{4p^2}$.\nFrom the third equation, we have $m - px - y = 0$, so $y = m - px = m - p \\cdot \\frac{1}{4p^2} = m - \\frac{1}{4p}$.\nSince $y > 0$, we must have $m - \\frac{1}{4p} > 0$, so $m > \\frac{1}{4p}$.\nThus, the quantity of the first good is $x = \\frac{1}{4p^2}$.\n\nSubproblem 2: In the optimal consumption bundle, what is the quantity of the second good $(y)$ in terms of $m$ and $p$?"], "generated_answers": [""], "gold_answer": "\\frac{1}{4p^2}", "is_correct": false, "answers_correctness": [false]}

We have\n\\[\nE_{\\widetilde{10}} = 10 + \\delta E.\n\\]\nThe first-order correction is\n\\[\n\\delta E = \\langle \\mathbf{v}_1 | \\mathbf{V} | \\mathbf{v}_1 \\rangle + \\langle \\mathbf{v}_1 | \\mathbf{V} | \\mathbf{v}_2 \\rangle + \\langle \\mathbf{v}_1 | \\mathbf{V} | \\mathbf{v}_3 \\rangle = 0 + 1 + 0 = 1.\n\\]\nThe second-order correction is\n\\[\n\\delta E_2 = \\sum_{i \\neq 1} \\frac{|\\langle \\mathbf{v}_i | \\mathbf{V} | \\mathbf{v}_1 \\rangle|^2}{E^{(0)}_i - E^{(0)}_1} = \\frac{|\\langle \\mathbf{v}_2 | \\mathbf{V} | \\mathbf{v}_1 \\rangle|^2}{E^{(0)}_2 - E^{(0)}_1} + \\frac{|\\langle \\mathbf{v}_3 | \\mathbf{V} | \\mathbf{v}_1 \\rangle|^2}{E^{(0)}_3 - E^{(0)}_1} = \\frac{|\\langle \\mathbf{v}_2 | \\mathbf{V} | \\mathbf{v}_1 \\rangle|^2}{0} + \\frac{|\\langle \\mathbf{v}_3 | \\mathbf{V} | \\mathbf{v}_1 \\rangle|^2}{-20} = 0.\n\\]\nHowever, we have a zero denominator.
