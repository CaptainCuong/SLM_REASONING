Let $r_1$ and $r_2$ be the orbital radii of Star 1 and Star 2, respectively. The center of mass of the binary system is given by\n$$ \\frac{M_1 r_1 + M_2 r_2}{M_1 + M_2} = 0 $$\nSince $r_2$ is given as $3 \\times 10^{10} \\mathrm{m}$, we have $r_2 = 3 \\times 10^{10} \\mathrm{m} = 3 \\times 10^{12} \\mathrm{cm}$.\nThe orbital speed of Star 1 is given by $v_1 = 20 \\mathrm{km} \\mathrm{s}^{-1} = 20 \\times 10^3 \\mathrm{m} \\mathrm{s}^{-1}$.\nWe have $v_1 = \\frac{2 \\pi r_1}{P_{\\text{orb}}}$, where $P_{\\text{orb}} = 10 \\text{ days} = 10 \\times 24 \\times 60 \\times 60 = 10 \\times 24 \\times 3600 = 86400 \\text{ s}$.\nThus, $20 \\times 10^3 = \\frac{2 \\pi r_1}{86400}$, so $r_1 = \\frac{20 \\times 10^3 \\times 86400}{2 \\pi} = \\frac{20 \\times 10^3 \\times 43200}{\\pi} = \\frac{864000000}{\\pi} \\approx 277384 \\text{ m}$.\nThen $r_1 \\approx 277384 \\text{ m} = 277384 \\times 100 \\text{ cm} = 27738400 \\text{ cm}$.\n\nThe center of mass is the point where the two stars balance each other. The mass of Star 1 is $M_1 = \\frac{v_1^2 r_1}{G}$, and the mass of Star 2 is $M_2 = \\frac{v_2^2 r_2}{G}$, where $G$ is the gravitational constant.\nSince $M_1 r_1 = M_2 r_2$, we have $\\frac{v_1^2 r_1}{G} r_1 = \\frac{v_2^2 r_2}{G} r_2$, so $v_1^2 r_1^2 = v_2^2 r_2^2$.\nThus, $v_1 r_1 = v_2 r_2$.\nWe have $v_1 = 20 \\times 10^3 \\text{ m/s}$ and $r_2 = 3 \\times 10^{10} \\text{ m}$.\nThe orbital speed of Star 2 is $v_2 = \\frac{2 \\pi r_2}{P_{\\text{orb}}} = \\frac{2 \\pi (3 \\times 10^{10})}{86400} = \\frac{6 \\pi \\times 10^{10}}{86400} = \\frac{6 \\pi \\times 10^4}{864} = \\frac{60000 \\pi}{864} = \\frac{2500 \\pi}{36} = \\frac{1250 \\pi}{18} = \\frac{625 \\pi}{9} \\approx 218.17 \\text{ km/s}$.\nThen $v_1 r_1 = v_2 r_2$, so $20 \\times 10^3 r_1 = \\frac{625 \\pi}{9} (3 \\times 10^{10})$.\nThus, $r_1 = \\frac{625 \\pi}{9} \\frac{3 \\times 10^{10}}{20 \\times 10^3} = \\frac{625 \\pi}{9} \\frac{300000000}{20000} = \\frac{625 \\pi}{9} \\frac{3000}{2} = \\frac{625 \\pi}{9} \\times 1500 = \\frac{937500 \\pi}{9} = 104166.67 \\pi \\approx 327249.2 \\text{ m}$.\nThen $r_1 \\approx 327249.2 \\text{ m} = 32724920 \\text{ cm}$.\n\nLet $M_1$ and $M_2$ be the masses of the two stars. Then $M_1 r_1 = M_2 r_2$.\nAlso, the total mass is $M_1 + M_2 = M$.\nWe have $r_1 = \\frac{M_2}{M} r_2$.\nThe orbital speed of star 1 is $v_1 = \\frac{2 \\pi r_1}{P_{\\text{orb}}}$, so $20 \\times 10^3 = \\frac{2 \\pi r_1}{86400}$.\nThen $r_1 = \\frac{20 \\times 10^3 \\times 86400}{2 \\pi} = \\frac{20 \\times 10^3 \\times 43200}{\\pi} = \\frac{864000000}{\\pi}$.\nWe have $r_2 = 3 \\times 10^{10} \\text{ m} = 3 \\times 10^{12} \\text{ cm}$.\nWe have $r_1 = \\frac{M_2}{M} r_2$, so $r_1 = \\frac{M_2}{M} (3 \\times 10^{12})$.\nThen $\\frac{864000000}{\\pi} = \\frac{M_2}{M} (3 \\times 10^{12})$.\nThus, $M_2 = \\frac{864000000}{3 \\pi \\times 10^{12}} M = \\frac{864000000}{3 \\pi \\times 10^{12}} M$.\nThe mass of the system is $M = M_1 + M_2 = \\frac{864000000}{\\pi} + \\frac{864000000}{3 \\pi \\times 10^{12}} M$.\nThis doesn't seem right.\n\nWe have $v_1 r_1 = v_2 r_2$.\n$v_1 = 20 \\times 10^3 \\text{ m/s}$.\n$r_2 = 3 \\times 10^{10} \\text{ m}$.\n$v_2 = \\frac{2 \\pi r_2}{P_{\\text{orb}}} = \\frac{2 \\pi (3 \\times 10^{10})}{86400} = \\frac{6 \\pi \\times 10^{10}}{86400} = \\frac{6 \\pi \\times 10^4}{864} = \\frac{60000 \\pi}{864} = \\frac{2500 \\pi}{36} = \\frac{1250 \\pi}{18} = \\frac{625 \\pi}{9}$.\n$v_1 r_1 = v_2 r_2$, so $20 \\times 10^3 r_1 = \\frac{625 \\pi}{9} (3 \\times 10^{10})$.\n$r_1 = \\frac{625 \\pi}{9} \\frac{3 \\times 10^{10}}{20 \\times 10^3} = \\frac{625 \\pi}{9} \\frac{300000000}{20000} = \\frac{625 \\pi}{9} \\frac{3000}{2} = \\frac{625 \\pi}{9} \\times 1500 = \\frac{937500 \\pi}{9} = 104166.67 \\pi \\approx 327249.2 \\text{ m}$.\n$r_1 \\approx 32724920 \\text{ cm}$.\n\nThe correct answer is 900000000.\n$v_1 r_1 = v_2 r_2$\n$20 \\times 10^3 r_1 = v_2 (3 \\times 10^{10})$\n$r_1 = \\frac{v_2 \\times 3 \\times 10^{10}}{20 \\times 10^3} = \\frac{v_2 \\times 300000000}{20000} = \\frac{v_2 \\times 3000}{2} = 1500 v_2$\nWe have $v_2 = \\frac{2 \\pi r_2}{P_{\\text{orb}}} = \\frac{2 \\pi (3 \\times 10^{10})}{86400} = \\frac{6 \\pi \\times 10^{10}}{86400} = \\frac{6 \\pi \\times 10^4}{864} = \\frac{60000 \\pi}{864} = \\frac{2500 \\pi}{36} = \\frac{1250 \\pi}{18} = \\frac{625 \\pi}{9}$.\nThen $r_1 = 1500 \\times \\frac{625 \\pi}{9} = \\frac{1500 \\times 625 \\pi}{9} = \\frac{937500 \\pi}{9} = 104166.67 \\pi \\approx 327249.2$.\n\nLet $M_1$ and $M_2$ be the masses of the two stars.

{"question": "Buzz, the hot new dining spot on campus, emphasizes simplicity. It only has two items on the menu, burgers and zucchini.

Unfortunately the two letters sound similar so $8 \\%$ of the time the cooks misinterpret what was said.

The customers arrive at the rate of one per second.

We are given that the surface concentration of chromium remains constant at $100\\%$, so $C(0,t) = 1$. We want to find the time $t$ it takes to achieve a $\\mathrm{Cr}$ concentration of $1.8\\%$ at a depth of $0.002 \\mathrm{cm}$ below the steel surface, i.e., $C(0.002,t) = 0.018$.\n\nThe diffusion equation is given by $\\frac{\\partial C}{\\partial t} = D \\frac{\\partial^2 C}{\\partial x^2}$, where $D$ is the diffusion coefficient. We are given $D_o = 0.54 \\mathrm{cm}^2/\\mathrm{s}$.\n\nWe can use the solution to the diffusion equation for a constant surface concentration. The solution is given by $C(x,t) = \\frac{1}{2} \\left[ \\frac{x}{\\sqrt{4 \\pi D t}} \\right]$.\nHowever, we are given that the surface concentration is $100\\%$, so we need to consider the complementary concentration, which is $1 - C(x,t)$.\nWe want to find the time $t$ such that $C(0.002,t) = 0.018$. This means that the complementary concentration is $1 - 0.018 = 0.982$.\nThe solution to the diffusion equation for the complementary concentration is given by $1 - C(x,t) = \\frac{1}{2} \\left[ \\frac{x}{\\sqrt{4 \\pi D t}} \\right]$.\nSo, we have $1 - 0.018 = \\frac{1}{2} \\left[ \\frac{0.002}{\\sqrt{4 \\pi D t}} \\right]$.\n$0.982 = \\frac{1}{2} \\left[ \\frac{0.002}{\\sqrt{4 \\pi D t}} \\right]$\n$0.982 = \\frac{0.001}{\\sqrt{4 \\pi D t}}$\n$0.982^2 = \\frac{0.001^2}{4 \\pi D t}$\n$0.964084 = \\frac{0.000001}{4 \\pi (0.54) t}$\n$0.964084 = \\frac{0.000001}{2.16 \\pi t}$\n$0.964084 \\times 2.16 \\pi t = 0.000001$\n$2.0736 \\pi t = 0.000001$\n$t = \\frac{0.000001}{2.0736 \\pi} = \\frac{0.000001}{6.4937} \\approx 1.548 \\times 10^{-6} \\mathrm{s}$\n\nHowever, we are given that the answer is 1.5 days.

In this \"shine\" the activity is found to be $6 \\%$ of that encountered in fresh bourbon. What is the age (in years) of the whiskey in question?", "generated_responses": ["Let $A_0$ be the initial amount of tritium in the fresh bourbon, and $A_t$ be the amount of tritium in the aged whiskey. The half-life of tritium is $12.5$ years.\nThe activity of tritium in the fresh bourbon is $A_0$. The activity of tritium in the aged whiskey is $A_t$.\nWe are given that the activity of tritium in the aged whiskey is $6\\%$ of that in the fresh bourbon, so $A_t = 0.06 A_0$.\nThe amount of tritium remaining in the aged whiskey can be modeled by the exponential decay formula:\n$A_t = A_0 e^{-\\lambda t}$, where $\\lambda$ is the decay constant and $t$ is the time in years.\nThe half-life is $12.5$ years, so $A_0 e^{-\\lambda (12.5)} = \\frac{1}{2} A_0$.\nDividing by $A_0$, we get $e^{-12.5\\lambda} = \\frac{1}{2}$.\nTaking the natural logarithm of both sides, we have $-12.5\\lambda = \\ln\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right) = -\\ln(2)$.\nThus, $\\lambda = \\frac{\\ln(2)}{12.5}$.\nNow we can use the exponential decay formula to find the age of the whiskey:\n$A_t = A_0 e^{-\\lambda t}$\n$0.06 A_0 = A_0 e^{-\\lambda t}$\n$0.06 = e^{-\\lambda t}$\nTaking the natural logarithm of both sides, we have\n$\\ln(0.06) = -\\lambda t$\n$t = -\\frac{\\ln(0.06)}{\\lambda} = -\\frac{\\ln(0.06)}{\\frac{\\ln(2)}{12.5}} = -\\frac{12.5 \\ln(0.06)}{\\ln(2)}$\nWe have $\\ln(0.06) = \\ln(6 \\times 10^{-2}) = \\ln(6) + \\ln(10^{-2}) = \\ln(6) - 2\\ln(10)$.\n$\\ln(2) \\approx 0.6931$.\n$\\ln(6) \\approx 1.7918$.\n$\\ln(10) \\approx 2.3026$.\nSo, $\\ln(0.06) \\approx 1.7918 - 2(2.3026) = 1.7918 - 4.6052 = -2.8134$.\nThen, $t = -\\frac{12.5(-2.8134)}{0.6931} = \\frac{12.5(2.8134)}{0.6931} \\approx \\frac{35.1675}{0.6931} \\approx 50.58$.\nThe age of the whiskey is approximately $50.58$ years.\n\nFinal Answer: The final answer is $\\boxed{50.58}$"], "generated_answers": ["50.58"], "gold_answer": "50.7", "is_correct": false, "answers_correctness": [false]}
