{"question": "Buzz, the hot new dining spot on campus, emphasizes simplicity. It only has two items on the menu, burgers and zucchini.

{"question": "Consider the following \"mixing problem.\" A tank holds $V$ liters of salt water. Suppose that a saline solution with concentration of $c \\mathrm{gm} /$ liter is added at the rate of $r$ liters/minute. A mixer keeps the salt essentially uniformly distributed in the tank. A pipe lets solution out of the tank at the same rate of $r$ liters/minute. The differential equation for the amount of salt in the tank is given by \n\\[\nx^{\\prime}+\\frac{r}{V} x-r c=0 .\n\\]\nSuppose that the out-flow from this tank leads into another tank, also of volume 1 , and that at time $t=1$ the water in it has no salt in it. Again there is a mixer and an outflow. Write down a differential equation for the amount of salt in this second tank, as a function of time, assuming the amount of salt in the second tank at moment $t$ is given by $y(t)$, and the amount of salt in the first tank at moment $t$ is given by $x(t)$.", "generated_responses": ["Let $x(t)$ be the amount of salt in the first tank at time $t$, and $y(t)$ be the amount of salt in the second tank at time $t$.\nThe first tank has a volume $V$ liters, and the concentration of the incoming solution is $c \\mathrm{gm}/\\text{liter}$. The rate of change of the amount of salt in the first tank is given by\n\\[ x'(t) + \\frac{r}{V} x(t) - r c = 0. \\]\nThe second tank has a volume of 1 liter. The rate of change of the amount of salt in the second tank is given by the amount of salt that enters the second tank minus the amount of salt that leaves the second tank. The amount of salt that enters the second tank is the amount of salt that leaves the first tank, which is $r x(t)$. The amount of salt that leaves the second tank is $r y(t)$. Thus, we have\n\\[ y'(t) = r x(t) - r y(t). \\]\nWe are given that at $t=1$, the second tank has no salt in it, so $y(1) = 0$.\nWe first solve for $x(t)$ from the first equation. The equation is a first-order linear ODE. We can rewrite it as\n\\[ x'(t) + \\frac{r}{V} x(t) = r c. \\]\nThe integrating factor is $e^{\\int \\frac{r}{V} dt} = e^{\\frac{r}{V} t}$. Multiplying both sides by the integrating factor, we get\n\\[ e^{\\frac{r}{V} t} x'(t) + \\frac{r}{V} e^{\\frac{r}{V} t} x(t) = r c e^{\\frac{r}{V} t}. \\]\nThis simplifies to\n\\[ \\frac{d}{dt} \\left( e^{\\frac{r}{V} t} x(t) \\right) = r c e^{\\frac{r}{V} t}. \\]\nIntegrating both sides with respect to $t$, we get\n\\[ e^{\\frac{r}{V} t} x(t) = \\int r c e^{\\frac{r}{V} t} dt = r c \\frac{V}{r} e^{\\frac{r}{V} t} + C = c V e^{\\frac{r}{V} t} + C. \\]\nThus, $x(t) = c V + C e^{-\\frac{r}{V} t}$.\nSince $y(1) = 0$, we have\n\\[ y'(t) = r x(t) - r y(t) = r (c V + C e^{-\\frac{r}{V} t}) - r y(t). \\]\n\\[ y'(t) + r y(t) = r c V + r C e^{-\\frac{r}{V} t}. \\]\nThis is also a first-order linear ODE.

Multiplying both sides by the integrating factor, we get\n\\[ e^{rt} y'(t) + r e^{rt} y(t) = r c V e^{rt} + r C e^{-\\frac{r}{V} t} e^{rt} = r c V e^{rt} + r C e^{rt - \\frac{r}{V} t} = r c V e^{rt} + r C e^{\\frac{r}{V} t}. \\]\nThis simplifies to\n\\[ \\frac{d}{dt} \\left( e^{rt} y(t) \\right) = r c V e^{rt} + r C e^{\\frac{r}{V} t}. \\]\nIntegrating both sides with respect to $t$, we get\n\\[ e^{rt} y(t) = \\int r c V e^{rt} dt + \\int r C e^{\\frac{r}{V} t} dt = r c V \\frac{1}{r} e^{rt} + r C \\frac{V}{r} e^{\\frac{r}{V} t} + D = c V e^{rt} + C V e^{\\frac{r}{V} t} + D. \\]\nThus, $y(t) = c V e^{rt - rt} + C V e^{\\frac{r}{V} t - rt} + D e^{-rt} = c V + C V e^{\\frac{r}{V} t - rt} + D e^{-rt}$.\nSince $y(1) = 0$, we have\n\\[ 0 = c V + C V e^{\\frac{r}{V} - r} + D e^{-r}. \\]\n\\[ 0 = c V + C V e^{r \\left( \\frac{1}{V} - 1 \\right)} + D e^{-r}. \\]\nWe are given that $y(1) = 0$, so we have\n\\[ y(1) = c V + C V e^{\\frac{r}{V} - r} + D e^{-r} = 0. \\]\nWe want to find $y(t)$, so we need to find $C$ and $D$.\nSince $y(1) = 0$, we have\n\\[ c V + C V e^{\\frac{r}{V} - r} + D e^{-r} = 0. \\]\nWe are given that $y(1) = 0$, so we have\n\\[ y'(t) = r x(t) - r y(t). \\]\nWe have $x(t) = c V + C e^{-\\frac{r}{V} t}$.\nThen $y'(t) = r (c V + C e^{-\\frac{r}{V} t}) - r y(t)$.\n\\[ y'(t) + r y(t) = r c V + r C e^{-\\frac{r}{V} t}. \\]\nThe integrating factor is $e^{rt}$.

{"question": "Preamble: In a parallel universe, the Boston baseball team made the playoffs.\n\nSubproblem 0: Manny Relativirez hits the ball and starts running towards first base at speed $\\beta$.
