Then $(1-a) x_{1}+a x_{2} = -1$ becomes $-x_{1}+2 x_{2} = -1$, so $x_{1} = 2 x_{2}+1$. Then $a x_{1}+x_{3} = 1$ becomes $2(2 x_{2}+1)+x_{3} = 1$, so $4 x_{2}+2+x_{3} = 1$, which means $x_{3} = -4 x_{2}-1$.

Then $x_1+2x_2+2(1-2x_1)=0$, so $x_1+2x_2+2-4x_1=0$, so $-3x_1+2x_2=-2$. Also, $2x_1+x_3=1$, so $2x_1+1-2x_1=1$, which is consistent. We have $ax_1+bx_2=2$, so $2x_1+bx_2=2$. Also, $-3x_1+2x_2=-2$. Then $2x_1+bx_2=2$ and $-3x_1+2x_2=-2$. Multiplying the second equation by $b/2$, we get $-3bx_1+b^2x_2=-2b$. Adding this to $2x_1+bx_2=2$, we get $(2-3b/2)x_1+(b^2+b)x_2=2-2b$.\nWe have $\\left|\\begin{array}{lll}a & 0 & 1 \\\\ 1 & a & 1 \\\\ 1 & 2 & a\\end{array}\\right|=4$. Expanding the determinant, we have $a(a^2-2)-1(1-2a)+1(2-a) = a^3-2a-a+2a+a-1 = a^3-1 = 4$, so $a^3=5$, which means $a=\\sqrt[3]{5}$.\nWe want to find $\\left|\\begin{array}{lll}1 & a & 1 \\\\ 1 & 2 & a \\\\ a & b & 0\\end{array}\\right| = 1(2a-ab)-a(1-2a)+1(a-2b) = 2a-ab-a+2a^2+a-2b = 2a^2+2a-ab-2b$.\nFrom $ax_1+bx_2=2$, we have $x_2 = \\frac{2-bx_1}{a}$. From $-3x_1+2x_2=-2$, we have $2x_2 = 3x_1-2$, so $x_2 = \\frac{3x_1-2}{2}$. Thus, $\\frac{2-bx_1}{a} = \\frac{3x_1-2}{2}$, so $4-2bx_1 = a(3x_1-2) = 3ax_1-2a$. Then $3ax_1+2bx_1 = 4+2a$, so $(3a+2b)x_1 = 4+2a$, so $x_1 = \\frac{4+2a}{3a+2b}$.\nThen $x_2 = \\frac{3x_1-2}{2} = \\frac{3(\\frac{4+2a}{3a+2b})-2}{2} = \\frac{\\frac{12+6a}{3a+2b}-2}{2} = \\frac{12+6a-2(3a+2b)}{2(3a+2b)} = \\frac{12+6a-6a-4b}{6a+4b} = \\frac{12-4b}{6a+4b} = \\frac{3-b}{6a+4b}$.\n\nFinal Answer: The final answer is $\\boxed{4}$"], "id": 37, "source": "QA_2023考研数2_mathpix", "generated_answers": ["4"], "gold_answer": "8", "is_correct": false, "answers_correctness": [false]}

Since $f(x_1, x_2, x_3) = 2 \\mathbf{x}^T A \\mathbf{x}$, we have $f(x_1, x_2, x_3) = 2 \\mathbf{x}^T A \\mathbf{x} = 2 \\mathbf{x}^T \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 1 & 1 \\\\ 1 & 0 & 1 \\\\ 1 & 1 & 0 \\end{pmatrix} \\mathbf{x}$.\nThe quadratic form $f(x_1, x_2, x_3) = 2(x_1x_2 + x_2x_3 + x_1x_3)$ can be written as\n$$ f(x_1, x_2, x_3) = 2 \\begin{pmatrix} x_1 & x_2 & x_3 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 1 & 1 \\\\ 1 & 0 & 1 \\\\ 1 & 1 & 0 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} x_1 \\\\ x_2 \\\\ x_3 \\end{pmatrix} $$\nLet $x_1 = 1, x_2 = 1, x_3 = 0$. Then $f(1,1,0) = (1+1)^2 + (1+0)^2 - (0-1)^2 = 4 + 1 - 1 = 4$.\nLet $x_1 = 1, x_2 = -1, x_3 = 0$. Then $f(1,-1,0) = (1-1)^2 + (-1+0)^2 - (0-1)^2 = 0 + 1 - 1 = 0$.\nLet $x_1 = 1, x_2 = 0, x_3 = 0$. Then $f(1,0,0) = (1+0)^2 + (0+0)^2 - (0-1)^2 = 1 + 0 - 1 = 0$.\nLet $x_1 = 1, x_2 = 1, x_3 = -1$. Then $f(1,1,-1) = (1+1)^2 + (1-1)^2 - (-1-1)^2 = 4 + 0 - 4 = 0$.\nLet $x_1 = 1, x_2 = 0, x_3 = 1$. Then $f(1,0,1) = (1+0)^2 + (0+1)^2 - (1-1)^2 = 1 + 1 - 0 = 2$.\nLet $x_1 = 1, x_2 = -1, x_3 = -1$. Then $f(1,-1,-1) = (1-1)^2 + (-1-1)^2 - (-1-1)^2 = 0 + 4 - 4 = 0$.\nSince $f(x_1, x_2, x_3) = 2(x_1x_2 + x_2x_3 + x_1x_3)$, we can see that $f(x_1, x_2, x_3) > 0$ if $x_1x_2 + x_2x_3 + x_1x_3 > 0$.\nConsider $x_1 = 1, x_2 = 1, x_3 = 1$.
