{"question": "Cities $A$ and $B$ are $45$ miles apart. Alicia lives in $A$ and Beth lives in $B$. Alicia bikes towards $B$ at 18 miles per hour. Leaving at the same time, Beth bikes toward $A$ at 12 miles per hour. How many miles from City $A$ will they be when they meet?", "generated_responses": ["Let $d_A$ be the distance from Alicia to the meeting point, and $d_B$ be the distance from Beth to the meeting point. We are given that the total distance between the two cities is 45 miles, so $d_A + d_B = 45$.\nLet $t$ be the time it takes for Alicia and Beth to meet. Since they start at the same time, they will have traveled for the same amount of time.\nAlicia's speed is 18 miles per hour, so the distance Alicia travels is $18t$.\nBeth's speed is 12 miles per hour, so the distance Beth travels is $12t$.\nWe have $d_A = 18t$ and $d_B = 12t$.\nSince $d_A + d_B = 45$, we have $18t + 12t = 45$, which simplifies to $30t = 45$.\nDividing both sides by 30, we get $t = \\frac{45}{30} = \\frac{3}{2}$ hours.\nNow we can find the distance from Alicia to the meeting point:\n$d_A = 18t = 18 \\left(\\frac{3}{2}\\right) = 9 \\cdot 3 = 27$ miles.\nThe distance from Beth to the meeting point is:\n$d_B = 12t = 12 \\left(\\frac{3}{2}\\right) = 6 \\cdot 3 = 18$ miles.\nWe check that $d_A + d_B = 27 + 18 = 45$ miles.\nThe distance from City $A$ to the meeting point is 27 miles.\n\nFinal Answer: The final answer is $\\boxed{27}$"], "id": 0, "generated_answers": ["27"], "gold_answer": "27.0", "is_correct": true, "answers_correctness": [true]}
{"question": "Positive real numbers $x$ and $y$ satisfy $y^3=x^2$ and $(y-x)^2=4y^2$. What is $x+y$?", "generated_responses": ["Let $x$ and $y$ be positive real numbers such that $y^3=x^2$ and $(y-x)^2=4y^2$.\nFrom the second equation, we have $y^2 - 2xy + x^2 = 4y^2$.\nSince $x^2 = y^3$, we can substitute this into the second equation:\n$y^2 - 2xy + y^3 = 4y^2$.\n$y^3 - 2xy + y^2 - 4y^2 = 0$.\n$y^3 - 2xy - 3y^2 = 0$.\nSince $y$ is a positive real number, we can divide by $y$:\n$y^2 - 2x - 3y = 0$.\nWe can rewrite this as $y^2 - 3y - 2x = 0$.\nWe can view this as a quadratic in $y$:\n$y^2 - 3y - 2x = 0$.\nUsing the quadratic formula, we have\n$y = \\frac{3 \\pm \\sqrt{9 - 4(-2x)}}{2} = \\frac{3 \\pm \\sqrt{9+8x}}{2}$.\nSince $x$ and $y$ are positive, we must have $y > 0$. Thus, we take the positive root:\n$y = \\frac{3 + \\sqrt{9+8x}}{2}$.\nWe are given $y^3 = x^2$, so $y = x^{2/3}$.\nSubstituting this into the equation above, we have\n$x^{2/3} = \\frac{3 + \\sqrt{9+8x}}{2}$.\nMultiplying both sides by 2, we get\n$2x^{2/3} = 3 + \\sqrt{9+8x}$.\n$2x^{2/3} - \\sqrt{9+8x} = 3$.\nLet $u = x^{2/3}$. Then $2u - \\sqrt{9+8x} = 3$.\n$2u - 3 = \\sqrt{9+8x}$.\nSquaring both sides, we get\n$(2u-3)^2 = 9+8x$.\n$4u^2 - 12u + 9 = 9+8x$.\n$4u^2 - 12u = 8x$.\n$u^2 - 3u = 2x$.\nSince $u = x^{2/3}$, we have\n$(x^{2/3})^2 - 3x^{2/3} = 2x$.\n$x^{4/3} - 3x^{2/3} = 2x$.\nLet $v = x^{2/3}$.

Then $n = 5k^2$ for some positive integer $k$. Since $n < 2023$, we have $5k^2 < 2023$, so $k^2 < \\frac{2023}{5} = 404.6$. Thus, $k < \\sqrt{404.6} \\approx 20.11$.\nSince $k$ is an integer, we have $1 \\le k \\le 20$.\nWe want to find the number of positive perfect squares less than $2023$ that are divisible by $5$.\nSince $n$ is a perfect square, $5k^2$ must be a perfect square. This means that $k^2$ must be a multiple of $5$, so $k$ must be a multiple of $5$.\nThus, $k$ can be $5, 10, 15, 20$.\nThe corresponding values of $n$ are:\n$5(5^2) = 5(25) = 125$\n$5(10^2) = 5(100) = 500$\n$5(15^2) = 5(225) = 1125$\n$5(20^2) = 5(400) = 2000$\nAll of these are perfect squares less than $2023$ and divisible by $5$.\nThe possible values of $k$ are $5, 10, 15, 20$.\nThe corresponding values of $n$ are $5(5^2) = 125$, $5(10^2) = 500$, $5(15^2) = 1125$, $5(20^2) = 2000$.\nAll of these are perfect squares less than $2023$ and divisible by $5$.\nThe number of possible values of $k$ is $20/5 = 4$.\nThe number of positive perfect squares less than $2023$ that are divisible by $5$ is $4$.\n\nFinal Answer: The final answer is $\\boxed{4}$"], "id": 18, "generated_answers": ["4"], "gold_answer": "8.0", "is_correct": false, "answers_correctness": [false]}

This means that $\\frac{S+11}{n+1} = \\frac{S}{n} + 1$.\nMultiplying both sides by $n(n+1)$, we get $n(S+11) = (n+1)S + n(n+1)$, which simplifies to $nS+11n = nS+S+n^2+n$.\nThus, $11n = S+n^2+n$, so $S = 11n-n^2-n = 10n-n^2$.\nIf Maureen scores an $11$ on each of the next three quizzes, her mean will increase by $2$. This means that $\\frac{S+3(11)}{n+3} = \\frac{S}{n} + 2$.\nMultiplying both sides by $n(n+3)$, we get $n(S+33) = (n+3)S + 2n(n+3)$, which simplifies to $nS+33n = nS+S+2n^2+6n$.\nThus, $33n = S+S+2n^2+6n$, so $27n = 2S+2n^2$.\nSince $S = 10n-n^2$, we have $27n = 2(10n-n^2) + 2n^2$, which simplifies to $27n = 20n-2n^2+2n^2$, so $27n = 20n$.\nThis implies $7n = 0$, so $n=0$.

Then $k$ can be any element of $S$, so $k \\in \\{0, 1, 2, 3, \\cdots, 12\\}$.\nSince $k$ is the minimum element of $B$, we have $k \\in B$.\nWe are given that $|B| = \\min(B) = k$.\nThus, $B$ is a subset of $S$ with $k$ elements, and $k$ is the minimum element of $B$.\nThe other $k-1$ elements of $B$ must be chosen from the elements of $S$ that are greater than $k$.\nThe number of elements in $S$ that are greater than $k$ is $12-k$.\nTherefore, the number of ways to choose $k-1$ elements from $S$ such that $k$ is the minimum element of $B$ is $\\binom{12-k}{k-1}$.\nWe want to find the sum of $\\binom{12-k}{k-1}$ over all possible values of $k$.\nSince $k$ is the minimum element of $B$, we must have $k \\ge 1$.\nAlso, $k$ is the minimum element of $B$, so $k$ is an element of $B$.\nSince $|B| = k$, we have $k$ elements in $B$.\nThe other $k-1$ elements of $B$ must be chosen from the elements of $S$ that are greater than $k$.\nThe number of elements in $S$ that are greater than $k$ is $12-k$.\nTherefore, the number of ways to choose $k-1$ elements from $S$ such that $k$ is the minimum element of $B$ is $\\binom{12-k}{k-1}$.\nWe want to find the sum of $\\binom{12-k}{k-1}$ over all possible values of $k$.\nLet $j = k-1$. Then $k = j+1$, and $j$ can range from $0$ to $11$.\nThe sum is $\\sum_{j=0}^{11} \\binom{12-(j+1)}{j} = \\sum_{j=0}^{11} \\binom{11-j}{j}$.\nWe know that $\\sum_{j=0}^n \\binom{m-j}{j} = \\binom{m+1}{n+1}$.\nIn our case, $m=11$ and $n=11$, so we have $\\sum_{j=0}^{11} \\binom{11-j}{j} = \\binom{11+1}{11+1} = \\binom{12}{12} = 1$.\nHowever, we are looking for nonempty subsets, so we need to consider the case when $k=0$.\nIf $k=0$, then $B$ is a subset of $S$ such that $\\min(B) = 0$. This means that $0 \\in B$.\nThe other $0$ elements of $B$ must be chosen from the elements of $S$ that are greater than $0$.\nThe number of elements in $S$ that are greater than $0$ is $12$.\nTherefore, the number of ways to choose $0$ elements from $S$ such that $0$ is the minimum element of $B$ is $\\binom{12}{0} = 1$.\nThe total number of nonempty subsets $B$ of $S$ such that $|B| = \\min(B)$ is $1 + 1 = 2$.\n\nFinal Answer: The final answer is $\\boxed{2}$"], "id": 48, "generated_answers": ["2"], "gold_answer": "144.0", "is_correct": false, "answers_correctness": [false]}
