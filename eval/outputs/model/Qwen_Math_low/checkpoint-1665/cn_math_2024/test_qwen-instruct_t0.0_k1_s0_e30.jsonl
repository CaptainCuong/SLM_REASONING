Let $\\vec{c}$ be any unit vector such that there exists $t \\in (0,1)$ for which the vector $\\vec{a} + (1-t) \\vec{b}$ is perpendicular to the vector $\\vec{c} - \\vec{a}$. This means that\n$$ (\\vec{a} + (1-t) \\vec{b}) \\cdot (\\vec{c} - \\vec{a}) = 0 $$\n$$ \\vec{a} \\cdot \\vec{c} - \\vec{a} \\cdot \\vec{a} + (1-t) \\vec{b} \\cdot \\vec{c} - (1-t) \\vec{b} \\cdot \\vec{a} = 0 $$\n$$ \\vec{a} \\cdot \\vec{c} - 1 + (1-t) \\vec{b} \\cdot \\vec{c} = 0 $$\n$$ \\vec{a} \\cdot \\vec{c} + (1-t) \\vec{b} \\cdot \\vec{c} = 1 $$\nSince $\\vec{a}$ and $\\vec{b}$ are unit vectors, we have $\\|\\vec{a}\\| = 1$ and $\\|\\vec{b}\\| = 1$. Also, $\\vec{c}$ is a unit vector, so $\\|\\vec{c}\\| = 1$.\nWe want to find the minimum value of $|\\vec{a} + \\vec{b} - \\vec{c}|$.\nWe have\n$$ |\\vec{a} + \\vec{b} - \\vec{c}|^2 = (\\vec{a} + \\vec{b} - \\vec{c}) \\cdot (\\vec{a} + \\vec{b} - \\vec{c}) $$\n$$ = \\vec{a} \\cdot \\vec{a} + \\vec{a} \\cdot \\vec{b} - \\vec{a} \\cdot \\vec{c} + \\vec{b} \\cdot \\vec{a} + \\vec{b} \\cdot \\vec{b} - \\vec{b} \\cdot \\vec{c} - \\vec{c} \\cdot \\vec{a} - \\vec{c} \\cdot \\vec{b} + \\vec{c} \\cdot \\vec{c} $$\n$$ = 1 + 0 - \\vec{a} \\cdot \\vec{c} + 0 + 1 - \\vec{b} \\cdot \\vec{c} - \\vec{c} \\cdot \\vec{a} - \\vec{c} \\cdot \\vec{b} + 1 $$\n$$ = 3 - 2 \\vec{a} \\cdot \\vec{c} - 2 \\vec{b} \\cdot \\vec{c} $$\nWe have $\\vec{a} \\cdot \\vec{c} + (1-t) \\vec{b} \\cdot \\vec{c} = 1$, so $\\vec{a} \\cdot \\vec{c} = 1 - (1-t) \\vec{b} \\cdot \\vec{c}$.\nSubstituting this into the expression for $|\\vec{a} + \\vec{b} - \\vec{c}|^2$, we get\n$$ |\\vec{a} + \\vec{b} - \\vec{c}|^2 = 3 - 2(1 - (1-t) \\vec{b} \\cdot \\vec{c}) - 2 \\vec{b} \\cdot \\vec{c} $$\n$$ = 3 - 2 + 2(1-t) \\vec{b} \\cdot \\vec{c} - 2 \\vec{b} \\cdot \\vec{c} $$\n$$ = 1 + 2(1-t) \\vec{b} \\cdot \\vec{c} - 2 \\vec{b} \\cdot \\vec{c} $$\n$$ = 1 + 2 \\vec{b} \\cdot \\vec{c} - 2t \\vec{b} \\cdot \\vec{c} - 2 \\vec{b} \\cdot \\vec{c} $$\n$$ = 1 - 2t \\vec{b} \\cdot \\vec{c} $$\nSince $\\vec{a} \\cdot \\vec{c} + (1-t) \\vec{b} \\cdot \\vec{c} = 1$, we have $\\vec{a} \\cdot \\vec{c} = 1 - (1-t) \\vec{b} \\cdot \\vec{c}$.\nSince $\\vec{a} \\cdot \\vec{c} \\le 1$, we have $1 - (1-t) \\vec{b} \\cdot \\vec{c} \\le 1$, so $(1-t) \\vec{b} \\cdot \\vec{c} \\ge 0$.\nSince $t \\in (0,1)$, we have $1-t > 0$, so $\\vec{b} \\cdot \\vec{c} \\ge 0$.\nWe want to minimize $|\\vec{a} + \\vec{b} - \\vec{c}|^2 = 1 - 2t \\vec{b} \\cdot \\vec{c}$.\nSince $\\vec{b} \\cdot \\vec{c} \\ge 0$, we want to maximize $\\vec{b} \\cdot \\vec{c}$.\nWe have $\\vec{a} \\cdot \\vec{c} + (1-t) \\vec{b} \\cdot \\vec{c} = 1$.\nSince $\\vec{a} \\cdot \\vec{c} \\le 1$, we have $(1-t) \\vec{b} \\cdot \\vec{c} \\ge 0$.\nWe want to maximize $\\vec{b} \\cdot \\vec{c}$.\nIf $\\vec{a} \\cdot \\vec{c} = 1$, then $(1-t) \\vec{b} \\cdot \\vec{c} = 0$, so $\\vec{b} \\cdot \\vec{c} = 0$.\nThen $|\\vec{a} + \\vec{b} - \\vec{c}|^2 = 1 - 2t(0) = 1$, so $|\\vec{a} + \\vec{b} - \\vec{c}| = 1$.\nIf $\\vec{a} \\cdot \\vec{c} < 1$, then $\\vec{b} \\cdot \\vec{c} > 0$.\nWe want to maximize $\\vec{b} \\cdot \\vec{c}$.\nIf $\\vec{a} \\cdot \\vec{c} = 0$, then $(1-t) \\vec{b} \\cdot \\vec{c} = 1$, so $\\vec{b} \\cdot \\vec{c} = \\frac{1}{1-t}$.\nThen $|\\vec{a} + \\vec{b} - \\vec{c}|^2 = 1 - 2t \\left(\\frac{1}{1-t}\\right) = 1 - \\frac{2t}{1-t} = \\frac{1-t-2t}{1-t} = \\frac{1-3t}{1-t}$.\nWe want to minimize $\\frac{1-3t}{1-t}$.\nLet $f(t) = \\frac{1-3t}{1-t}$.
