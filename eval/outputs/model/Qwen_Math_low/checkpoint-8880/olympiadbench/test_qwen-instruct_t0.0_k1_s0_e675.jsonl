Then $r \\times c = k$, the number of divisors of $n$. Let $S$ be the sum of the divisors of $n$. Then the sum of each row is $S/r$ and the sum of each column is $S/c$. Since the sums of all rows are equal and the sums of all columns are equal, we must have $S/r = S/c$, which implies $r=c$. Therefore, the table is a square.\n\nLet $n = p_1^{a_1} p_2^{a_2} \\dots p_m^{a_m}$ be the prime factorization of $n$. Then the number of divisors of $n$ is $k = (a_1+1)(a_2+1)\\dots(a_m+1)$.

Since $D(x, y)$ is an integer, the possible values of $D(x, y)$ are $0, 1, 2, \\dots$.\nWe are given that each member $x$ of $\\mathcal{F}$ has at most $k$ different scales in $\\mathcal{F}$.\nLet $n$ be the size of $\\mathcal{F}$. Then $n-1$ is the number of other elements in $\\mathcal{F}$.\nSince each member has at most $k$ different scales, we have $n-1 \\leq k$.\nThus, $n \\leq k+1$.\n\nWe can construct a set $\\mathcal{F}$ of size $k+1$ such that each member has exactly $k$ different scales.\nLet $x_1, x_2, \\dots, x_{k+1}$ be the elements of $\\mathcal{F}$.\nWe want to choose the elements such that $D(x_i, x_j) \\neq D(x_i, x_k)$ for $i \\neq j$ and $i \\neq k$.\nWe can choose $x_1$ to be any real number.\nThen $x_2$ must be such that $D(x_1, x_2) = 0$.\nThen $x_3$ must be such that $D(x_1, x_3) = 0$ and $D(x_2, x_3) = 0$.\nWe can choose $x_1 = 0$. Then $x_2$ must satisfy $2^0 \\leq |x_2| < 2^1$, so $1 \\leq |x_2| < 2$. Let $x_2 = 1$.\nThen $x_3$ must satisfy $2^0 \\leq |x_3| < 2^1$ and $2^0 \\leq |x_3-1| < 2^1$.\nSo $1 \\leq |x_3| < 2$ and $1 \\leq |x_3-1| < 2$.\nThis means $1 \\leq x_3 < 2$ and $1 \\leq x_3-1 < 2$, so $1 \\leq x_3 < 2$ and $2 \\leq x_3 < 3$.\nThis is impossible.\nInstead, we can choose $x_1 = 0$. Then $x_2$ must satisfy $1 \\leq |x_2| < 2$. Let $x_2 = 1$.\nThen $x_3$ must satisfy $1 \\leq |x_3| < 2$ and $1 \\leq |x_3-1| < 2$.\nSo $1 \\leq x_3 < 2$ and $1 \\leq x_3-1 < 2$, which means $1 \\leq x_3 < 2$ and $2 \\leq x_3 < 3$.\nThis is impossible.\n\nLet $x_1 = 0$. Then $x_2$ must satisfy $2^d \\leq |x_2| < 2^{d+1}$ for some integer $d$.\nLet $x_2 = 1$. Then $x_3$ must satisfy $2^d \\leq |x_3| < 2^{d+1}$ and $2^d \\leq |x_3-1| < 2^{d+1}$.\nIf $x_3 > 0$, then $2^d \\leq x_3 < 2^{d+1}$ and $2^d \\leq x_3-1 < 2^{d+1}$.\nSo $2^d+1 \\leq x_3 < 2^{d+1}+1$. We need $2^d \\leq x_3 < 2^{d+1}$ and $2^d+1 \\leq x_3 < 2^{d+1}+1$.\nThen $2^d+1 \\leq x_3 < 2^{d+1}$.\nIf $x_3 < 0$, then $2^d \\leq -x_3 < 2^{d+1}$ and $2^d \\leq -x_3+1 < 2^{d+1}$.\nSo $-2^{d+1} < x_3 \\leq -2^d$ and $-2^{d+1}+1 < x_3 \\leq -2^d+1$.\nWe need $-2^{d+1} < x_3 \\leq -2^d$ and $-2^{d+1}+1 < x_3 \\leq -2^d+1$.\nThen $-2^{d+1}+1 < x_3 \\leq -2^d$.\n\nIf we choose $x_1 = 0$, $x_2 = 1$, $x_3 = 2$, then $D(0, 1) = 0$, $D(0, 2) = 1$, $D(1, 2) = 0$.\nIf we choose $x_1 = 0$, $x_2 = 1$, $x_3 = 3$, then $D(0, 1) = 0$, $D(0, 3) = 2$, $D(1, 3) = 1$.\nIf we choose $x_1 = 0$, $x_2 = 1$, $x_3 = 4$, then $D(0, 1) = 0$, $D(0, 4) = 3$, $D(1, 4) = 2$.\n\nConsider the set $\\{0, 1, 2, \\dots, k\\}$. The number of scales is $k+1$.\nIf we choose $x=0$, then $D(0, y) = \\lfloor \\log_2 |y| \\rfloor$.\nIf we choose $x=1$, then $D(1, y) = \\lfloor \\log_2 |y-1| \\rfloor$.\n\nThe maximum possible size of $\\mathcal{F}$ is $2^k$.\n\nFinal Answer: The final answer is $\\boxed{2^k}$"], "id": 1920, "generated_answers": ["2^k"], "gold_answer": "$2^{k}$", "is_correct": true, "answers_correctness": [true]}

So $C_1 = (i, j_1)$, $C_2 = (i, j_1)$, $C_3 = (i, k)$.\nSince $C_1$ and $C_3$ are white, and $C_2$ is red, we have $C_1 = (i, j_1)$, $C_2 = (i, j_1)$, $C_3 = (i, k)$ where $C_1$ and $C_3$ are white and $C_2$ is red.\nThe number of choices for $i$ is 999.

Then $B = 90-2(30) = 30$, and $A = 30-30 = 0$.\nThis means we don't use any mixture from bottle A.\nThe mass of acid in the first mixture is $0.10(0) + 0.20(30) + 0.30(30) = 0 + 6 + 9 = 15$.\nThe mass of the first mixture is $0+30+30 = 60$.\nThe percentage of acid in the first mixture is $\\frac{15}{60} \\times 100 = 25\\%$.\nNow we have $40-0=40$ g of mixture from bottle A, $50-30=20$ g of mixture from bottle B, and $50-30=20$ g of mixture from bottle C.\nThe total mass of the remaining mixture is $40+20+20 = 80$.\nThe mass of acid in the remaining mixture is $0.10(40) + 0.20(20) + 0.30(20) = 4 + 4 + 6 = 14$.\nThe percentage of acid in the remaining mixture is $\\frac{14}{80} \\times 100 = \\frac{140}{8} = \\frac{70}{4} = \\frac{35}{2} = 17.5\\%$.\n\nNow we write out the argument and find the final answer.\nLet $A, B, C$ be the amounts of mixture from bottles A, B, and C used to create the first mixture, respectively. We have $A+B+C = 60$ and $0.10A + 0.20B + 0.30C = 0.25(60) = 15$.\nWe have $A = 60-B-C$, so $0.10(60-B-C) + 0.20B + 0.30C = 15$.\n$6 - 0.10B - 0.10C + 0.20B + 0.30C = 15$.\n$0.10B + 0.20C = 9$.\n$B + 2C = 90$.\n$B = 90 - 2C$.\nSubstituting into $A+B+C = 60$, we have $A + (90-2C) + C = 60$, so $A = 60 - 90 + C = C-30$.\nSince $A \\ge 0$, we have $C \\ge 30$.\nAlso, $B = 90-2C \\ge 0$, so $2C \\le 90$, which means $C \\le 45$.\nSo $30 \\le C \\le 45$.\nLet $C=30$. Then $B = 90-2(30) = 30$, and $A = 30-30 = 0$.\nThe mass of acid in the first mixture is $0.10(0) + 0.20(30) + 0.30(30) = 0+6+9 = 15$.\nThe mass of the first mixture is $0+30+30 = 60$.\nThe percentage of acid in the first mixture is $\\frac{15}{60} \\times 100 = 25\\%$.\nThe remaining mixture has $40-0=40$ g from A, $50-30=20$ g from B, and $50-30=20$ g from C.\nThe total mass is $40+20+20 = 80$.\nThe mass of acid is $0.10(40) + 0.20(20) + 0.30(20) = 4+4+6 = 14$.\nThe percentage of acid in the remaining mixture is $\\frac{14}{80} \\times 100 = \\frac{140}{8} = \\frac{70}{4} = \\frac{35}{2} = 17.5\\%$.\n\nFinal Answer: The final answer is $\\boxed{17.5}$"], "id": 2341, "generated_answers": ["17.5"], "gold_answer": "17.5%", "is_correct": true, "answers_correctness": [true]}

Thus, $-223 < m < 223$.\nWe need $m$ to be such that $n = 2m^2 - 2$ is a positive integer. Since $m^2 > 1$, we must have $m > 1$ or $m < -1$. Since $m$ is an integer, we must have $m \\ge 2$ or $m \\le -2$.\nWe want $m$ such that $2 \\le m \\le 222$.\nThe number of possible values for $m$ is $222 - 2 + 1 = 221$.\nFor each value of $m$, we have a corresponding value of $n = 2m^2 - 2$. Since $2 \\le m \\le 222$, we have $n = 2m^2 - 2 \\ge 2(2^2) - 2 = 8-2=6$. Also, $n = 2m^2 - 2 \\le 2(222^2) - 2 = 2(49284) - 2 = 98568 - 2 = 98566$.\nSince $n=6$, we have $AB = 6(7) = 42$ and $AC = 7(11) = 77$. Then $BC = \\sqrt{77^2 - 42^2} = \\sqrt{5929 - 1764} = \\sqrt{4165} = \\sqrt{5 \\cdot 833} = \\sqrt{5 \\cdot 19 \\cdot 43}$, which is not an integer.\nWe want $BC = (n+1) 2\\sqrt{2(n+2)}$ to be an integer. This means $2(n+2)$ must be a perfect square. Let $2(n+2) = k^2$. Then $n+2 = \\frac{k^2}{2}$, so $n = \\frac{k^2}{2} - 2$. Since $n$ is an integer, $k$ must be even. Let $k=2m$. Then $n = \\frac{(2m)^2}{2} - 2 = 2m^2 - 2$.\nWe need $n$ to be a positive integer, so $2m^2 - 2 > 0$, which means $m^2 > 1$, so $m > 1$ or $m < -1$. Since $m$ is an integer, we have $m \\ge 2$ or $m \\le -2$.\nWe also need $n < 100000$, so $2m^2 - 2 < 100000$, which means $2m^2 < 100002$, so $m^2 < 50001$. Thus, $-223 < m < 223$.\nCombining these conditions, we have $2 \\le m \\le 222$.

Since $a$ and $b$ are integers, $\\sqrt{ab}$ must be an integer. Let $\\sqrt{ab} = k$, where $k$ is an integer. Then $ab = k^2$.\nSo, $a+b = 50-2k$.\nWe have $a+b = 50-2k$ and $ab = k^2$. Thus, $a$ and $b$ are the roots of the quadratic equation $x^2 - (50-2k)x + k^2 = 0$.\nFor $a$ and $b$ to be integers, the discriminant of this quadratic equation must be a perfect square.\nThe discriminant is $(50-2k)^2 - 4(k^2) = 2500 - 200k + 4k^2 - 4k^2 = 2500 - 200k$.\nWe need $2500 - 200k$ to be a perfect square, say $m^2$, where $m$ is an integer.\nSo $2500 - 200k = m^2$.

Then $b = a+d$ and $c = a+2d$ for some common difference $d$. Since $a+b+c=60$, we have $a + (a+d) + (a+2d) = 60$, which simplifies to $3a+3d = 60$, or $a+d = 20$. Thus, $b = 20$.\nThe geometric sequence is $a-2, b, c+3$. Since $b=20$, the geometric sequence is $a-2, 20, c+3$. The ratio between the second and first term is $\\frac{20}{a-2}$, and the ratio between the third and second term is $\\frac{c+3}{20}$. Since the sequence is geometric, we have $\\frac{20}{a-2} = \\frac{c+3}{20}$. Thus, $20^2 = (a-2)(c+3)$, so $400 = (a-2)(a+2d+3)$. Since $b = a+d = 20$, we have $d = 20-a$. Substituting this into the equation above, we get\n$400 = (a-2)(a+2(20-a)+3) = (a-2)(a+40-2a+3) = (a-2)(43-a) = 43a - a^2 - 86 + 2a = -a^2 + 45a - 86$.\nThus, $a^2 - 45a + 86 = 0$. We can factor this quadratic as $(a-2)(a-43) = 0$. So $a=2$ or $a=43$.\nIf $a=2$, then $d = 20-2 = 18$. Then $b=20$ and $c = 2+2(18) = 2+36 = 38$.\nIf $a=43$, then $d = 20-43 = -23$. Then $b=20$ and $c = 43+2(-23) = 43-46 = -3$.\nWe check that $a, b, c$ form an arithmetic sequence, and $a+b+c=60$.\nIf $a=2, b=20, c=38$, then $2, 20, 38$ is an arithmetic sequence with $a=2, b=20, c=38$.\nIf $a=43, b=20, c=-3$, then $43, 20, -3$ is an arithmetic sequence with $a=43, b=20, c=-3$.\nNow we check that $a-2, b, c+3$ form a geometric sequence.\nIf $a=2, b=20, c=38$, then $a-2=0, b=20, c+3=41$. This is not a geometric sequence since $20/0$ is undefined.\nIf $a=43, b=20, c=-3$, then $a-2=41, b=20, c+3=0$. This is not a geometric sequence since $20/41$ is not equal to $0/20$.\nLet's recheck the quadratic equation.\n$a^2 - 45a + 86 = 0$.\nUsing the quadratic formula, $a = \\frac{45 \\pm \\sqrt{45^2 - 4(1)(86)}}{2} = \\frac{45 \\pm \\sqrt{2025 - 344}}{2} = \\frac{45 \\pm \\sqrt{1681}}{2} = \\frac{45 \\pm 41}{2}$.\nSo $a = \\frac{45+41}{2} = \\frac{86}{2} = 43$ or $a = \\frac{45-41}{2} = \\frac{4}{2} = 2$.\nIf $a=2$, then $b=20$, $c=38$. The geometric sequence is $0, 20, 41$. The ratio is $20/0$, which is undefined.\nIf $a=43$, then $b=20$, $c=-3$. The geometric sequence is $41, 20, 0$. The ratio is $20/41$, which is not $0/20$.\nThe problem states that the numbers $a, b, c$ are distinct.\nIf $a=2, b=20, c=38$, then $a, b, c$ are distinct. However, $a-2=0, b=20, c+3=41$. The ratios are $20/0$ and $41/20$, which are not equal.\nIf $a=43, b=20, c=-3$, then $a, b, c$ are distinct. However, $a-2=41, b=20, c+3=0$. The ratios are $20/41$ and $0/20$, which are not equal.\nWe have $a+b+c = 60$ and $b=20$. So $a+c = 40$.\nAlso, $a-2, b, c+3$ is a geometric sequence. So $\\frac{b}{a-2} = \\frac{c+3}{b}$.\nThus $b^2 = (a-2)(c+3)$. Since $b=20$, $20^2 = 400 = (a-2)(c+3)$.\nSince $c = 40-a$, $400 = (a-2)(40-a+3) = (a-2)(43-a) = 43a - a^2 - 86 + 2a = -a^2 + 45a - 86$.\nSo $a^2 - 45a + 86 = 0$. $(a-2)(a-43) = 0$.\nIf $a=2$, then $c = 40-2 = 38$. The sequences are $2, 20, 38$ and $0, 20, 41$. This doesn't work.\nIf $a=43$, then $c = 40-43 = -3$. The sequences are $43, 20, -3$ and $41, 20, 0$. This doesn't work.\n\nLet's reconsider the problem.\n$a, b, c$ is an arithmetic sequence, so $b = a+d$ and $c = a+2d$. Also, $a+b+c = 60$, so $a + (a+d) + (a+2d) = 3a+3d = 60$, which means $a+d = 20$. Thus $b=20$.\n$a-2, b, c+3$ is a geometric sequence, so $\\frac{b}{a-2} = \\frac{c+3}{b}$. Since $b=20$, we have $\\frac{20}{a-2} = \\frac{c+3}{20}$, so $20^2 = (a-2)(c+3)$, which means $400 = (a-2)(c+3)$.\nSince $b=20$, we have $c = b-d = 20-d$. Substituting this into the equation above, we get\n$400 = (a-2)(20-d+3) = (a-2)(23-d) = 23a - ad - 46 + 2d$.\nSo $a^2 - (23+d)a + 46 - 2d = 0$.\nWe also have $a+d = 20$, so $d = 20-a$. Substituting this into the equation above, we get\n$400 = (a-2)(23-(20-a)) = (a-2)(3+a) = 3a+a^2-6-2a = a^2+a-6$.\nSo $a^2+a-406 = 0$. $(a-19)(a+21) = 0$. So $a=19$ or $a=-21$.\nIf $a=19$, then $d = 20-19 = 1$. Then $b=20$ and $c = 19+2(1) = 21$.\nThe sequences are $19, 20, 21$ and $17, 20, 24$. The ratio is $\\frac{20}{17} = \\frac{24}{20}$.\nIf $a=-21$, then $d = 20-(-21) = 41$. Then $b=20$ and $c = -21+2(41) = 61$.\nThe sequences are $-21, 20, 61$ and $-19, 20, 64$.

Since $d(d-1) = 2n$, $d$ and $d-1$ are integers, so $2n$ must be an integer. Also, $1+8n$ must be a perfect square, say $k^2$, where $k$ is an integer. Then $1+8n = k^2$, so $8n = k^2 - 1 = (k-1)(k+1)$. Thus, $n = \\frac{(k-1)(k+1)}{8}$.\nSince $n$ is the number of residents, $n$ must be a positive integer. Therefore, $k$ must be odd. Let $k = 2m+1$ for some integer $m$. Then $1+8n = (2m+1)^2 = 4m^2 + 4m + 1$, so $8n = 4m^2 + 4m$, which means $2n = m^2 + m = m(m+1)$.

Also, $n$ is the number of residents, so $n$ must be an integer.\nWe have $d^2 - d - 2n = 0$.

{"question": "In ARMLopolis, every house number is a positive integer, and City Hall's address is 0. However, due to the curved nature of the cowpaths that eventually became the streets of ARMLopolis, the distance $d(n)$ between house $n$ and City Hall is not simply the value of $n$. Instead, if $n=3^{k} n^{\\prime}$, where $k \\geq 0$ is an integer and $n^{\\prime}$ is an integer not divisible by 3 , then $d(n)=3^{-k}$. For example, $d(18)=1 / 9$ and $d(17)=1$. Notice that even though no houses have negative numbers, $d(n)$ is well-defined for negative values of $n$. For example, $d(-33)=1 / 3$ because $-33=3^{1} \\cdot-11$. By definition, $d(0)=0$.

In particular, if $m=n$, then $d(m, n)=0$.\n\n\nThe neighborhood of a house $n$, written $\\mathcal{N}(n)$, is the set of all houses that are the same distance from City Hall as $n$. In symbols, $\\mathcal{N}(n)=\\{m \\mid d(m)=d(n)\\}$. Geometrically, it may be helpful to think of $\\mathcal{N}(n)$ as a circle centered at City Hall with radius $d(n)$.\n\n\nUnfortunately for new development, ARMLopolis is full: every nonnegative integer corresponds to (exactly one) house (or City Hall, in the case of 0). However, eighteen families arrive and are looking to move in. After much debate, the connotations of using negative house numbers are deemed unacceptable, and the city decides on an alternative plan. On July 17, Shewad Movers arrive and relocate every family from house $n$ to house $n+18$, for all positive $n$ (so that City Hall does not move). For example, the family in house number 17 moves to house number 35.\nRoss takes a walk starting at his house, which is number 34 . He first visits house $n_{1}$, such that $d\\left(n_{1}, 34\\right)=1 / 3$. He then goes to another house, $n_{2}$, such that $d\\left(n_{1}, n_{2}\\right)=1 / 3$. Continuing in that way, he visits houses $n_{3}, n_{4}, \\ldots$, and each time, $d\\left(n_{i}, n_{i+1}\\right)=1 / 3$.

{"question": "Let $T=T N Y W R$. Compute the number of positive perfect cubes that are divisors of $(T+10) !$.", "generated_responses": ["To solve the problem, we need to determine the number of positive perfect cubes that are divisors of \\((T+10)!\\) where \\(T = 1000000000\\).\n\n### Step 1: Understanding the Problem\nFirst, let's understand the factorial expression \\((T+10)!\\). The factorial of a number \\(n\\), denoted \\(n!\\), is the product of all positive integers up to \\(n\\). Therefore, \\((T+10)!\\) is the product of all positive integers from 1 to \\(T+10\\).\n\n### Step 2: Prime Factorization of \\((T+10)!\\)\nTo find the number of perfect cubes that divide \\((T+10)!\\), we need to consider the prime factorization of \\((T+10)!\\). The prime factorization of a factorial is a product of all prime numbers less than or equal to \\(T+10\\), each raised to a certain power.\n\n### Step 3: Counting the Perfect Cubes\nA perfect cube is a number that can be expressed as \\(a^3\\) where \\(a\\) is an integer. For a number to be a perfect cube, each exponent in its prime factorization must be a multiple of 3.\n\n### Step 4: Determining the Exponents\nFor each prime number \\(p\\) less than or equal to \\(T+10\\), we need to count how many times \\(p\\) appears in the factorization of \\((T+10)!\\). This is given by the sum of the integer divisions of \\(T+10\\) by powers of \\(p\\):\n\n\\[\n\\sum_{k=1}^{\\infty} \\left\\lfloor \\frac{T+10}{p^k} \\right\\rfloor\n\\]\n\n### Step 5: Simplifying the Count\nSince \\(T = 1000000000\\), \\(T+10 = 1000000010\\). We need to count the number of perfect cubes that divide \\(1000000010!\\).\n\n### Step 6: Using the Formula for Perfect Cubes\nThe number of perfect cubes that divide \\(n!\\) is given by the product of the exponents in the prime factorization of \\(n!\\) divided by 3, plus 1 for each prime factor. This is because each exponent in the prime factorization of \\(n!\\) must be a multiple of 3 for the number to be a perfect cube.\n\n### Step 7: Applying the Formula\nFor \\(T+10 = 1000000010\\), we need to count the number of perfect cubes that divide \\(1000000010!\\). The prime factorization of \\(1000000010\\) is:\n\n\\[\n1000000010 = 2 \\times 5 \\times 100000001\n\\]\n\nWe need to count the number of perfect cubes that divide \\(1000000010!\\). The number of perfect cubes is:\n\n\\[\n\\left\\lfloor \\frac{1000000010}{2} \\right\\rfloor \\times \\left\\lfloor \\frac{1000000010}{3} \\right\\rfloor \\times \\left\\lfloor \\frac{1000000010}{5} \\right\\rfloor \\times \\left\\lfloor \\frac{1000000010}{7} \\right\\rfloor \\times \\cdots\n\\]\n\n### Step 8: Simplifying the Calculation\nSince \\(1000000010\\) is a large number, we can approximate the number of perfect cubes by considering the prime factorization and the exponents.

We need to find the possible values of $L A$.\nBy the triangle inequality, in $\\triangle A R M$, we have:\n$A M - A R < R M < A M + A R$\n$32 - 20 < 23 < 32 + 20$\n$12 < 23 < 52$\nThis inequality is satisfied.\nBy the triangle inequality, in $\\triangle R M L$, we have:\n$R L - R M < M L < R L + R M$\n$R L - 23 < 25 < R L + 23$\n$R L - 23 < 25 \\implies R L < 48$\n$25 < R L + 23 \\implies 2 < R L$\nSo $2 < R L < 48$.\nBy the triangle inequality, in $\\triangle M L A$, we have:\n$M A - M L < L A < M A + M L$\n$M A - 25 < L A < M A + 25$\nBy the triangle inequality, in $\\triangle A L R$, we have:\n$A R - A L < L R < A R + A L$\n$20 - A L < L R < 20 + A L$\nSince $R L = L R$, we have $20 - A L < R L < 20 + A L$.\nCombining the inequalities, we have $2 < R L < 48$ and $20 - A L < R L < 20 + A L$.\nThus, we have $\\max(2, 20 - A L) < R L < \\min(48, 20 + A L)$.\nSince $R L$ is a length, $R L > 0$.\nWe have $20 - A L < R L < 20 + A L$.\nSince $R L < 48$, we have $20 + A L < 48$, so $A L < 28$.\nAlso, $20 - A L > 2$, so $A L < 18$.\nSince $R L > 0$, we have $20 - A L > 0$, so $A L < 20$.\nAlso, $R L < 20 + A L$, so $R L - A L < 20$.\n$P = A R + R M + M L + L A = 20 + 23 + 25 + L A = 68 + L A$.\nWe have $A L < 28$, so $P < 68 + 28 = 96$.\nAlso, $R L > 2$, so $L A > R L - 23 > 2 - 23 = -21$. Thus $L A > -21$.\nSince $L A$ is a length, $L A > 0$.\nAlso, $R L < 48$, so $L A < 48 - 20 = 28$.\nSo $0 < L A < 28$.\nThe perimeter is $P = 68 + L A$.\nSince $L A$ is an integer, $P$ is an integer.\nThe possible values of $L A$ are $1, 2, \\dots, 27$.\nThe possible values of $P$ are $69, 70, \\dots, 68 + 27 = 95$.\nThe number of possible values for $P$ is $95 - 69 + 1 = 27$.\nHowever, we need to consider the triangle inequalities.\nIn $\\triangle A R M$, $A M - A R < R M < A M + A R$, so $32 - 20 < 23 < 32 + 20$, which is $12 < 23 < 52$.\nIn $\\triangle R M L$, $R L - R M < M L < R L + R M$, so $R L - 23 < 25 < R L + 23$, which is $R L - 23 < 25 \\implies R L < 48$ and $25 < R L + 23 \\implies 2 < R L$.\nIn $\\triangle M L A$, $M A - M L < L A < M A + M L$, so $M A - 25 < L A < M A + 25$.\nIn $\\triangle A L R$, $A R - A L < L R < A R + A L$, so $20 - A L < L R < 20 + A L$.\nSince $L R = R L$, we have $20 - A L < R L < 20 + A L$.\nThus, we have $\\max(2, 20 - A L) < R L < \\min(48, 20 + A L)$.\nWe need to find the number of possible values for $L A$.\nWe have $R L < 48$, so $20 + A L < 48$, which means $A L < 28$.\nAlso, $R L > 2$, so $20 - A L > 2$, which means $A L < 18$.\nAlso, $R L > 0$, so $20 - A L > 0$, which means $A L < 20$.\nSo $A L < 18$.\nThe possible values for $L A$ are $1, 2, \\dots, 17$.\nThe perimeter is $P = 68 + L A$, so the possible values for $P$ are $69, 70, \\dots, 68 + 17 = 85$.\nThe number of possible values for $P$ is $85 - 69 + 1 = 17$.\nHowever, we need to consider the triangle inequalities.\nWe have $A R = 20, R M = 23, M L = 25, A M = 32$.\nBy the triangle inequality, $A R + R M > A M$, $20 + 23 > 32$, $43 > 32$.\n$R M + M L > R L$, $23 + 25 > R L$, $48 > R L$.\n$M L + L A > M A$, $25 + L A > 32$, $L A > 7$.\n$A R + R L > A L$, $20 + R L > A L$.\n$A L < 20 + R L < 20 + 48 = 68$.\nSo $7 < A L < 68$.\nThe possible integer values for $A L$ are $8, 9, \\dots, 67$.\nThe number of possible values for $A L$ is $67 - 8 + 1 = 60$.\nThe perimeter is $P = 68 + L A$, so the possible values for $P$ are $68 + 8 = 76$ to $68 + 67 = 135$.\nThe number of possible values for $P$ is $60$.\nThe possible values for $L A$ are integers such that $7 < L A < 68$.\nThe number of integers in the range $8 \\le L A \\le 67$ is $67 - 8 + 1 = 60$.\nTherefore, there are 60 possible values for $L A$.\nThe possible values of the perimeter are $68 + L A$ for $8 \\le L A \\le 67$.\nSo the possible values of the perimeter are $76, 77, \\dots, 135$.\nThe number of possible values for the perimeter is $135 - 76 + 1 = 60$.\n\nHowever, we need to consider the triangle inequality.\nThe triangle inequality states that the sum of any two sides of a triangle must be greater than the third side.\nLet $L A = x$.\nThen we have:\n$A R + R M > A M \\implies 20 + 23 > 32 \\implies 43 > 32$ (True)\n$R M + M L > R L \\implies 23 + 25 > R L \\implies 48 > R L$\n$M L + L A > M A \\implies 25 + x > 32 \\implies x > 7$\n$A R + R L > A L \\implies 20 + R L > x$\nSince $R L < 48$, we have $20 + R L < 68$.\nSo $x < 68$.\nAlso, $x > 7$.\nSo $7 < x < 68$.\nThe possible integer values for $x$ are $8, 9, \\dots, 67$.\nThe number of possible values for $x$ is $67 - 8 + 1 = 60$.\nThe perimeter is $P = 68 + x$, so the possible values for $P$ are $68 + 8 = 76$ to $68 + 67 = 135$.\nThe number of possible values for $P$ is $60$.\n\nThe answer is 60.\nThe question asks for the number of different integers that could be the perimeter of $A R M L$.\nThe perimeter is $P = A R + R M + M L + L A = 20 + 23 + 25 + L A = 68 + L A$.\nWe need to find the possible values of $L A$.\nBy the triangle inequality, we have:\n$A R + R M > A M \\implies 20 + 23 > 32 \\implies 43 > 32$ (True)\n$R M + M L > R L \\implies 23 + 25 > R L \\implies 48 > R L$\n$M L + L A > M A \\implies 25 + L A > 32 \\implies L A > 7$\n$A R + R L > A L \\implies 20 + R L > L A$\nSince $R L < 48$, we have $20 + R L < 68$.\nSo $L A < 68$.\nAlso, $L A > 7$.\nThe possible integer values for $L A$ are $8, 9, \\dots, 67$.\nThe number of possible values for $L A$ is $67 - 8 + 1 = 60$.\nThe perimeter is $P = 68 + L A$, so the possible values for $P$ are $68 + 8 = 76$ to $68 + 67 =

Thus, $10A(x) - x^2 - 10x$ must be a polynomial. Since $A(x)$ is a polynomial, $10A(x)$ is a polynomial. Also, $x^2+10x$ is a polynomial. Thus, $10A(x) - x^2 - 10x$ is a polynomial.\nSince $B(x)$ is a polynomial, we must have $10A(x) - x^2 - 10x \\neq 0$ for all $x$ such that $A(x) \\neq 0$.\nAlso, we are given that $A(x)$ has leading coefficient 1.\nLet $A(x) = x^n + a_{n-1}x^{n-1} + \\dots + a_1x + a_0$.\nThen $10A(x) = 10x^n + 10a_{n-1}x^{n-1} + \\dots + 10a_1x + 10a_0$.\n$10A(x) - x^2 - 10x = 10x^n + 10a_{n-1}x^{n-1} + \\dots + 10a_1x + 10a_0 - x^2 - 10x$.\nIf $n \\geq 2$, then $10A(x) - x^2 - 10x$ is a polynomial of degree $n$.\nIf $n=1$, then $10A(x) - x^2 - 10x = 10x+10a_0 - x^2 - 10x = -x^2 + 10a_0$.\nIf $n=0$, then $10A(x) - x^2 - 10x = 10a_0 - x^2 - 10x$.\nSince $B(x)$ is a polynomial, we must have $10A(x) - x^2 - 10x \\neq 0$ for all $x$.\nIf $n \\geq 2$, then $10A(x) - x^2 - 10x$ is a polynomial of degree $n$. Thus, it has $n$ roots.\nIf $n=1$, then $10A(x) - x^2 - 10x = -x^2 + 10a_0$. If $a_0 = 0$, then $B(x) = \\frac{x(x+10)}{x^2+10x} = 1$, which is a polynomial. Then $A(x) = x$, $B(x) = 1$, and $x \\neq -10, 0$.\nIf $n=0$, then $10A(x) - x^2 - 10x = 10a_0 - x^2 - 10x$. This is a quadratic.\nIf $A(x) = x^2$, then $B(x) = \\frac{x(x+10)}{10x^2 - x^2 - 10x} = \\frac{x(x+10)}{9x^2 - 10x} = \\frac{x+10}{9x-10}$, which is not a polynomial.\nIf $A(x) = x^2+ax+b$, then $B(x) = \\frac{x(x+10)(x^2+ax+b)}{10(x^2+ax+b) - x^2 - 10x} = \\frac{x(x+10)(x^2+ax+b)}{9x^2 + 10ax + 10b - x^2 - 10x} = \\frac{x(x+10)(x^2+ax+b)}{8x^2 + 10ax + 10b - 10x}$.\nFor $B(x)$ to be a polynomial, we need $8x^2 + 10ax + 10b - 10x = 0$ for all $x$. This implies $8=0$, $10a=0$, and $10b-10=0$.\nThus, $a=0$, $b=1$, and $B(x) = \\frac{x(x+10)}{8x^2 - 10x + 10} = \\frac{x(x+10)}{2(4x^2 - 5x + 5)}$.\nSince $B(x)$ is not a polynomial, we must have $A(x) = x$.\nThen $B(x) = \\frac{x(x+10)}{10x - x^2 - 10x} = \\frac{x(x+10)}{-x^2} = \\frac{x+10}{-x} = -1 - \\frac{10}{x}$, which is not a polynomial.\nLet $A(x) = x^2+ax+b$.

This implies $8=0$, $10a=0$, and $10b-10=0$.\nThus $a=0$, $b=1$. Then $A(x) = x^2+1$.\n$B(x) = \\frac{x(x+10)}{10(x^2+1) - x^2 - 10x} = \\frac{x(x+10)}{10x^2+10 - x^2 - 10x} = \\frac{x(x+10)}{9x^2 - 10x + 10}$.\nIf $A(x) = x^2+ax+b$, then $B(x) = \\frac{x(x+10)(x^2+ax+b)}{10(x^2+ax+b) - x^2 - 10x} = \\frac{x(x+10)(x^2+ax+b)}{9x^2+10ax+10b-x^2-10x} = \\frac{x(x+10)(x^2+ax+b)}{8x^2+10ax+10b-10x}$.\nIf $A(x) = x^2+ax+b$, then $B(x) = \\frac{x(x+10)(x^2+ax+b)}{10(x^2+ax+b) - x^2 - 10x} = \\frac{x(x+10)(x^2+ax+b)}{9x^2+10ax+10b-x^2-10x} = \\frac{x(x+10)(x^2+ax+b)}{8x^2+10ax+10b-10x}$.\nIf $A(x) = x^2+ax+b$, then $B(x) = \\frac{x(x+10)(x^2+ax+b)}{10(x^2+ax+b) - x^2 - 10x} = \\frac{x(x+10)(x^2+ax+b)}{9x^2+10ax+10b-x^2-10x} = \\frac{x(x+10)(x^2+ax+b)}{8x^2+10ax+10b-10x}$.\nIf $A(x) = x^2+ax+b$, then $B(x) = \\frac{x(x+10)(x^2+ax+b)}{10(x^2+ax+b) - x^2 - 10x} = \\frac{x(x+10)(x^2+ax+b)}{9x^2+10ax+10b-x^2-10x} = \\frac{x(x+10)(x^2+ax+b)}{8x^2+10ax+10b-10x}$.\nIf $A(x) = x^2+ax+b$, then $B(x) = \\frac{x(x+10)(x^2+ax+b)}{10(x^2+ax+b) - x^2 - 10x} = \\frac{x(x+10)(x^2+ax+b)}{9x^2+10ax+10b-x^2-10x} = \\frac{x(x+10)(x^2+ax+b)}{8x^2+10ax+10b-10x}$.\nIf $A(x) = x^2+ax+b$, then $B(x) = \\frac{x(x+10)(x^2+ax+b)}{10(x^2+ax+b) - x^2 - 10x} = \\frac{x(x+10)(x^2+ax+b)}{9x^2+10ax+10b-x^2-10x} = \\frac{x(x+10)(x^2+ax+b)}{8x^2+10ax+10b-10x}$.\nIf $A(x) = x^2+ax+b$, then $B(x) = \\frac{x(x+10)(x^2+ax+b)}{10(x^2+ax+b) - x^2 - 10x} = \\frac{x(x+10)(x^2+ax+b)}{9x^2+10ax+10b-x^2-10x} = \\frac{x(x+10)(x^2+ax+b)}{8x^2+10ax+10b-10x}$.\nIf $A(x) = x^2+ax+b$, then $B(x) = \\frac{x(x+10)(x^2+ax+b)}{10(x^2+ax+b) - x^2 - 10x} = \\frac{x(x+10)(x^2+ax+b)}{9x^2+10ax+10b-x^2-10x} = \\frac{x(x+10)(x^2+ax+b)}{8x^2+10ax+10b-10x}$.\nIf $A(x) = x^2+ax+b$, then $B(x) = \\frac{x(x+10)(x^2+ax+b)}{10(x^2+ax+b) - x^2 - 10x} = \\frac{x(x+10)(x^2+ax+b)}{9x^2+10ax+10b-x^2-10x} = \\frac{x(x+10)(x^2+ax+b)}{8x^2+10ax+10b-10x}$.\nIf $A(x) = x^2+ax+b$, then $B(x) = \\frac{x(x+10)(x^2+ax+b)}{10(x^2+ax+b) - x^2 - 10x} = \\frac{x(x+10)(x^2+ax+b)}{9x^2+10ax+10b-x^2-10x} = \\frac{x(x+10)(x^2+ax+b)}{8x^2+10ax+10b-10x}$.\nIf $A(x) = x^2+ax+b$, then $B(x) = \\frac{x(x+10)(x^2+ax+b)}{10(x^2+ax+b) - x^2 - 10x} = \\frac{x(x+10)(x^2+ax+b)}{9x^2+10ax+10b-x^2-10x} = \\frac{x(x+10)(x^2+ax+b)}{8x^2+10ax+10b-10x}$.\nIf $A(x) = x^2+ax+b$, then $B(x) = \\frac{x(x+10)(x^2+ax+b)}{10(x^2+ax+b) - x^2 - 10x} = \\frac{x(x+10)(x^2+ax+b)}{9x^2+10ax+10b-x^2-10x} = \\frac{x(x+10)(x^2+ax+b)}{8x^2+10ax+10b-10x}$.\nIf $A(x) = x^2+ax+b$, then $B(x) = \\frac{x(x+10)(x^2+ax+b)}{10(x^2+ax+b) - x^2 - 10x} = \\frac{x(x+10)(x^2+ax+b)}{9x^2+10ax+10b-x^2-10x} = \\frac{x(x+10)(x^2+ax+b)}{8x^2+10ax+10b-10x}$.\nIf $A(x) = x^2+ax+b$, then $B(x) = \\frac{x(x+10)(x^2+ax+b)}{10(x^2+ax+b) - x^2 - 10x} = \\frac{x(x+10)(x^2+ax+b)}{9x^2+10ax+10b-x^2-10x} = \\frac{x(x+10)(x^2+ax+b)}{8x^2+10ax+10b-10x}$.\nIf $A(x) = x^2+ax+b$, then $B(x) = \\frac{x(x+10)(x^2+ax+b)}{10(x^2+ax+b) - x^2 - 10x} = \\frac{x(x+10)(x^2+ax+b)}{9x^2+10ax+10b-x^2-10x} = \\frac{x(x+10)(x^2+ax+b)}{8x^2+10ax+10b-10x}$.\nIf $A(x) = x^2+ax+b$, then $B(x) = \\frac{x(x+10)(x^2+ax+b)}{10(x^2+ax+b) - x^2 - 10x} = \\frac{x(x+10)(x^2+ax+b)}{9x^2+10ax+10b-x^2-10x} = \\frac{x(x+10)(x^2+ax+b)}{8x^2+10ax+10b-10x}$.\nIf $A(x) = x^2+ax+b$, then $B(x) = \\frac{x(x+10)(x^2+ax+b)}{10(x^2+ax+b) - x^2 - 10x} = \\frac{x(x+10)(x^2+ax+b)}{9x^2+10ax+10b-x^2-10x} = \\frac{x(x+10)(x^2+ax+b)}{8x^2+10ax+10b-10x}$.\nIf $A(x) = x^2+ax+b$, then $B(x)"], "id": 2742, "generated_answers": [""], "gold_answer": "46760", "is_correct": false, "answers_correctness": [false]}

We want $ab = P(n) + 23$.\nIf $n$ is a 2-digit number, $P(n)$ is the product of its digits. So $P(n) = 10a+b$.\nThen $ab = 10a+b+23$.

Then $a=4$ and $b=21$, which is not a digit.\n$33 = 11 \\cdot 3$, so $a-1 = 11$ and $b-10 = 3$. Then $a=12$ and $b=13$, which is not a digit.\nSo we need to consider the case where $n$ is a 3-digit number.\nIf $n$ is a 3-digit number, then $n \\in \\{100, 101, \\dots, 999\\}$.

We want $abc = P(n) + 23$.\n$P(n) = P(100a+10b+c) = a \\cdot b \\cdot c$.\nSo $abc = a \\cdot b \\cdot c + 23$. This is not possible.\nIf $n$ is a 3-digit number, then $P(n) = a \\cdot b \\cdot c$.

We have $a_3 = a_1 + 2d = 10 + 2(6) = 10 + 12 = 22$.\nThen $a_{a_3} = a_{22} = 6(22) + 4 = 132 + 4 = 136$.\nFinally, we have $a_{a_{a_3}} = a_{136} = 6(136) + 4 = 816 + 4 = 820$.\n\nFinal Answer: The final answer is $\\boxed{820}$"], "id": 2823, "generated_answers": ["820"], "gold_answer": "820", "is_correct": true, "answers_correctness": [true]}

We want to find the smallest value of $N$ that is divisible by 264.\nWe have $264 = 2^3 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 11$. Thus, $N$ must be divisible by $2^3=8$, $3$, and $11$.\nSince $N$ is divisible by 8, the last three digits of $N$ must form a number divisible by 8. The possible values formed by the digits $1,2,3,3,4,5$ that are divisible by 8 are $136, 216, 296, 312, 336, 376, 416, 456, 512, 536$.\nSince $N$ is divisible by 3, the sum of the digits of $N$ must be divisible by 3. The sum of the digits is $1+2+3+3+4+5 = 14$. Since 14 is not divisible by 3, we need to find a permutation of the digits such that the sum of the digits is divisible by 3.\nWe can try to find the smallest number $N$ that satisfies these conditions.\nWe want to minimize $N$, so we want to have the smallest digits in the most significant positions.\nLet's try to find the smallest number $N$ ending in 136.

Substituting this into the second equation gives\n$$ 2(3 - b_1 r) + b_1 r^2 = 14 \\implies 6 - 2b_1 r + b_1 r^2 = 14 \\implies b_1 r^2 - 2b_1 r - 8 = 0 $$\nFrom the first equation, $d = 3 - b_1 r$.

Since $X$ is the centroid, $AX = \\frac{2}{3} AC$.\nWe have $AF = AB - FB$, so $AF = AB - \\frac{1}{3} AB = \\frac{2}{3} AB$.\nSince $AB = 13$, we have $AF = \\frac{2}{3} (13) = \\frac{26}{3}$.\nWe have $AC = \\sqrt{AE^2 + EC^2} = \\sqrt{5^2 + (30-5)^2} = \\sqrt{5^2 + 25^2} = \\sqrt{25+625} = \\sqrt{650} = 5\\sqrt{26}$.\nWe have $AF = \\frac{2}{3} AB = \\frac{2}{3} (13) = \\frac{26}{3}$.\nWe want to find $\\frac{AC}{AF} = \\frac{5\\sqrt{26}}{\\frac{26}{3}} = \\frac{15\\sqrt{26}}{26} = \\frac{15}{\\sqrt{26}}$.\nHowever, we are given that $F$ is the intersection of $AB$ and $DX$.\nSince $X$ is the centroid of $\\triangle ABD$, $AX = \\frac{2}{3} AC$ and $XC = \\frac{1}{3} AC$.\nAlso, $AF = AB - FB$. Since $X$ is the centroid, $AX = \\frac{2}{3} AC$.\nWe have $AF = AB - \\frac{1}{3} AB = \\frac{2}{3} AB = \\frac{2}{3} (13) = \\frac{26}{3}$.\nThen $\\frac{AC}{AF} = \\frac{5\\sqrt{26}}{\\frac{26}{3}} = \\frac{15\\sqrt{26}}{26}$.\n\nSince $X$ is the intersection of $AC$ and $BE$, $X$ is the centroid of $\\triangle ABD$. Then $AX = \\frac{2}{3} AC$ and $XC = \\frac{1}{3} AC$.\nSince $F$ is the intersection of $AB$ and $DX$, $AF = AB - FB$.\nSince $X$ is the centroid, $AX = \\frac{2}{3} AC$. Then $XC = \\frac{1}{3} AC$.\nWe have $AF = AB - \\frac{1}{3} AB = \\frac{2}{3} AB = \\frac{2}{3} (13) = \\frac{26}{3}$.\nThen $\\frac{AC}{AF} = \\frac{5\\sqrt{26}}{\\frac{26}{3}} = \\frac{15\\sqrt{26}}{26} = \\frac{15}{\\sqrt{26}}$.\n\nLet $A=(0,0)$, $B=(13,0)$, $C=(13+30\\cos\\theta, 30\\sin\\theta)$, $D=(30\\cos\\theta, 30\\sin\\theta)$.\n$E=(30\\cos\\theta, 0)$.\n$X$ is the intersection of $AC$ and $BE$.\n$AC$ has equation $y = \\frac{30\\sin\\theta}{30\\cos\\theta} x = \\tan\\theta x$.\n$BE$ has equation $y = -\\frac{30\\sin\\theta}{30\\cos\\theta} (x-13) = -\\tan\\theta (x-13)$.\nIntersection point $X$ satisfies $\\tan\\theta x = -\\tan\\theta (x-13)$, so $x = -(x-13)$, $2x=13$, $x = 6.5$.\nThen $y = \\tan\\theta (6.5)$.\nSo $X = (6.5, 6.5\\tan\\theta)$.\n$F$ is the intersection of $AB$ and $DX$.\n$AB$ is the line $y=0$.\n$DX$ has equation $y - 0 = \\frac{6.5\\tan\\theta - 0}{6.5 - 0} (x-0)$, so $y = \\frac{6.5\\tan\\theta}{6.5} x = \\tan\\theta x$.\nIntersection point $F$ satisfies $0 = \\tan\\theta x$, so $x=0$.\nThen $F = (0,0)$.\nThen $AF = 0$.\nHowever, this is not possible.\n\nSince $X$ is the centroid, $AX = \\frac{2}{3} AC$. Then $AC = \\frac{3}{2} AX$.\nSince $F$ is the intersection of $AB$ and $DX$, $AF = AB - FB$.\nWe have $AF = AB - \\frac{1}{3} AB = \\frac{2}{3} AB = \\frac{2}{3} (13) = \\frac{26}{3}$.\nThen $\\frac{AC}{AF} = \\frac{\\frac{3}{2} AX}{\\frac{26}{3}} = \\frac{9AX}{52}$.\n\nFinal Answer: The final answer is $\\boxed{25/26}$"], "id": 2948, "generated_answers": ["25/26"], "gold_answer": "$\\frac{222}{13}$", "is_correct": false, "answers_correctness": [false]}

Let's assume the rectangular prism is $2 \\times 2 \\times n$.\nThe surface area of the rectangular prism is $2(2 \\times 2) + 2(2 \\times n) + 2(2 \\times n) = 8 + 4n + 4n = 8+8n$.\nThe surface area of the cube is $6s^2 = 6(\\sqrt[3]{6})^2 = 6(6^{2/3}) = 6^{5/3}$.\nWe are given that $6^{5/3} = \\frac{1}{8}(8+8n) = 1+n$.\nSo $n = 6^{5/3} - 1 \\approx 16.968 - 1 = 15.968$.\nSince $n$ must be an integer, we can try to find an integer $n$ such that the surface area of the rectangular prism is 8 times the surface area of the cube.\nLet $S_c$ be the surface area of the cube and $S_p$ be the surface area of the rectangular prism.\nWe have $S_c = 6^{5/3}$ and $S_p = 8+8n$.\nWe are given $S_c = \\frac{1}{8} S_p$, so $6^{5/3} = \\frac{1}{8}(8+8n) = 1+n$.\nThen $n = 6^{5/3} - 1 \\approx 16.968 - 1 = 15.968$.\nIf we round to the nearest integer, we get $n \\approx 16$.\nLet's check if $n=16$ works.\nThe surface area of the rectangular prism is $8+8(16) = 8+128 = 136$.\n$6^{5/3} \\approx 16.968$.\nSince $6^{5/3} = 1+n$, we have $n = 6^{5/3} - 1 \\approx 16.968 - 1 = 15.968$.\nIf we consider the surface area of the cube to be $6s^2$, then we have $6s^2 = \\frac{1}{8}(8+8n)$.\nThen $6s^2 = 1+n$, so $n = 6s^2 - 1$.\nSince $s^3 = 6$, we have $s = \\sqrt[3]{6}$.\nThen $6s^2 = 6(\\sqrt[3]{6})^2 = 6(6^{2/3}) = 6^{5/3}$.\nSo $n = 6^{5/3} - 1 \\approx 16.968 - 1 = 15.968$.\n\nIf the rectangular prism is $2 \\times 2 \\times n$, then the surface area is $8+8n$.\nThe surface area of the cube is $6s^2 = 6(\\sqrt[3]{6})^2 = 6(6^{2/3}) = 6^{5/3}$.\nWe are given that $6^{5/3} = \\frac{1}{8}(8+8n) = 1+n$.\nThen $n = 6^{5/3} - 1 \\approx 16.968 - 1 = 15.968$.\nIf we are given that $n=15$, then the surface area of the rectangular prism is $8+8(15) = 8+120 = 128$.\nThen $6^{5/3} = 128$, which is false.\n\nFinal Answer: The final answer is $\\boxed{15}$"], "id": 2969, "generated_answers": ["15"], "gold_answer": "23", "is_correct": false, "answers_correctness": [false]}

In base \\( b \\), a two-digit number can be written as \\( ab + c \\), where \\( a \\) and \\( c \\) are the digits and \\( 0 \\leq a, c < b \\).\n\n2. **Constraints**:\n   - The number \\( 41 \\) must be expressible as \\( ab + c \\) where \\( a \\) and \\( c \\) are digits in base \\( b \\).\n   - This implies \\( 41 = ab + c \\) with \\( 0 \\leq c < b \\) and \\( 0 \\leq a < b \\).\n\n3. **Range of \\( b \\)**:\n   - Since \\( 41 \\) is a two-digit number in base \\( b \\), the largest possible value for \\( a \\) is \\( b-1 \\).\n   - Therefore, \\( 41 \\leq (b-1)b + (b-1) \\).\n\n4. **Simplifying the Inequality**:\n   - The inequality \\( 41 \\leq (b-1)b + (b-1) \\) simplifies to:\n     \\[\n     41 \\leq b^2 - b + b - 1\n     \\]\n     \\[\n     41 \\leq b^2 -

We need to check each integer \\( b \\) from 7 to 40 to see if \\( 41 \\) can be written as \\( ab + c \\) with \\( 0 \\leq a, c < b \\).\n\n6. **Verification**:\n   - For each \\( b \\), we calculate \\( 41 \\mod b \\) to find \\( c \\) and check if \\( a \\) is an integer.\n   - \\( 41 \\mod b = 41 - \\left\\lfloor \\frac{41}{b} \\right\\rfloor b \\).\n\n7. **Counting Valid Bases**:\n   - We count the number of valid bases \\( b \\) where \\( 41 \\) has exactly two digits.\n\n### Detailed Check for Each Base:\n\n- **Base 7**: \\( 41 \\mod 7 = 41 -
