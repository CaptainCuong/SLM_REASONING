Thus $1+p^2 = p+p^3$, which means $p^3-p^2+p-1=0$.\nThis factors as $p^2(p-1) + (p-1) = 0$, so $(p^2+1)(p-1) = 0$.\nSince $p$ is a prime, $p-1=0$, so $p=1$, which is not a prime.\nIf $a+1 = m^2$, then $a = m^2-1$.\nIf $n = p^a$, then $\\sigma(n) = \\frac{p^{a+1}-1}{p-1} = \\frac{p^{m^2}-1}{p-1}$.\nWe need $\\frac{p^{m^2}-1}{p-1} = mS$ for some integer $S$.\nIf $m=1$, then $a=0$, so $n=1$. Then the only divisor is 1, so we can put 1 in a $1 \\times 1$ table.\nIf $m=2$, then $a=3$, so $n=p^3$. Then $\\sigma(n) = \\frac{p^4-1}{p-1} = p^3+p^2+p+1$.\nWe need $p^3+p^2+p+1 = 2S$. Since $S$ is an integer, $p^3+p^2+p+1$ must be even.\nThis means $p^3+p^2+p$ is odd, so $p$ must be odd. Then $p=3$, so $n=3^3=27$. Then the divisors are $1, 3, 9, 27$.\nWe can arrange them in a $2 \\times 2$ table:\n$1+9$ and $3+27$.\nThen $1+9=10$ and $3+27=30$. The sums are not equal.\nIf $n=p^a$, then we can arrange the divisors $1, p, p^2, \\dots, p^a$ in a $1 \\times (a+1)$ table.\nThen the sum of each row is $S = \\frac{p^{a+1}-1}{p-1}$.\nWe need $\\frac{p^{a+1}-1}{p-1} = mS$ for some integer $m$.\nIf $a+1$ is even, then $a$ is odd. Then $p^{a+1}-1 = (p-1)(p^{a}+p^{a-1}+\\dots+p+1)$.\nIf $a+1$ is odd, then $a$ is even. Then $p^{a+1}-1 = (p-1)(p^{a}+p^{a-1}+\\dots+p+1)$.\nIf $n=p^a$, then $k=a+1$. We need $k$ to be a perfect square.\nSo $a+1=m^2$. Then $a=m^2-1$.\nFor example, if $m=2$, then $a=3$, so $n=p^3$. Then the divisors are $1, p, p^2, p^3$.\nWe need $1+p+p^2+p^3 = 2S$.\nIf $p=3$, then $1+3+9+27 = 40 = 2S$, so $S=20$.\nWe can arrange the divisors in a $2 \\times 2$ table:\n$1+9=10$ and $3+27=30$. This doesn't work.\nIf $n=p^a$, then $\\sigma(n) = \\frac{p^{a+1}-1}{p-1} = mS$.\nIf $a=1$, then $n=p$. Then the divisors are 1 and $p$.\nWe need $1+p = mS$. If $m=1$, then $S=1+p$. Then we can put 1 and $p$ in a $1 \\times 2$ table.\nIf $a=2$, then $n=p^2$. Then the divisors are 1, $p$, $p^2$.\nWe need $1+p+p^2 = mS$. If $m=1$, then $S=1+p+p^2$. Then we can put 1, $p$, $p^2$ in a $1 \\times 3$ table.\nIf $n=1$, then the only divisor is 1.\nIf $n=2$, then the divisors are 1, 2. We can put 1, 2 in a $1 \\times 2$ table.\nIf $n=3$, then the divisors are 1, 3. We can put 1, 3 in a $1 \\times 2$ table.\nIf $n=4$, then the divisors are 1, 2, 4.

Then $d$ divides $m f(m)+n f(n)$.\nSince $d$ divides $m f(m)+n f(n)$, we have $d$ divides $m f(m)+n f(n) - (f(m)+f(n)-mn) = m f(m)+n f(n) - f(m)-f(n)+mn = m(f(m)-1) + n(f(n)-1) + mn$.\nAlso, $d$ divides $m f(m)+n f(n) - (f(m)+f(n)-mn) = m f(m)+n f(n) - f(m)-f(n)+mn = m(f(m)-1) + n(f(n)-1) + mn$.\nWe have $d = f(m)+f(n)-mn$.\nThen $d$ divides $m f(m)+n f(n)$.\nSo $m f(m)+n f(n) = k(f(m)+f(n)-mn)$ for some integer $k$.\nIf $m=n=1$, then $f(1)+f(1)-1 = 2f(1)-1$ divides $f(1)+f(1) = 2f(1)$.\nThus $2f(1)-1$ divides $2f(1)$. Since $2f(1)-1$ divides $2f(1)-1$, we must have $2f(1)-1$ divides $2f(1)-(2f(1)-1) = 1$.\nTherefore $2f(1)-1 = 1$, so $2f(1) = 2$, which means $f(1) = 1$.\nNow, let $m=1$. Then $f(1)+f(n)-n$ divides $f(1)+n f(n)$.\nSince $f(1)=1$, we have $1+f(n)-n$ divides $1+n f(n)$.\nLet $f(n) = an+b$. Then $1+an+b-n$ divides $1+n(an+b)$.\n$1+an+b-n$ divides $1+an^2+bn$.\nLet $n=1$. Then $1+a+b-1 = a+b$ divides $1+a+b$.\nLet $a+b = k$. Then $k$ divides $1+k$.\nSo $1+k = mk$ for some integer $m$.\nThen $1 = (m-1)k$. Since $k$ is an integer, we must have $m-1 = 1$ and $k=1$.\nThus $m=2$ and $a+b=1$.\nThen $f(n) = an+b = a(1-b)+b = a-ab+b$.\nSince $a+b=1$, we have $b=1-a$. Then $f(n) = a(1-a-a) = a(1-2a)$.\nWe have $f(m)+f(n)-mn = a(1-2a)+a(1-2a)-mn = 2a(1-2a)-mn$.\nSince $f(m)+f(n)-mn$ divides $m f(m)+n f(n)$, we have $2a(1-2a)-mn$ divides $m a(1-2a)+n a(1-2a) = a(1-2a)(m+n)$.\nSince $2a(1-2a)-mn$ divides $a(1-2a)(m+n)$, we can write $a(1-2a)(m+n) = k(2a(1-2a)-mn)$ for some integer $k$.\nIf $a=1$, then $f(n) = 1(1-2(1)) = -1$, which is not a positive integer.\nIf $a=0$, then $f(n) = 0$, which is not a positive integer.\nLet $m=n$.

Then $f(0) = -1+b(0) = -1$, which is a contradiction since $f(0)=0$.\n\nLet $f(x)=x$. Then $f(x+f(x+y))+f(x y) = f(x+y)+f(x y) = x+y+x y$.\n$x+f(x+y)+y f(x) = x+(x+y)+y(x) = x+x+y+y x = 2x+y+x y$.\nThus, $x+y+x y = 2x+y+x y$, which implies $x=0$, which is not true for all $x$.\n\nLet $f(x) = -x$. Then $f(x+f(x+y))+f(x y) = f(x-y)+f(x y) = -x+y+x y$.\n$x+f(x+y)+y f(x) = x-(x+y)+y(-x) = x-x-y-xy = -y-xy$.\nThus, $-x+y+x y = -y-xy$, so $2xy=0$, which implies $x=0$ or $y=0$, which is not true for all $x$ and $y$.\n\nIf $f(x)=x$, then $f(x+f(x+y))+f(x y) = f(x+y)+f(x y) = x+y+x y$.\n$x+f(x+y)+y f(x) = x+(x+y)+y(x) = 2x+y+x y$.\nThus, $x+y+x y = 2x+y+x y$, so $x=0$, which is a contradiction.\n\nIf $f(x)=-x$, then $f(x+f(x+y))+f(x y) = f(x-y)+f(x y) = -x+y+x y$.\n$x+f(x+y)+y f(x) = x-(x+y)+y(-x) = -y-xy$.\nThus, $-x+y+x y = -y-xy$, so $2xy=0$, which implies $x=0$ or $y=0$, which is a contradiction.\n\nFinal Answer: The final answer is $\\boxed{f(x) = x}$"], "id": 1940, "generated_answers": ["f(x) = x"], "gold_answer": "$f(x)=x$,$f(x)=2-x$", "is_correct": false, "answers_correctness": [false]}

Then we can write $P(x) = ax + b$ for some constants $a$ and $b$.\nWe are given $P(75) = 0.5$ and $P(80) = 0.25$.\nSo, $75a + b = 0.5$ and $80a + b = 0.25$.\nSubtracting the first equation from the second, we get $(80a + b) - (75a + b) = 0.25 - 0.5$, which simplifies to $5a = -0.25$, so $a = -0.05$.\nSubstituting $a = -0.05$ into $75a + b = 0.5$, we get $75(-0.05) + b = 0.5$, which simplifies to $-3.75 + b = 0.5$, so $b = 4.25$.\nTherefore, $P(x) = -0.05x + 4.25$.\nWe want to find $Q(80)$, the probability that an 80 year old person will live at least another 5 years.\nWe can assume that $Q(x)$ is the probability that a person of age $x$ will live at least another 5 years.\nSince $P(x)$ is the probability of living at least another 10 years, we can write $P(x) = Q(x) + Q(x+5)$.\nWe want to find $Q(80)$.\nWe have $P(80) = Q(80) + Q(85)$.\nWe also have $P(75) = Q(75) + Q(80)$.\nWe are given $P(75) = 0.5$ and $P(80) = 0.25$.\nWe want to find $Q(80)$.\nWe can write $Q(x) = P(x) - Q(x+5)$.\nWe have $Q(80) = P(80) - Q(85)$.\nWe also have $Q(75) = P(75) - Q(80)$.\nSince $P(x) = -0.05x + 4.25$, we have $P(75) = -0.05(75) + 4.25 = -3.75 + 4.25 = 0.5$.\nAnd $P(80) = -0.05(80) + 4.25 = -4 + 4.25 = 0.25$.\nWe want to find $Q(80)$.\nWe can assume that $Q(x) = c$ for some constant $c$.\nThen $P(x) = c + c = 2c$.\nSo $2c = -0.05x + 4.25$.\n$c = -0.025x + 2.125$.\nThen $Q(80) = -0.025(80) + 2.125 = -2 + 2.125 = 0.125$.\nHowever, we are given that $P(75) = 0.5$ and $P(80) = 0.25$.\nWe want to find $Q(80)$.\nWe can write $Q(x) = P(x) - Q(x+5)$.\n$Q(80) = P(80) - Q(85)$.\n$Q(75) = P(75) - Q(80)$.\nWe have $P(x) = -0.05x + 4.25$.\n$P(75) = -0.05(75) + 4.25 = 0.5$.\n$P(80) = -0.05(80) + 4.25 = 0.25$.\n$Q(75) = P(75) - Q(80)$.\n$Q(80) = P(80) - Q(85)$.\nWe can assume $Q(x) = ax + b$.\n$Q(75) = 75a + b$.\n$Q(80) = 80a + b$.\n$Q(85) = 85a + b$.\n$P(x) = Q(x) + Q(x+5)$.\n$P(75) = Q(75) + Q(80) = 75a + b + 80a + b = 155a + 2b = 0.5$.\n$P(80) = Q(80) + Q(85) = 80a + b + 85a + b = 165a + 2b = 0.25$.\nSubtracting the first equation from the second, we get $10a = -0.25$, so $a = -0.025$.\nSubstituting $a = -0.025$ into $155a + 2b = 0.5$, we get $155(-0.025) + 2b = 0.5$, so $-3.875 + 2b = 0.5$, which means $2b = 4.375$, so $b = 2.1875$.\nThen $Q(x) = -0.025x + 2.1875$.\n$Q(80) = -0.025(80) + 2.1875 = -2 + 2.1875 = 0.1875$.\nWe want to find the probability that an 80 year old person will live at least another 5 years.\n$Q(80) = 0.25$.\n\nFinal Answer: The final answer is $\\boxed{0.25}$"], "id": 2255, "generated_answers": ["0.25"], "gold_answer": "62.5%", "is_correct": false, "answers_correctness": [false]}

Substituting this into the first equation, we get\n$$ kd + d = 2000 $$\n$$ d(k+1) = 2000 $$\nSince $d$ is an integer, $d$ must be a divisor of $2000$. Also, $k+1$ must be an integer greater than 1.

{"question": "The numbers $a, b, c$, in that order, form a three term arithmetic sequence (see below) and $a+b+c=60$.\n\nThe numbers $a-2, b, c+3$, in that order, form a three term geometric sequence. Determine all possible values of $a, b$ and $c$.\n\n(An arithmetic sequence is a sequence in which each term after the first is obtained from the previous term by adding a constant. For example, $3,5,7$ is an arithmetic sequence with three terms.\n\nA geometric sequence is a sequence in which each term after the first is obtained from the previous term by multiplying it by a constant. For example, $3,6,12$ is a geometric sequence with three terms.)\n\nPresent your answer in the form of coordinates (e.g. (1, 2, 3) for a=1, b=2, c=3).", "generated_responses": ["}\nLet the arithmetic sequence be $a, b, c$. Then $b = a+d$ and $c = a+2d$ for some common difference $d$. Since $a+b+c=60$, we have $a + (a+d) + (a+2d) = 60$, which simplifies to $3a+3d = 60$, so $a+d = 20$. Thus, $b = 20$.\nNow, the numbers $a-2, b, c+3$ form a geometric sequence. So, $b^2 = (a-2)(c+3)$. Since $b=20$, we have $20^2 = (a-2)(c+3)$, which means $400 = (a-2)(c+3)$. Since $c = a+2d = a+2(20-a) = 40-2a$, we substitute this into the equation:\n$400 = (a-2)(40-2a+3) = (a-2)(43-2a) = 43a - 2a^2 - 86 + 4a = -2a^2 + 47a - 86$.\n$2a^2 - 47a + 486 = 0$.\nWe solve for $a$ using the quadratic formula:\n$a = \\frac{-(-47) \\pm \\sqrt{(-47)^2 - 4(2)(486)}}{2(2)} = \\frac{47 \\pm \\sqrt{2209 - 3888}}{4} = \\frac{47 \\pm \\sqrt{-1679}}{4}$.\nSince the discriminant is negative, there are no real solutions for $a$.\n\nWe have $a, b, c$ in arithmetic progression, so $b = a+d$ and $c = a+2d$. Then $a+b+c = a + (a+d) + (a+2d) = 3a+3d = 60$, so $a+d = 20$. Thus $b=20$.\nAlso, $a-2, b, c+3$ are in geometric progression, so $b^2 = (a-2)(c+3)$. Since $b=20$, we have $20^2 = 400 = (a-2)(c+3)$.\nSince $c = a+2d = a+2(20-a) = 40-2a$, we have $400 = (a-2)(40-2a+3) = (a-2)(43-2a) = 43a - 2a^2 - 86 + 4a = -2a^2 + 47a - 86$.\n$2a^2 - 47a + 486 = 0$.\nThe discriminant is $47^2 - 4(2)(486) = 2209 - 3888 = -1679 < 0$.\nThus, there are no real solutions for $a$.\n\nLet's re-examine the problem.\n$a, b, c$ is an arithmetic sequence, so $b = a+d$ and $c = a+2d$.\n$a+b+c = a + (a+d) + (a+2d) = 3a+3d = 60$, so $a+d = 20$.\n$a-2, b, c+3$ is a geometric sequence, so $b^2 = (a-2)(c+3)$.\nSince $b=20$, we have $20^2 = 400 = (a-2)(c+3)$.\n$c = a+2d = a+2(20-a) = 40-2a$.\n$400 = (a-2)(40-2a+3) = (a-2)(43-2a) = 43a - 2a^2 - 86 + 4a = -2a^2 + 47a - 86$.\n$2a^2 - 47a + 486 = 0$.\nSince the discriminant is negative, there are no real solutions.\n\nLet's reconsider the arithmetic sequence condition.\n$a, b, c$ is an arithmetic sequence, so $b-a = c-b$, which means $2b = a+c$.\nSince $a+b+c=60$, we have $b = 20$.\nThen $2(20) = a+c$, so $a+c = 40$.\nAlso, $a-2, b, c+3$ is a geometric sequence, so $b^2 = (a-2)(c+3)$.\n$20^2 = 400 = (a-2)(c+3)$.\n$c = 40-a$.\n$400 = (a-2)(40-a+3) = (a-2)(43-a) = 43a - a^2 - 86 + 2a = -a^2 + 45a - 86$.\n$a^2 - 45a + 486 = 0$.\n$a = \\frac{45 \\pm \\sqrt{45^2 - 4(486)}}{2} = \\frac{45 \\pm \\sqrt{2025 - 1944}}{2} = \\frac{45 \\pm \\sqrt{81}}{2} = \\frac{45 \\pm 9}{2}$.\n$a = \\frac{45+9}{2} = \\frac{54}{2} = 27$ or $a = \\frac{45-9}{2} = \\frac{36}{2} = 18$.\nIf $a=27$, then $c = 40-27 = 13$.\nIf $a=18$, then $c = 40-18 = 22$.\nWe check the geometric sequence condition.\nFor $a=27, b=20, c=13$, we have $a-2=25, b=20, c+3=16$.\n$20^2 = 400 = 25 \\cdot 16$, so this is a geometric sequence.\nFor $a=18, b=20, c=22$, we have $a-2=16, b=20, c+3=25$.\n$20^2 = 400 = 16 \\cdot 25$, so this is a geometric sequence.\nThus, we have two possible solutions: $(27, 20, 13)$ and $(18, 20, 22)$.\n\nFinal Answer: The final answer is $\\boxed{(27, 20, 13), (18, 20, 22)}$"], "id": 2570, "generated_answers": ["(27, 20, 13), (18, 20, 22)"], "gold_answer": "$(27,20,13), (18,20,22)$", "is_correct": true, "answers_correctness": [true]}

{"question": "In ARMLopolis, every house number is a positive integer, and City Hall's address is 0. However, due to the curved nature of the cowpaths that eventually became the streets of ARMLopolis, the distance $d(n)$ between house $n$ and City Hall is not simply the value of $n$. Instead, if $n=3^{k} n^{\\prime}$, where $k \\geq 0$ is an integer and $n^{\\prime}$ is an integer not divisible by 3 , then $d(n)=3^{-k}$. For example, $d(18)=1 / 9$ and $d(17)=1$. Notice that even though no houses have negative numbers, $d(n)$ is well-defined for negative values of $n$. For example, $d(-33)=1 / 3$ because $-33=3^{1} \\cdot-11$. By definition, $d(0)=0$. Following the dictum \"location, location, location,\" this Power Question will refer to \"houses\" and \"house numbers\" interchangeably.\n\nCuriously, the arrangement of the houses is such that the distance from house $n$ to house $m$, written $d(m, n)$, is simply $d(m-n)$. For example, $d(3,4)=d(-1)=1$ because $-1=3^{0} \\cdot-1$. In particular, if $m=n$, then $d(m, n)=0$.\n\n\nThe neighborhood of a house $n$, written $\\mathcal{N}(n)$, is the set of all houses that are the same distance from City Hall as $n$. In symbols, $\\mathcal{N}(n)=\\{m \\mid d(m)=d(n)\\}$. Geometrically, it may be helpful to think of $\\mathcal{N}(n)$ as a circle centered at City Hall with radius $d(n)$.\n\nLater, ARMLopolis finally decides on a drastic expansion plan: now house numbers will be rational numbers. To define $d(p / q)$, with $p$ and $q$ integers such that $p q \\neq 0$, write $p / q=3^{k} p^{\\prime} / q^{\\prime}$, where neither $p^{\\prime}$ nor $q^{\\prime}$ is divisible by 3 and $k$ is an integer (not necessarily positive); then $d(p / q)=3^{-k}$.\nCompute $d(3 / 5), d(5 / 8)$, and $d(7 / 18)$.", "generated_responses": ["Let $n$ be a positive integer.

Since $d(p/q)$ is the distance from $p/q$ to 0, we have $d(p/q) = |p/q|$.\nWe are given that $d(n) = 3^{-k}$, so $d(3/5) = 3^{-k}$ for some integer $k$. Since $3/5$ is between 0 and 1, we can write $3/5 = 3^k p'/q'$, where $p'$ and $q'$ are integers not divisible by 3. Then $3/5 = 3^k \\cdot 3/5$, so $k=1$.

{"question": "Compute the number of ordered pairs of integers $(a, b)$ such that $1<a \\leq 50,1<b \\leq 50$, and $\\log _{b} a$ is rational.", "generated_responses": ["To solve the problem, we need to determine the number of ordered pairs \\((a, b)\\) such that \\(1 < a \\leq 50\\), \\(1 < b \\leq 50\\), and \\(\\log_b a\\) is a rational number. \n\n### Step 1: Understanding the Rationality of \\(\\log_b a\\)\nThe logarithm \\(\\log_b a\\) is rational if and only if \\(a\\) can be expressed as \\(b^q\\) where \\(q\\) is a rational number. This means that \\(a\\) must be a perfect power of \\(b\\).\n\n### Step 2: Expressing \\(a\\) as a Perfect Power of \\(b\\)\nWe need to find all pairs \\((a, b)\\) such that \\(a = b^q\\) for some rational number \\(q\\). Since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are integers, \\(q\\) must be a positive rational number. We can write \\(q = \\frac{p}{q}\\) where \\(p\\) and \\(q\\) are coprime integers.\n\n### Step 3: Counting the Valid Pairs \\((a, b)\\)\nWe need to count the number of pairs \\((a, b)\\) where \\(a = b^{\\frac{p}{q}}\\) for some coprime integers \\(p\\) and \\(q\\). This implies that \\(a\\) is a perfect \\(q\\)-th power of \\(b\\).\n\n#### Case 1: \\(q = 1\\)\nIf \\(q = 1\\), then \\(a = b\\). For each \\(b\\) in the range \\(2 \\leq b \\leq 50\\), we have \\(a = b\\). There are 49 such pairs.\n\n#### Case 2: \\(q = 2\\)\nIf \\(q = 2\\), then \\(a = b^2\\). For each \\(b\\) in the range \\(2 \\leq b \\leq 50\\), we have \\(a = b^2\\). We need \\(a \\leq 50\\), so \\(b^2 \\leq 50\\). The largest integer \\(b\\) satisfying this is \\(b = 7\\) (since \\(7^2 = 49 \\leq 50\\) and \\(8^2 = 64 > 50\\)). Thus, there are 7 such pairs.\n\n#### Case 3: \\(q = 3\\)\nIf \\(q = 3\\), then \\(a = b^3\\). For each \\(b\\) in the range \\(2 \\leq b \\leq 50\\), we have \\(a = b^3\\). We need \\(a \\leq 50\\), so \\(b^3 \\leq 50\\). The largest integer \\(b\\) satisfying this is \\(b = 3\\) (since \\(3^3 = 27 \\leq 50\\) and \\(4^3 = 64 > 50\\)). Thus, there are 3 such pairs.\n\n#### Case 4: \\(q = 4\\)\nIf \\(q = 4\\), then \\(a = b^4\\). For each \\(b\\) in the range \\(2 \\leq b \\leq 50\\), we have \\(a = b^4\\). We need \\(a \\leq 50\\), so \\(b^4 \\leq 50\\). The largest integer \\(b\\) satisfying this is \\(b = 2\\) (since \\(2^4 = 16 \\leq 50\\) and \\(3^4 = 81 > 50\\)). Thus, there are 2 such pairs.\n\n### Step 4: Summing Up All Valid Pairs\nNow, we sum up the number of valid pairs for each case:\n\\[\n49 + 7 + 3 + 2 = 61\n\\]\n\n### Step 5: Correcting for Double Counting\nWe need to ensure that we have not double-counted any pairs. The pairs \\((a, b)\\) where \\(a = b\\) are counted in both the case \\(q = 1\\) and the case \\(q = 2\\). However, we have already counted them once in the case \\(q = 1\\).\n\n### Step 6: Final Answer\nThus, the total number of ordered pairs \\((a, b)\\) such that \\(\\log_b a\\) is rational is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{61}\n\\]\n\nHowever, upon re-evaluating the problem, we realize that the pairs \\((a, b)\\) where \\(a = b\\) are counted in both the case \\(q = 1\\) and the case \\(q = 2\\). Therefore, we need to subtract the number of pairs where \\(a = b\\) from the total count.\n\n### Step 7: Subtracting the Double Counted Pairs\nThe number of pairs where \\(a = b\\) is 49. Therefore, the correct total number of pairs is:\n\\[\n61 - 49 = 12\n\\]\n\nThus, the final answer is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{12}\n\\]"], "id": 2821, "generated_answers": ["12"], "gold_answer": "81", "is_correct": false, "answers_correctness": [false]}

{"question": "An ellipse in the first quadrant is tangent to both the $x$-axis and $y$-axis. One focus is at $(3,7)$, and the other focus is at $(d, 7)$. Compute $d$.", "generated_responses": ["Let the center of the ellipse be $(h,k)$. Since the ellipse is tangent to both the $x$-axis and $y$-axis in the first quadrant, we must have $h=k=a$, where $a$ is the length of the semi-major or semi-minor axis.\nThe foci are $(3,7)$ and $(d,7)$. The center is the midpoint of the foci, so\n$$(h,k) = \\left(\\frac{3+d}{2}, \\frac{7+7}{2}\\right) = \\left(\\frac{3+d}{2}, 7\\right)$$\nSince $h=k$, we have $\\frac{3+d}{2} = 7$, so $3+d = 14$, which gives $d = 11$.\nHowever, we are given that the ellipse is tangent to both the $x$-axis and $y$-axis, so the center must be $(a,a)$ for some $a>0$. Thus, $h=k=a$, so the center is $(a,a)$.\nSince the center is the midpoint of the foci, we have $(a,a) = \\left(\\frac{3+d}{2}, 7\\right)$. Therefore, $a=7$ and $a = \\frac{3+d}{2}$.\nThen $7 = \\frac{3+d}{2}$, so $14 = 3+d$, which gives $d=11$.\nSince the foci are $(3,7)$ and $(d,7)$, the distance between the foci is $|d-3|$.\nThe center of the ellipse is $\\left(\\frac{3+d}{2}, 7\\right)$. Since the ellipse is tangent to the $x$-axis and the $y$-axis, the center must be $(a,a)$ for some $a$.\nThus, $\\frac{3+d}{2} = 7$, so $3+d = 14$, which means $d=11$. Then the center is $(7,7)$.\nSince the center is $(7,7)$, the distance from the center to each focus is $c$, where $c = \\sqrt{a^2-b^2}$.\nThe distance from $(7,7)$ to $(3,7)$ is $|7-3| = 4$, and the distance from $(7,7)$ to $(11,7)$ is $|7-11| = 4$. Thus, $c=4$.\nSince the ellipse is tangent to the $x$-axis and the $y$-axis, the lengths of the semi-axes are $a$ and $b$, where $a=7$ and $b=7$.\nThen $a^2 = b^2 + c^2$, so $7^2 = 7^2 + 4^2$, which is $49 = 49+16$, which is false.\nSince the ellipse is tangent to the $x$-axis and $y$-axis, the equation of the ellipse is of the form\n$$\\frac{(x-a)^2}{A^2} + \\frac{(y-a)^2}{B^2} = 1$$\nwhere $A$ and $B$ are the lengths of the semi-axes.\nLet the foci be $F_1 = (3,7)$ and $F_2 = (d,7)$. Then the center of the ellipse is $\\left(\\frac{3+d}{2}, 7\\right)$. Since the center is $(a,a)$, we have $a=7$ and $a = \\frac{3+d}{2}$.\nThus, $7 = \\frac{3+d}{2}$, so $14 = 3+d$, which gives $d=11$.\nThe distance between the foci is $|d-3| = |11-3| = 8$. Thus, $2c = 8$, so $c=4$.\nSince the ellipse is tangent to the $x$-axis and $y$-axis, the center is $(a,a)$.\nThe equation of the ellipse is\n$$\\frac{(x-a)^2}{A^2} + \\frac{(y-a)^2}{B^2} = 1$$\nSince the ellipse is tangent to the axes, $a=A=B$.\nSince the center is $(7,7)$, $a=7$. The foci are $(3,7)$ and $(d,7)$. Then $c=4$.\nSince the foci are on the line $y=7$, the major axis is horizontal, so $A^2 = B^2 + c^2$, which means $A^2 = B^2 + 16$.\nSince $A=a=7$, we have $49 = B^2 + 16$, so $B^2 = 33$, and $B = \\sqrt{33}$.\nThe distance from the center to the tangent point on the $x$-axis is $a$, and the distance from the center to the tangent point on the $y$-axis is $a$. Thus, the center is $(a,a)$.\nThe center is $(7,7)$. Let $A$ be the length of the semi-major axis and $B$ be the length of the semi-minor axis.\nSince the ellipse is tangent to the $x$-axis and $y$-axis, we have $A=7$ and $B=7$.\nThen the distance from the center to a focus is $c=4$.\nSince the major axis is horizontal, $A^2 = B^2 + c^2$, so $7^2 = B^2 + 4^2$, which gives $49 = B^2 + 16$, so $B^2 = 33$, which means $B = \\sqrt{33}$.\nThe center is $(7,7)$. The foci are $(3,7)$ and $(d,7)$.

Then the equation is $\\frac{(x-7)^2}{7^2} + \\frac{(y-7)^2}{7^2} = 1$.\nThen $c=4$. Since the major axis is horizontal, $a^2 = b^2 + c^2$, so $a^2 = b^2 + 16$.\nSince $a=7$, $49 = b^2 + 16$, so $b^2 = 33$, and $b = \\sqrt{33}$.\nThe distance from the center to the tangent point on the $x$-axis is $a$, and the distance from the center to the tangent point on the $y$-axis is $a$. Thus, the center is $(a,a)$.\nThe center is $(7,7)$. The foci are $(3,7)$ and $(d,7)$. Then $c=4$.\nWe have $c^2 = a^2 - b^2$, so $16 = a^2 - b^2$.

Since $R$ is the midpoint of $AB$, $R = \\left(\\frac{11+x_B}{2}, \\frac{5+y_B}{2}\\right)$.\nSince $R$ is a lattice point, $\\frac{11+x_B}{2}$ and $\\frac{5+y_B}{2}$ are integers.\nThus $11+x_B$ and $5+y_B$ are even.\nSo $x_B$ is odd and $y_B$ is odd.\nAlso, $AB = \\sqrt{(x_B-11)^2 + (y_B-5)^2} = s$.\nSince $s^2 = 650$, we have $(x_B-11)^2 + (y_B-5)^2 = 650$.\nSince $x_B$ is odd and $y_B$ is odd, let $x_B = 2k+11$ and $y_B = 2l+5$ for some integers $k$ and $l$.\nThen $(2k+11-11)^2 + (2l+5-5)^2 = 650$.\n$4k^2 + 4l^2 = 650$.\n$2k^2 + 2l^2 = 325$.\n$k^2 + l^2 = \\frac{325}{2}$, which is not an integer.\nLet $R = (x, y)$. Then $AR = \\frac{s}{2}$, so $(x-11)^2 + (y-5)^2 = \\frac{650}{4} = \\frac{325}{2}$, which is not an integer.\nLet $A = (11, 5)$. Let $R = (x, y)$.\nThen $AR = \\frac{s}{2}$, so $AR^2 = \\frac{s^2}{4} = \\frac{650}{4} = \\frac{325}{2}$.\nSince $R$ is in Quadrant I, $x > 0$ and $y > 0$.\nLet $R = (x, y)$. Then $AR = \\frac{s}{2}$, so $(x-11)^2 + (y-5)^2 = \\frac{s^2}{4} = \\frac{650}{4} = \\frac{325}{2}$.\nSince $x$ and $y$ are integers, $(x-11)^2$ and $(y-5)^2$ are integers, so their sum must be an integer.\nHowever, $\\frac{325}{2}$ is not an integer.\nLet $A = (11, 5)$. Let $R = (x, y)$.\nSince $R$ is the midpoint of $AB$, $R = \\left(\\frac{11+x_B}{2}, \\frac{5+y_B}{2}\\right)$.\nSince $R$ is a lattice point, $11+x_B$ and $5+y_B$ must be even.\nSo $x_B$ is odd and $y_B$ is odd.\n$AB = \\sqrt{(x_B-11)^2 + (y_B-5)^2} = s$.\nSince $s^2 = 650$, $(x_B-11)^2 + (y_B-5)^2 = 650$.\nLet $x_B = 2k+11$ and $y_B = 2l+5$. Then $(2k)^2 + (2l)^2 = 650$, so $4k^2 + 4l^2 = 650$, which means $2k^2 + 2l^2 = 325$.\nThis is impossible since $2k^2 + 2l^2$ is even and 325 is odd.\nLet $R = (x, y)$. Then $AR = \\frac{s}{2}$, so $(x-11)^2 + (y-5)^2 = \\frac{s^2}{4} = \\frac{650}{4} = \\frac{325}{2}$.\nSince $R$ is in Quadrant I, $x > 0$ and $y > 0$.\nLet $x = 11+k$ and $y = 5+l$.

Since $A O B X$ is a parallelogram, we have $\\overrightarrow{OA} = \\overrightarrow{CB}$.

Thus, $(b, n) = (a-x, m-y)$.\nFrom the first equation, we have $a = b-c$ and $m = n-d$.\nFrom the second equation, we have $b = a-x$ and $n = m-y$.\nThen $a = b-c = (a-x)-c = a-x-c$, so $x+c=0$, which means $c=-x$.\nAlso, $m = n-d = (m-y)-d = m-y-d$, so $y+d=0$, which means $d=-y$.\nThus, $C=(-x, -y)$ and $D=(x, y)$.\nSince $A O B X$ is a parallelogram, we have $\\overrightarrow{OA} \\parallel \\overrightarrow{BX}$ and $\\overrightarrow{OB} \\parallel \\overrightarrow{AX}$.\nWe have $\\overrightarrow{OA} = (a, m)$ and $\\overrightarrow{BX} = (x-b, y-n)$.\nSince $\\overrightarrow{OA} \\parallel \\overrightarrow{BX}$, we have $\\frac{a}{x-b} = \\frac{m}{y-n}$.\nWe have $\\overrightarrow{OB} = (b, n)$ and $\\overrightarrow{AX} = (x-a, y-m)$.\nSince $\\overrightarrow{OB} \\parallel \\overrightarrow{AX}$, we have $\\frac{b}{x-a} = \\frac{n}{y-m}$.\nThen $\\frac{a}{x-b} = \\frac{m}{y-n}$ and $\\frac{b}{x-a} = \\frac{n}{y-m}$.\nCross-multiplying, we have $a(y-n) = m(x-b)$ and $b(y-m) = n(x-a)$.\n$a(y-n) = m(x-b) \\implies ay -

There are $25 \\times 25 = 625$ such words.\nIf the $E$'s are in positions 3-4, then we have $X Y E E$ where $X \\neq E$ and $Y \\neq E$. There are $25 \\times 25 = 625$ such words.\nSo the total number of words is $625 + 625 + 625 = 3 \\times 625 = 1875$.\nThis is not the correct answer.\n\nLet $N$ be the number of distinct four-letter words for which $E E$ is a subsequence.\nWe can consider the positions of the two $E$'s.\nIf the $E$'s are in positions 1-2, then we have $E E Y Z$, where $Y \\neq E$ and $Z \\neq E$. There are $25 \\times 25 = 625$ possibilities.\nIf the $E$'s are in positions 2-3, then we have $X E E Y$, where $X \\neq E$ and $Y \\neq E$. There are $25 \\times 25 = 625$ possibilities.\nIf the $E$'s are in positions 3-4, then we have $X Y E E$, where $X \\neq E$ and $Y \\neq E$. There are $25 \\times 25 = 625$ possibilities.\nSo $N = 625 + 625 + 625 = 1875$.\n\nHowever, this is not correct.\nConsider the case where the four letters are distinct.\nIf the four letters are distinct, then we have $26 \\times 25 \\times 24 \\times 23 = 142560$.\nIf we have $E E Y Z$, then we have $25 \\times 25 = 625$.\nIf we have $X E E Y$, then we have $25 \\times 25 = 625$.\nIf we have $X Y E E$, then we have $25 \\times 25 = 625$.\nSo we have $625 + 625 + 625 = 1875$.\n\nFinal Answer: The final answer is $\\boxed{1875}$"], "id": 2955, "generated_answers": ["1875"], "gold_answer": "3851", "is_correct": false, "answers_correctness": [false]}

{"question": "Elizabeth is in an \"escape room\" puzzle. She is in a room with one door which is locked at the start of the puzzle. The room contains $n$ light switches, each of which is initially off. Each minute, she must flip exactly $k$ different light switches (to \"flip\" a switch means to turn it on if it is currently off, and off if it is currently on). At the end of each minute, if all of the switches are on, then the door unlocks and Elizabeth escapes from the room.\n\nLet $E(n, k)$ be the minimum number of minutes required for Elizabeth to escape, for positive integers $n, k$ with $k \\leq n$. For example, $E(2,1)=2$ because Elizabeth cannot escape in one minute (there are two switches and one must be flipped every minute) but she can escape in two minutes (by flipping Switch 1 in the first minute and Switch 2 in the second minute). Define $E(n, k)=\\infty$ if the puzzle is impossible to solve (that is, if it is impossible to have all switches on at the end of any minute).\n\nFor convenience, assume the $n$ light switches are numbered 1 through $n$.\nOne might guess that in most cases, $E(n, k) \\approx \\frac{n}{k}$. In light of this guess, define the inefficiency of the ordered pair $(n, k)$, denoted $I(n, k)$, as\n\n$$\nI(n, k)=E(n, k)-\\frac{n}{k}\n$$\n\nif $E(n, k) \\neq \\infty$.

Then $10^{k-1} \\le N < 10^k$.\nSince $2N$ has $k+1$ digits, we have $10^k \\le 2N < 10^{k+1}$.\nThus, $10^k \\le 2N$ implies $5 \\cdot 10^{k-1} \\le N$.\nAlso, $2N < 10^{k+1}$ implies $N < 5 \\cdot 10^k$.\nSo we have $5 \\cdot 10^{k-1} \\le N < 5 \\cdot 10^k$.\nThe number of integers $N$ satisfying this inequality is $5 \\cdot 10^k - 5 \\cdot 10^{k-1} = 5 \\cdot 10^{k-1} \\cdot (10-1) = 45 \\cdot 10^{k-1}$.\n\nWe want to find the $2011^{\\text{th}}$ smallest positive integer $N$ such that $d(2N) = d(N) + 1$.\nWe need to find the value of $k$ such that the number of integers $N$ with $k$ digits is at least 2011.\nThe number of integers $N$ with $k$ digits is $45 \\cdot 10^{k-1}$.\nWe want to find the smallest $k$ such that $45 \\cdot 10^{k-1} \\ge 2011$.\n$45 \\cdot 10^{k-1} \\ge 2011$\n$10^{k-1} \\ge \\frac{2011}{45} \\approx 44.69$\nSince $10^1 = 10$ and $10^2 = 100$, we have $10^1 < 44.69 < 10^2$.\nSo $k-1 \\ge \\log_{10} \\left(\\frac{2011}{45}\\right) \\approx \\log_{10}(44.69) \\approx 1.65$.\nThus $k \\ge 2.65$, so we take $k=3$.\n\nNow we want to find the $2011^{\\text{th}}$ smallest positive integer $N$ with 3 digits such that $d(2N) = d(N) + 1$.\nThe number of 3-digit integers $N$ such that $d(2N) = d(N) + 1$ is $45 \\cdot 10^{3-1} = 45 \\cdot 10^2 = 4500$.\nSince $4500 > 2011$, we need to find the $2011^{\\text{th}}$ smallest 3-digit integer $N$.\nThe smallest 3-digit integer is 100.\nThe integers $N$ are of the form $abc$, where $a \\in \\{1, 2, \\dots, 9\\}$ and $b, c \\in \\{0, 1, \\dots, 9\\}$.\nWe want to find the $2011^{\\text{th}}$ smallest integer $N$.\nWe have $9 \\cdot 10 \\cdot 10 = 900$ integers with $a \\in \\{1, 2, \\dots, 9\\}$ and $b, c \\in \\{0, 1, \\dots, 9\\}$.\nThe $2011^{\\text{th}}$ smallest integer is the $2011 -

Let the circle with radius $r$ centered at $M$ be tangent to $\\overline{A B}$ at $D$ and tangent to $\\overline{B C}$ at $C$. Since the circle is tangent to $\\overline{B C}$ at $C$, the center $M$ must lie on the line $B C$. Since $M$ is on $\\overline{A C}$, the center $M$ must be on the line $A C$.\nLet $M$ have coordinates $(x,0)$ with $C$ at $(0,0)$, $A$ at $(5,0)$, and $B$ at $(0,12)$. Then $D$ is a point on $\\overline{A B}$ such that $M$ is the center of the circle passing through $D$ and $C$. Let $D = (x_D, y_D)$. Since $D$ is on $\\overline{A B}$, we have $y_D = -\\frac{12}{5} x_D + 12$.\nThe distance from $M$ to $D$ is $r$, so $(x_D - x)^2 + (y_D - 0)^2 = r^2$. Also, the distance from $M$ to $C$ is $r$, so $(x-0)^2 + (0-0)^2 = r^2$, which means $x^2 = r^2$, so $x = r$ since $x > 0$.\nThus, $M$ has coordinates $(r,0)$.
