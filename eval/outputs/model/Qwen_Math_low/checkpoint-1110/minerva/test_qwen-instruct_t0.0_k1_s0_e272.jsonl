We are given that the total energy is given by\n\\[\nE \\simeq -\\frac{G M^2}{R}\n\\]\nThe power radiated at the surface of the Sun is given by\n\\[\nP = \\frac{dE}{dt} = \\frac{d}{dt} \\left( -\\frac{G M^2}{R} \\right) = -G M^2 \\frac{d}{dt} \\left( \\frac{1}{R} \\right) = \\frac{G M^2}{R^2} \\frac{dR}{dt}\n\\]\nWe are given that the surface temperature of the Sun remains constant at $\\sim 5800 \\mathrm{~K}$. This means that the power radiated at the surface of the Sun is given by the Stefan-Boltzmann law:\n\\[\nP = \\sigma A T^4 = \\sigma (4 \\pi R^2) T^4\n\\]\nwhere $\\sigma$ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant, $A$ is the surface area of the Sun, and $T$ is the surface temperature. Since $T$ is constant, we have\n\\[\nP = \\sigma (4 \\pi R^2) T^4 = 4 \\pi \\sigma R^2 T^4\n\\]\nEquating the two expressions for $P$, we have\n\\[\n\\frac{G M^2}{R^2} \\frac{dR}{dt} = 4 \\pi \\sigma R^2 T^4\n\\]\nSince $M$ is constant, we can write\n\\[\n\\frac{dR}{dt} = \\frac{4 \\pi \\sigma R^4 T^4}{G M^2}\n\\]\nThis is a separable differential equation. We can rewrite it as\n\\[\n\\frac{dR}{R^4} = \\frac{4 \\pi \\sigma T^4}{G M^2} dt\n\\]\nIntegrating both sides, we get\n\\[\n\\int \\frac{dR}{R^4} = \\int \\frac{4 \\pi \\sigma T^4}{G M^2} dt\n\\]\n\\[\n-\\frac{1}{3R^3} = \\frac{4 \\pi \\sigma T^4}{G M^2} t + C\n\\]\nWe are given that the Sun is currently at radius $R_0$.

{"question": "A Boolean function $F(A, B)$ is said to be universal if any arbitrary boolean function can be constructed by using nested $F(A, B)$ functions. A universal function is useful, since using it we can build any function we wish out of a single part. For example, when implementing boolean logic on a computer chip a universal function (called a 'gate' in logic-speak) can simplify design enormously. We would like to find a universal boolean function. In this problem we will denote the two boolean inputs $A$ and $B$ and the one boolean output as $C$. \nFirst, to help us organize our thoughts, let's enumerate all of the functions we'd like to be able to construct. How many different possible one-output boolean functions of two variables are there? I.e., how many functions are there of the form $F(A, B)=C ?$", "generated_responses": ["Let $A$ and $B$ be two variables, each of which can be either 0 or 1. The output $C$ can be either 0 or 1. We want to find the number of possible functions $F(A, B) = C$.\nSince $A$ and $B$ can each be either 0 or 1, there are $2^2 = 4$ possible combinations of $A$ and $B$:\n\\begin{itemize}\n    \\item $A=0, B=0$\n    \\item $A=0, B=1$\n    \\item $A=1, B=0$\n    \\item $A=1, B=1$\n\\end{itemize}\nFor each of these combinations, the output $C$ can be either 0 or 1. Thus, there are $2^4 = 16$ possible functions $F(A, B) = C$.\nFor example, one possible function is $F(A, B) = A \\wedge B$, which is 1 only when $A=1$ and $B=1$.\nAnother possible function is $F(A, B) = A \\vee B$, which is 1 when $A=1$ or $B=1$.\nAnother possible function is $F(A, B) = A \\oplus B$, which is 1 when $A \\neq B$.\nAnother possible function is $F(A, B) = \\overline{A \\wedge B}$, which is 1 when $A=0$ or $B=0$.\nAnother possible function is $F(A, B) = \\overline{A \\vee B}$, which is 1 when $A=0$ and $B=0$.\nAnother possible function is $F(A, B) = A$, which is 1 when $A=1$.\nAnother possible function is $F(A, B) = B$, which is 1 when $B=1$.\nAnother possible function is $F(A, B) = \\overline{A}$, which is 1 when $A=0$.\nAnother possible function is $F(A, B) = \\overline{B}$, which is 1 when $B=0$.\nAnother possible function is $F(A, B) = 1$, which is 1 for all values of $A$ and $B$.\nAnother possible function is $F(A, B) = 0$, which is 0 for all values of $A$ and $B$.\n\nThe number of possible functions $F(A, B) = C$ is $2^{2^2} = 2^4 = 16$.\n\nFinal Answer: The final answer is $\\boxed{16}$"], "generated_answers": ["16"], "gold_answer": "16", "is_correct": true, "answers_correctness": [true]}

{"question": "Subproblem 0: For $\\omega \\geq 0$, find $A$ such that $A \\cos (\\omega t)$ is a solution of $\\ddot{x}+4 x=\\cos (\\omega t)$.\n\n\nSolution: If $x=A \\cos (\\omega t)$, then taking derivatives gives us $\\ddot{x}=-\\omega^{2} A \\cos (\\omega t)$, and $\\ddot{x}+4 x=\\left(4-\\omega^{2}\\right) A \\cos (\\omega t)$. Then $A=\\boxed{\\frac{1}{4-\\omega^{2}}}$. \n\nFinal answer: The final answer is \\frac{1}{4-\\omega^{2}}. I hope it is correct.\n\nSubproblem 1: For what value of $\\omega$ does resonance occur?", "generated_responses": ["Let $x(t) = A \\cos(\\omega t)$ be a solution of the equation $\\ddot{x} + 4x = \\cos(\\omega t)$.\nWe have $\\ddot{x} = -\\omega^2 A \\cos(\\omega t)$.\nSubstituting this into the equation, we get $-\\omega^2 A \\cos(\\omega t) + 4A \\cos(\\omega t) = \\cos(\\omega t)$.\nThis simplifies to $A(4-\\omega^2) \\cos(\\omega t) = \\cos(\\omega t)$.\nSince $\\cos(\\omega t) \\neq 0$, we can divide by $\\cos(\\omega t)$ to get $A(4-\\omega^2) = 1$, so $A = \\frac{1}{4-\\omega^2}$.\nFor $A$ to be a real number, we must have $4-\\omega^2 \\neq 0$, which means $\\omega^2 \\neq 4$, or $\\omega \\neq 2$.\nIf $\\omega=2$, then $A(4-4) = 1$, which is $0=1$, a contradiction.\nTherefore, $\\omega \\neq 2$.\n\nFor resonance to occur, we need to have a non-zero value of $A$. This means $4-\\omega^2 \\neq 0$, so $\\omega^2 \\neq 4$, which means $\\omega \\neq 2$.\nIf $\\omega=2$, then the equation becomes $\\ddot{x}+4x=\\cos(2t)$.\nIf $x(t) = A \\cos(2t)$, then $\\ddot{x} = -4A \\cos(2t)$.\nSubstituting this into the equation, we get $-4A \\cos(2t) + 4A \\cos(2t) = \\cos(2t)$, which simplifies to $0 = \\cos(2t)$.\nThis is not true for all $t$, so $\\omega=2$ does not lead to a solution.\n\nFinal answer: The value of $\\omega$ for which resonance occurs is $\\omega \\neq 2$.\n\nSubproblem 2: Find the particular solution for $\\omega=1$.\nIf $\\omega=1$, then $A = \\frac{1}{4-1} = \\frac{1}{3}$.\nSo the particular solution is $x(t) = \\frac{1}{3} \\cos(t)$.\nWe check this: $\\ddot{x} = -\\frac{1}{3} \\cos(t)$, and $\\cos(t) = \\cos(t)$.\nThen $\\ddot{x}+4x = -\\frac{1}{3} \\cos(t) + 4 \\cdot \\frac{1}{3} \\cos(t) = \\frac{12}{3} \\cos(t) - \\frac{1}{3} \\cos(t) = \\frac{11}{3} \\cos(t)$.\nThis is not equal to $\\cos(t)$, so we made a mistake.\n\nLet $x(t) = A \\cos(t)$. Then $\\ddot{x} = -A \\cos(t)$.\nSubstituting this into the equation, we get $-A \\cos(t) + 4A \\cos(t) = \\cos(t)$, which simplifies to $3A \\cos(t) = \\cos(t)$.\nThis means $3A = 1$, so $A = \\frac{1}{3}$.\nThen the particular solution is $x(t) = \\frac{1}{3} \\cos(t)$.\n\nFinal answer: The particular solution for $\\omega=1$ is $x(t) = \\frac{1}{3} \\cos(t)$.\n\nSubproblem 3: Find the particular solution for $\\omega=3$.\nIf $\\omega=3$, then $A = \\frac{1}{4-9} = \\frac{1}{-5} = -\\frac{1}{5}$.\nSo the particular solution is $x(t) = -\\frac{1}{5} \\cos(3t)$.\nWe check this: $\\ddot{x} = -\\frac{1}{5} (-9 \\cos(3t)) = \\frac{9}{5} \\cos(3t)$, and $\\cos(3t) = \\cos(3t)$.\nThen $\\ddot{x}+4x = \\frac{9}{5} \\cos(3t) + 4 \\left(-\\frac{1}{5} \\cos(3t)\\right) = \\frac{9}{5} \\cos(3t) - \\frac{4}{5} \\cos(3t) = \\frac{5}{5} \\cos(3t) = \\cos(3t)$.\nThis is equal to $\\cos(3t)$, so the particular solution is $x(t) = -\\frac{1}{5} \\cos(3t)$.\n\nFinal answer: The particular solution for $\\omega=3$ is $x(t) = -\\frac{1}{5} \\cos(3t)$.\n\nSubproblem 4: Find the particular solution for $\\omega=2$.\nIf $\\omega=2$, then $A = \\frac{1}{4-4}$, which is undefined.\nWe need to find a particular solution for $\\omega=2$.\nLet $x(t) = Bt \\cos(2t)$. Then $\\ddot{x} = B \\cos(2t) - 4Bt \\sin(2t)$.\nSubstituting this into the equation, we get $B \\cos(2t) - 4Bt \\sin(2t) + 4(Bt \\cos(2t)) = \\cos(2t)$.\nThis simplifies to $B \\cos(2t) - 4Bt \\sin(2t) + 4Bt \\cos(2t) = \\cos(2t)$, so $B \\cos(2t) + 4Bt \\cos(2t) - 4Bt \\sin(2t) = \\cos(2t)$.\nThis means $B(1+4t) \\cos(2t) - 4Bt \\sin(2t) = \\cos(2t)$.\nFor this to hold for all $t$, we must have $B(1+4t) = 1$ and $-4Bt = 0$.\nFrom $-4Bt = 0$, we have $B=0$, but then $B(1+4t) = 0$, which is not equal to 1.\nSo we need to find $B$ such that $B(1+4t) = 1$ for all $t$. This is impossible.\n\nLet $x(t) = Bt \\cos(2t) + C \\sin(2t)$.\nThen $\\ddot{x} = B \\cos(2t) - 4Bt \\sin(2t) - 4C \\cos(2t)$.\nSubstituting this into the equation, we get $B \\cos(2t) - 4Bt \\sin(2t) -

The general solution is\n\\[\ny(t) = y_h + y_p = A e^{-5t} + 20\n\\]\nAs \\(t \\to \\infty\\), the term \\(A e^{-5t} \\to 0\\). Therefore, the final or steady-state value for \\(y(t)\\) is\n\\[\n\\boxed{20}\n\\]\n\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 20. I hope it is correct.\n\nSubproblem 2: If \\(u=10\\) and \\(y(0)=0\\), what is the value of \\(y(t)\\) at \\(t=0.2\\)?\nLet the given equation be\n\\[\n\\dot{y}+5 y=10 u\n\\]\nWe are given that \\(u=10\\) and \\(y(0)=0\\). Substituting these into the equation, we get\n\\[\n\\dot{y}+5 y=10(10) = 100\n\\]\nThe homogenous solution is \\(y_h = A e^{-5t}\\). We are looking for a particular solution \\(y_p\\) such that\n\\[\n\\dot{y_p}+5 y_p=100\n\\]\nSince the right side is a constant, we try a constant solution, say \\(y_p = B\\). Then \\(\\dot{y_p}=0\\), so\n\\[\n0+5B=100 \\Rightarrow 5B=100 \\Rightarrow B=20\n\\]\nThus, the particular solution is \\(y_p = 20\\). The general solution is\n\\[\ny(t) = y_h + y_p = A e^{-5t} + 20\n\\]\nWe are given that \\(y(0)=0\\). Substituting \\(t=0\\) into the equation, we get\n\\[\n0 = A e^{-5(0)} + 20 = A(1) + 20 = A+20\n\\]\nThus, \\(A+20=0\\), so \\(A=-20\\). Therefore, the solution is\n\\[\ny(t) = -20 e^{-5t} + 20\n\\]\nWe want to find the value of \\(y(t)\\) at \\(t=0.2\\). Substituting \\(t=0.2\\) into the equation, we get\n\\[\ny(0.2) = -20 e^{-5(0.2)} + 20 = -20 e^{-1} + 20 = -20 \\cdot \\frac{1}{e} + 20 = -\\frac{20}{e} + 20 = 20 \\left(1 - \\frac{1}{e}\\right)\n\\]\nSince \\(e \\approx 2.718\\), we have\n\\[\ny(0.2) = 20 \\left(1 - \\frac{1}{2.718}\\right) = 20 \\left(1 - 0.3679\\right) = 20(0.6321) = 12.642\n\\]\nRounding to the nearest integer, we get 13.\n\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 13.

{"question": "Preamble: In the Sun, one of the processes in the He fusion chain is $p+p+e^{-} \\rightarrow d+\\nu$, where $d$ is a deuteron. Make the approximations that the deuteron rest mass is $2 m_{p}$, and that $m_{e} \\approx 0$ and $m_{\\nu} \\approx 0$, since both the electron and the neutrino have negligible rest mass compared with the proton rest mass $m_{p}$.\n\nIn the lab frame, the two protons have the same energy $\\gamma m_{p}$ and impact angle $\\theta$, and the electron is at rest. Calculate the energy $E_{\\nu}$ of the neutrino in the rest frame of the deuteron in terms of $\\theta, m_{p}$ and $\\gamma$.", "generated_responses": ["Let $E_1$ and $E_2$ be the energies of the two protons, and $E_3$ be the energy of the electron. Since the two protons have the same energy, $E_1 = E_2 = \\gamma m_p$. The electron is at rest, so $E_3 = m_e c^2 = 0$.\nThe total energy in the lab frame is $E_{\\text{lab}} = E_1 + E_2 + E_3 = 2\\gamma m_p + 0 = 2\\gamma m_p$.\nThe total momentum in the lab frame is $\\vec{P}_{\\text{lab}} = \\vec{p}_1 + \\vec{p}_2 + \\vec{p}_3 = 2\\gamma m_p \\vec{v}_1 + 0$, where $\\vec{v}_1$ is the velocity of the first proton.\nThe angle between the two protons is $\\theta$, so the momentum of the first proton is $\\vec{p}_1 = \\gamma m_p \\vec{v}_1 = \\gamma m_p (\\sin(\\theta/2), \\cos(\\theta/2), 0)$.\nThe momentum of the second proton is $\\vec{p}_2 = \\gamma m_p \\vec{v}_2 = \\gamma m_p (\\sin(\\theta/2), -\\cos(\\theta/2), 0)$.\nThe total momentum is $\\vec{P}_{\\text{lab}} = 2\\gamma m_p \\sin(\\theta/2) \\vec{i}$.\nThe magnitude of the momentum is $P_{\\text{lab}} = 2\\gamma m_p \\sin(\\theta/2)$.\nThe total energy in the rest frame of the deuteron is $E_{\\text{deut}} = E_{\\text{lab}} - \\vec{P}_{\\text{lab}} \\cdot \\vec{v}_{\\text{deut}}$, where $\\vec{v}_{\\text{deut}}$ is the velocity of the deuteron.\nSince the deuteron is at rest in the rest frame of the deuteron, $\\vec{v}_{\\text{deut}} = 0$, so $E_{\\text{deut}} = E_{\\text{lab}} = 2\\gamma m_p$.\nThe total momentum in the rest frame of the deuteron is $\\vec{P}_{\\text{deut}} = \\vec{P}_{\\text{lab}} -

E_{\\text{p}}$, where $E_{\\text{d}}$ is the energy of the deuteron and $E_{\\text{p}}$ is the energy of the proton.\nSince the deuteron is at rest in the rest frame of the deuteron, $E_{\\text{d}} = m_{\\text{d}} c^2 = 2m_p c^2$.\nThe energy of the proton in the rest frame of the deuteron is $E_{\\text{p}} = \\gamma m_p c^2$.\nThe energy of the neutrino is $E_{\\nu} = E_{\\text{deut}} -

I hope it is correct.\n\nSubproblem 1: Age of our universe when hydrogen atoms formed in years:", "generated_responses": ["The age of the universe when most He nuclei were formed is approximately 1 minute. This is equivalent to 60 seconds.\nTo convert this to years, we need to convert seconds to years.\nThere are 60 seconds in a minute, 60 minutes in an hour, 24 hours in a day, and 365 days in a year.\nSo, the number of seconds in a year is $60 \\times 60 \\times 24 \\times 365 = 31,536,000$ seconds.\nThe age of the universe when most He nuclei were formed is 1 minute, which is 60 seconds.\nTo convert this to years, we divide the number of seconds in a year by the number of seconds in a minute:\n$\\frac{31,536,000 \\text{ seconds}}{60 \\text{ seconds/minute}} = 525,600 \\text{

{"question": "What is the working temperature for silica glass in Celsius?", "generated_responses": ["The working temperature for silica glass is approximately 1000 degrees Celsius. This is because silica glass is a type of glass that is made from silicon dioxide (SiO2). The glass is formed by heating a mixture of sand and silicon to high temperatures, typically between 1000 and 1200 degrees Celsius. The glass is then allowed to cool and solidify. The working temperature for silica glass is the temperature at which the glass can be used for its intended purpose. For example, if the glass is used for window panes, the working temperature is the temperature at which the glass can be used without breaking. This is typically around 1000 degrees Celsius.\n\nFinal Answer: The final answer is $\\boxed{1000}$"], "generated_answers": ["1000"], "gold_answer": "1950", "is_correct": false, "answers_correctness": [false]}

The number of germanium atoms is $n_{Ge} = 13.78 \\times 6.022 \\times 10^{23} \\approx 8.30 \\times 10^{24}$ atoms.\n\nLet $n_B$ be the number of boron atoms. The number of charge carriers is the sum of the number of boron atoms and the number of germanium atoms. The charge carrier density is given by $\\frac{n_B + n_{Ge}}{V}$, where $V$ is the volume in $\\mathrm{cm}^3$. We are given that the charge carrier density is $3.091 \\times 10^{17} / \\mathrm{cm}^3$.\nThe volume of $1 \\mathrm{~kg}$ of germanium is $V = \\frac{1000 \\mathrm{g}}{72.64 \\mathrm{g/cm}^3} = \\frac{1000}{72.64} \\approx 13.78 \\mathrm{cm}^3$.\nThe number of charge carriers is $3.091 \\times 10^{17} / \\mathrm{cm}^3 \\times 13.78 \\mathrm{cm}^3 = 3.091 \\times 10^{17} \\times 13.78 \\approx 4.23 \\times 10^{18}$.\nSince the number of charge carriers is the sum of the number of boron atoms and the number of germanium atoms, we have $n_B + n_{Ge} = 4.23 \\times 10^{18}$.\nWe know $n_{Ge} = 8.30 \\times 10^{24}$, so $n_B + 8.30 \\times 10^{24} = 4.23 \\times 10^{18}$.\nThis is not possible, since $n_B$ must be a positive integer.\n\nThe number of charge carriers is the sum of the number of boron atoms and the number of germanium atoms. The number of charge carriers is $n_B + n_{Ge} = 4.23 \\times 10^{18}$.\nThe number of boron atoms is $n_B = 4.23 \\times 10^{18} - 8.30 \\times 10^{24} = 4.23 \\times 10^{18} - 8.30 \\times 10^{24} = 4.23 \\times 10^{18} -
