{"question": "A rare species appears on Earth. For each rare organism, the following events occur daily: there is a probability $p (0 \\leq p \\leq 1)$ that it disappears, a probability $\\frac{1-p}{3}$ that it remains unchanged, a probability $\\frac{1-p}{3}$ that it splits into two, and a probability $\\frac{1-p}{3}$ that it splits into three.

Then \\( y^2 = b^2 \\left( 1 - \\frac{x^2}{a^2} \\right) = b^2 \\left( \\frac{a^2 - x^2}{a^2} \\right) = \\frac{b^2 (a^2 - x^2)}{a^2} \\).
