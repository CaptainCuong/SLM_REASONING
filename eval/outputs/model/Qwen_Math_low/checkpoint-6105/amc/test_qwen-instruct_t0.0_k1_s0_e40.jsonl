Then $N = 2^{10} = 1024$.\nWe are looking for the number of sequences $A_1, A_2, \\dots, A_n$ such that $n \\le 10$, $A_i \\subseteq \\{1, 2, \\dots, 10\\}$ for all $i$, and $A_{i-1} \\subseteq A_i$ for $2 \\le i \\le n$.\nLet $A_1 = S_1$, $A_2 = S_2$, $\\dots$, $A_n = S_n$. Then we have $S_1 \\subseteq S_2 \\subseteq \\dots \\subseteq S_n$.\nWe can represent each subset $S_i$ as a binary vector of length 10, where the $j$-th element is 1 if $j \\in S_i$ and 0 otherwise.\nSince $A_{i-1} \\subseteq A_i$, we have that the binary vector representing $A_{i-1}$ is less than or equal to the binary vector representing $A_i$ in each position.\nLet $A_i = \\{a_{i1}, a_{i2}, \\dots, a_{ik_i}\\}$ where $1 \\le a_{i1} < a_{i2} < \\dots < a_{ik_i} \\le 10$. Then we can represent $A_i$ as a binary vector $v_i$ of length 10, where $v_i(a_{ij}) = 1$ for $1 \\le j \\le k_i$ and $v_i(j) = 0$ for $j \\notin A_i$.\nSince $A_{i-1} \\subseteq A_i$, we have $v_{i-1} \\le v_i$ componentwise.\nWe want to find the number of sequences $A_1, A_2, \\dots, A_n$ such that $n \\le 10$ and $A_{i-1} \\subseteq A_i$ for $2 \\le i \\le n$.\nLet $A_1 = \\emptyset$. Then $A_2$ can be any subset of $\\{1, 2, \\dots, 10\\}$. There are $2^{10} = 1024$ choices for $A_2$.\nSince $A_1 = \\emptyset$, we have $A_1 \\subseteq A_2$.\nNow, suppose we have $A_1, A_2, \\dots, A_i$ such that $A_{j-1} \\subseteq A_j$ for $2 \\le j \\le i$. We want to find the number of choices for $A_{i+1}$ such that $A_i \\subseteq A_{i+1}$.\nLet $A_i = \\{a_1, a_2, \\dots, a_k\\}$. Then $A_{i+1}$ must contain all elements of $A_i$.\nWe can think of this as choosing a subset of $\\{1, 2, \\dots, 10\\}$ that contains $A_i$.\nLet $B = \\{1, 2, \\dots, 10\\} \\setminus A_i$. Then we can choose any subset of $B$ to add to $A_i$ to form $A_{i+1}$.\nThe number of subsets of $B$ is $2^{|B|} = 2^{10 - |A_i|}$.\nWe want to find the number of sequences $A_1, A_2, \\dots, A_n$ such that $n \\le 10$ and $A_{i-1} \\subseteq A_i$ for $2 \\le i \\le n$.\nWe can think of this as choosing subsets $A_i$ such that $A_1 \\subseteq A_2 \\subseteq \\dots \\subseteq A_n$.\nWe can represent this as a sequence of binary vectors $v_1, v_2, \\dots, v_n$, where $v_i$ is the binary vector representing $A_i$.\nSince $A_{i-1} \\subseteq A_i$, we have $v_{i-1} \\le v_i$ componentwise.\nWe can think of this as a path from $v_1$ to $v_n$ in the 10-dimensional binary vector space.\nWe can choose any binary vector $v_1$ for $A_1$. Then we can choose any binary vector $v_2$ such that $v_1 \\le v_2$. We can continue this until we reach $v_n$.\nThe number of possible sequences is the number of paths from $v_1$ to $v_n$.\nWe can think of this as a sequence of subsets $A_1, A_2, \\dots, A_n$ such that $A_1 \\subseteq A_2 \\subseteq \\dots \\subseteq A_n$.\nWe can represent each subset as a binary vector of length 10.\nThe number of possible sequences is the number of paths from the origin to the point $(1, 1, \\dots, 1)$ in 10 dimensions.\nWe can think of this as a sequence of subsets $A_1, A_2, \\dots, A_n$ such that $A_1 \\subseteq A_2 \\subseteq \\dots \\subseteq A_n$.\nThe number of possible sequences is the number of paths from the origin to the point $(1, 1, \\dots, 1)$ in 10 dimensions.\nWe can think of this as a sequence of subsets $A_1, A_2, \\dots, A_n$ such that $A_1 \\subseteq A_2 \\subseteq \\dots \\subseteq A_n$.\nThe number of possible sequences is the number of paths from the origin to the point $(1, 1, \\dots, 1)$ in 10 dimensions.\nThe number of paths is $\\binom{10+n-1}{n-1} = \\binom{9+n}{n-1}$.\nWe want to find the number of sequences $A_1, A_2, \\dots, A_n$ such that $n \\le 10$ and $A_{i-1} \\subseteq A_i$ for $2 \\le i \\le n$.\nWe can think of this as choosing subsets $A_i$ such that $A_1 \\subseteq A_2 \\subseteq \\dots \\subseteq A_n$.\nThe number of possible sequences is the number of paths from the origin to the point $(1, 1, \\dots, 1)$ in 10 dimensions.\nThe number of paths is $\\sum_{n=1}^{10} \\binom{9+n}{n-1} = \\sum_{n=1}^{10} \\binom{9+n}{9}$.\nWe can use Vandermonde's identity to evaluate this sum.\n$\\sum_{n=1}^{10}

The equation of $C_2$ is $x^2 + (y-r_2)^2 = r_2^2$, so $x^2 + (y-10)^2 = 10^2 = 100$.\nWe want to find the intersection points of $C_1$ and $C_2$. We have the system of equations\n\\begin{align*} \\label{eq:1} (x-4)^2 + y^2 &= 16 \\\\ x^2 + (y-10)^2 &= 100 \\end{align*}\nExpanding the equations, we get\n\\begin{align*} x^2 - 8x + 16 + y^2 &= 16 \\\\ x^2 + y^2 - 20y + 100 &= 100 \\end{align*}\nSimplifying, we have\n\\begin{align*} x^2 - 8x + y^2 &= 0 \\\\ x^2 + y^2 - 20y &= 0 \\end{align*}\nSubtracting the two equations, we get\n\\[ (x^2 - 8x + y^2) - (x^2 + y^2 - 20y) = 0 - 0 \\]\n\\[ -8x + 20y = 0 \\]\n\\[ -8x = -20y \\]\n\\[ x = \\frac{20}{8} y = \\frac{5}{2} y \\]\nSubstituting $x = \\frac{5}{2} y$ into $x^2 + y^2 - 20y = 0$, we have\n\\[ \\left(\\frac{5}{2} y\\right)^2 + y^2 - 20y = 0 \\]\n\\[ \\frac{25}{4} y^2 + y^2 - 20y = 0 \\]\n\\[ \\frac{29}{4} y^2 - 20y = 0 \\]\n\\[ y \\left( \\frac{29}{4} y - 20 \\right) = 0 \\]\nSo $y = 0$ or $\\frac{29}{4} y = 20$, which means $y = \\frac{80}{29}$.\nIf $y = 0$, then $x = \\frac{5}{2} (0) = 0$. So $(0, 0)$ is one intersection point.\nIf $y = \\frac{80}{29}$, then $x = \\frac{5}{2} \\cdot \\frac{80}{29} = \\frac{200}{29}$.\nThe two intersection points are $(0, 0)$ and $\\left( \\frac{200}{29}, \\frac{80}{29} \\right)$.\nThe slope of the line passing through these two points is\n\\[ \\frac{\\frac{80}{29} - 0}{\\frac{200}{29} - 0} = \\frac{\\frac{80}{29}}{\\frac{200}{29}} = \\frac{80}{200} = \\frac{8}{20} = \\frac{2}{5} \\]\nThus, the slope is $\\frac{2}{5}$.

Thus the side lengths are $6, 6+d, 6+2d$.\nLet the angle between the sides of length 6 and $6+d$ be $\\theta$. Then the area of the triangle is\n$$ \\text{Area} = \\frac{1}{2} (6)(6+d) \\sin \\theta = \\frac{1}{2} (36+6d) \\sin \\theta $$\nSince the triangle has an angle of $120^\\circ$, we have $\\theta = 120^\\circ$.\nThen $\\sin \\theta = \\sin 120^\\circ = \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}$.\nThe area of the triangle is\n$$ \\text{Area} = \\frac{1}{2} (36+6d) \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2} = \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{4} (36+6d) = \\frac{3\\sqrt{3}}{2} (6+d) $$\nWe must have $6 > 0$, $6+d > 0$, and $6+2d > 0$. Thus $d > -6$.\nAlso, the triangle inequality must hold:\n\\begin{itemize}\n    \\item $6 + (6+d) > 6+2d \\implies 12+d > 6+2d \\implies 6 > d$\n    \\item $6 + (6+2d) > 6+d \\implies 12+2d > 6+d \\implies 6 > -d \\implies d > -6$\n    \\item $(6+d) + (6+2d) > 6 \\implies 12+3d > 6 \\implies 6 > -3d \\implies d > -2$\n\\end{itemize}\nThus we must have $d > -2$.\nWe also have $d < 6$.\nSince the area must be positive, we must have $d > -6$.\nSince the triangle has an angle of $120^\\circ$, we have\n$$ \\cos 120^\\circ = \\frac{6^2 + (6+d)^2 - (6+2d)^2}{2 \\cdot 6 \\cdot (6+d)} = \\frac{36 + 36 + 12d + d^2 - (36 + 24d + 4d^2)}{12(6+d)} = \\frac{36 - 12d - 3d^2}{12(6+d)} = \\frac{3 - d - 3d^2}{12(6+d)} = -\\frac{1}{2} $$\nThen $3-d-3d^2 = -6(6+d) = -36-6d$.\n$3-d-3d^2 = -36-6d$\n$3d^2 - 5d - 39 = 0$\n$d = \\frac{5 \\pm \\sqrt{25 - 4(3)(-39)}}{6} = \\frac{5 \\pm \\sqrt{25+472}}{6} = \\frac{5 \\pm \\sqrt{497}}{6}$\nSince $d > -2$, we must have $d = \\frac{5+\\sqrt{497}}{6}$.\nHowever, we are given that the answer is in the form $m \\sqrt{n}$, so we must have made a mistake.\n\nLet the sides be $a, a+d, a+2d$.
