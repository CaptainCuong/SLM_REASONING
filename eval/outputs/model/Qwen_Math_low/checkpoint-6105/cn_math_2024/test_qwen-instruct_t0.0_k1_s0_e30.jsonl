This implies that the elements of \\( A \\) must be chosen such that their differences are not in \\( I \\).\n\n### Step 2: Possible Differences\nThe possible differences between any two elements in \\( A \\) are:\n- \\( a_2 - a_1, a_3 - a_2, a_4 - a_3, a_5 - a_4 \\) (positive differences)\n- \\( a_1 - a_2, a_2 - a_3, a_3 - a_4, a_4 - a_5 \\) (negative differences)\n\nSince \\( |a_i - a_j| \\notin I \\), the differences must be outside the set \\( \\{1, 4, 5, 6\\} \\).\n\n### Step 3: Counting Valid Subsets\nTo count the number of valid subsets, we need to consider the constraints on the differences. We will use the principle of inclusion-exclusion to count the number of subsets that do not satisfy the condition, and then subtract this from the total number of subsets.\n\n#### Total Number of Subsets\nThe total number of subsets of \\( U \\) of size 5 is given by:\n\\[\n\\binom{25}{5} = \\frac{25 \\times 24 \\times 23 \\times 22 \\times 21}{5 \\times 4 \\times 3 \\times 2 \\times 1} = 53130\n\\]\n\n#### Subsets with at Least One Difference in \\( I \\)\nWe need to count the number of subsets where at least one of the differences \\( a_2 - a_1, a_3 - a_2, a_4 - a_3, a_5 - a_4 \\) (or their negatives) is in \\( I \\).\n\n### Step 4: Using Inclusion-Exclusion Principle\nLet \\( A_1, A_2, A_3, A_4 \\) be the events that \\( a_2 - a_1 = 1, 4, 5, 6 \\) respectively.

The number of ways to choose \\( a_1 \\) is \\( 25 - i - j \\). Thus, \\( |A_i \\cap A_j| = 25 - i - j \\).\n\n- \\( |A_i \\cap A_j \\cap A_k| \\): For each triple \\( (i, j, k) \\), we need \\( a_2 - a_1 = i \\), \\( a_3 - a_2 = j \\), and \\( a_4 - a_3 = k \\). This means \\( a_4 = a_3 + k = a_1 + i + j + k \\). The number of ways to choose \\( a_1 \\) is \\( 25 - i - j - k \\).

Here is the step-by-step solution:\n\n1. **Identical Sides and Ptolemy's Theorem:**\n   Ptolemy's theorem states that for a cyclic quadrilateral \\(ABCD\\), the sum of the products of the lengths of opposite sides is equal to the product of the lengths of the diagonals.

From Ptolemy's theorem, we have:\n   \\[\n   xy = 60\n   \\]\n\n3. **Using the Law of Cosines:**\n   In a cyclic quadrilateral, the diagonals can be found using the law of cosines in the triangles formed by the sides and the diagonals. However, a simpler approach is to use the fact that the product of the diagonals is known, and we can find the length of the diagonal \\(AC\\) (which is the diameter of the circle) by considering the properties of the cyclic quadrilateral.\n\n4. **Finding the Diameter:**\n   The diameter of the circle is the length of the diagonal \\(AC\\) or \\(BD\\). Since \\(AC \\cdot BD = 60\\), we need to find the individual lengths of \\(AC\\) and \\(BD\\).
