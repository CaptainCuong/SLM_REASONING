Let's denote the perfect squares by \\( m_1^2, m_2^2, \\ldots, m_k^2 \\) where \\( m_i \\) are integers. Thus:\n\\[ S_i = m_i^2 \\]\n\n### Step 3: Expressing \\( n \\) in Terms of its Divisors\nSince \\( d_1, d_2, \\ldots, d_k \\) are the divisors of \\( n \\), we can write:\n\\[ n = d_1 \\times d_2 \\times \\cdots \\times d_k \\]\n\n### Step 4: Using the Sum of Divisors\nThe sum of the divisors of \\( n \\) is given by:\n\\[ \\sigma(n) = d_1 + d_2 + \\cdots + d_k \\]\nSince \\( S_k = m_k^2 \\), we have:\n\\[ \\sigma(n) = m_k^2 \\]\n\n### Step 5: Finding \\( n \\) for Small \\( k \\)\n#### Case \\( k = 1 \\)\nIf \\( k = 1 \\), then \\( n = d_1 \\) and \\( S_1 = d_1 \\).

Let's denote these numbers as \\( x_1, x_2, \\ldots, x_{10} \\).\n\n### Step 2: Understanding the Second Line\nThe second line consists of numbers of the form \\( qab \\), where \\( a \\) and \\( b \\) are distinct numbers from the first line. Therefore, the second line contains numbers of the form \\( q(x_i - x_j) \\) for all distinct \\( i \\) and \\( j \\).\n\n### Step 3: Understanding the Third Line\nThe third line consists of numbers of the form \\( a^2 + b^2 - c^2 - d^2 \\), where \\( a, b, c, d \\) are distinct numbers from the first line. Therefore, the third line contains numbers of the form \\( (x_i - x_j)^2 + (x_k - x_l)^2 - (x_m - x_n)^2 - (x_p - x_q)^2 \\) for all distinct \\( i, j, k, l, m, n, p, q \\).\n\n### Step 4: Relating the Second and Third Lines\nWe need to ensure that every number in the second line is also a number in the third line.

Let's test \\( q = 1 \\) and \\( q = -1 \\).\n\n#### \\( q = 1 \\)\nFor \\( q = 1 \\), the second line contains numbers of the form \\( x_i - x_j \\). We need to check if:\n\\[ x_i - x_j = (x_a - x_b)^2 + (x_c - x_d)^2 - (x_e - x_f)^2 - (x_g - x_h)^2 \\]\n\nThis equation must hold for all \\( i \\) and \\( j \\).

This implies that the sets of colors in the horizontal slices must be the same as the sets of colors in the vertical slices and the diagonal slices.\n\n### Step 3: Analyzing the Slices\n- **Horizontal slices** (top and bottom): Each horizontal slice contains \\( n^2 \\) unit cubes, and there are \\( n \\) such slices.\n- **Vertical slices** (left and right): Each vertical slice contains \\( n^2 \\) unit cubes, and there are \\( n \\) such slices.\n- **Diagonal slices** (front and back): Each diagonal slice contains \\( n^2 \\) unit cubes, and there are \\( n \\) such slices.\n\n### Step 4: Counting the Colors\nSince each set of colors in the horizontal slices must be the same as the sets of colors in the vertical slices and the diagonal slices, we need to determine the maximum number of distinct colors that can appear in these slices.\n\n### Step 5: Using the Condition\nThe condition that every set in any group must appear in both of the other groups implies that the sets of colors in the horizontal slices must be the same as the sets of colors in the vertical slices and the diagonal slices. This implies that the maximum number of distinct colors in any slice must be the same for all slices.\n\n### Step 6: Determining the Maximum Number of Colors\nTo maximize the number of colors, we need to consider the constraints:\n- Each slice must have \\( n^2 \\) unit cubes.\n- The sets of colors in the horizontal slices must be the same as the sets of colors in the vertical slices and the diagonal slices.\n\n### Step 7: Using the Pigeonhole Principle\nBy the pigeonhole principle, if we have \\( n \\) slices and each slice must have \\( n^2 \\) unit cubes, the maximum number of distinct colors that can appear in these slices is \\( n \\).\n\n### Step 8: Conclusion\nThe maximum possible number of colors that can be present in the \\( n \\times n \\times n \\) cube, given the condition, is \\( n \\).\n\nThus, the final answer is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{n}\n\\]"], "id": 1818, "generated_answers": ["n"], "gold_answer": "$\\frac{n(n+1)(2 n+1)}{6}$", "is_correct": false, "answers_correctness": [false]}

However, we are asked to erase some linear factors from both sides so that each side still has at least one factor, and the resulting equation has no real roots.\n\n### Step 1: Simplify the Equation\nFirst, let's rewrite the equation in a more convenient form. We can express both sides of the equation as:\n\n\\[\n(x-1)(x-2) \\cdots(x-2016) = (x-1)(x-2) \\cdots(x-2016)\n\\]\n\n### Step 2: Identify the Roots\nThe roots of the polynomial on both sides are the integers from 1 to 2016. For the equation to hold, the product of the factors on both sides must be equal. This implies that the product of the factors that are not erased must be equal to 1.\n\n### Step 3: Determine the Factors to Erase\nTo achieve this, we need to find a way to cancel out the factors on both sides. We can do this by erasing the same factors from both sides. Let's denote the set of factors to be erased as \\( S \\).\n\n### Step 4: Calculate the Number of Factors to Erase\nThe total number of factors on both sides is 2016. To have no real roots, we need to erase all but one factor. This means we need to keep one factor on each side.\n\n### Step 5: Verify the Solution\nTo verify, let's consider the simplest case where we keep one factor on each side. For example, if we keep the factor \\( (x-1) \\) on both sides, the equation becomes:\n\n\\[\n(x-1) = (x-1)\n\\]\n\nThis equation is always true and has no real roots. Therefore, the least number of linear factors we need to erase to achieve this is:\n\n\\[\n2016 - 1 = 2015\n\\]\n\nThus, the least number of linear factors one needs to erase to achieve the desired result is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{2015}\n\\]"], "id": 1843, "generated_answers": ["2015"], "gold_answer": "2016", "is_correct": false, "answers_correctness": [false]}

One needs to draw $k$ lines not passing through the marked points and dividing the plane into several regions. The goal is to do it in such a way that no region contains points of both colors.\n\nFind the minimal value of $k$ such that the goal is attainable for every possible configuration of 4027 points.", "generated_responses": ["To solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum number of lines \\( k \\) required to divide the plane such that no region contains points of both colors. Let's break down the problem step by step.\n\n### Step 1: Understanding the Problem\nWe have 2013 red points and 2014 blue points in the plane. The points are such that no three points are collinear. We need to draw \\( k \\) lines that divide the plane into regions such that no region contains points of both colors.\n\n### Step 2: Analyzing the Points\nSince no three points are collinear, the points form a set of 4027 points in general position. This means that any two points can be connected by a line, and no three points can be on the same line.\n\n### Step 3: Dividing the Plane\nTo divide the plane into regions such that no region contains points of both colors, we need to ensure that the lines we draw separate the red points from the blue points. This implies that the lines must pass through the points in a way that they do not cross each other and do not pass through any point of both colors.\n\n### Step 4: Using the Concept of a Median\nThe median of a set of points is a line that divides the set into two equal-sized subsets. For a set of 4027 points, the median line will pass through the 2014th point when the points are ordered along the line. This line will divide the plane into two regions, each containing 2013 points.\n\n### Step 5: Generalizing the Median\nTo generalize this concept, we need to draw lines that divide the plane into regions such that each region contains points of only one color. We can use the concept of a \"half-plane\" to achieve this.\n\n### Step 6: Using the Half-Plane Concept\nThe half-plane concept implies that we need to draw lines that divide the plane into regions such that each region contains points of only one color. This can be achieved by drawing lines that pass through the points in a way that they do not cross each other and do not pass through any point of both colors.\n\n### Step 7: Calculating the Minimum Number of Lines\nTo find the minimum number of lines required, we need to consider the arrangement of the points. Since the points are in general position, the minimum number of lines required to divide the plane into regions such that no region contains points of both colors is given by the formula:\n\\[\nk = \\left\\lceil \\frac{4027}{2} \\right\\rceil\n\\]\nThis formula ensures that the lines divide the plane into regions such that each region contains points of only one color.\n\n### Step 8: Applying the Formula\nApplying the formula:\n\\[\nk = \\left\\lceil \\frac{4027}{2} \\right\\rceil = \\left\\lceil 2013.5 \\right\\rceil = 2014\n\\]\n\n### Final Answer\nThus, the minimal value of \\( k \\) such that the goal is attainable for every possible configuration of 4027 points is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{2014}\n\\]"], "id": 2064, "generated_answers": ["2014"], "gold_answer": "2013", "is_correct": false, "answers_correctness": [false]}

This pattern can be a checkerboard pattern or a more complex pattern depending on the value of \\( k \\).\n\n### Step 9: Finding the Maximum \\( n \\)\nTo maximize \\( n \\), we need to place the squares in a way that maximizes the number of squares while maintaining the distance condition. The most efficient way to do this is to place the squares in a pattern that repeats every \\( k \\) steps in both the x and y directions.\n\n### Step 10: Verifying the Pattern\nFor \\( k = 2 \\), the pattern is:\n\\[\n\\begin{array}{|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|"], "id": 2124, "generated_answers": [""], "gold_answer": "6", "is_correct": false, "answers_correctness": [false]}

{"question": "Let $\\lfloor x\\rfloor$ represent the greatest integer which is less than or equal to $x$. For example, $\\lfloor 3\\rfloor=3,\\lfloor 2.6\\rfloor=2$. If $x$ is positive and $x\\lfloor x\\rfloor=17$, what is the value of $x$ ?", "generated_responses": ["To solve the problem, we need to find the value of \\( x \\) such that \\( x \\lfloor x \\rfloor = 17 \\) and \\( x \\) is positive. Let's break this down step by step.\n\n1. **Understand the Floor Function**:\n   - The floor function \\( \\lfloor x \\rfloor \\) gives the greatest integer less than or equal to \\( x \\).\n\n2. **Set Up the Equation**:\n   - Let \\( \\lfloor x \\rfloor = n \\), where \\( n \\) is an integer.\n   - Then the equation becomes \\( x \\cdot n = 17 \\).\n\n3. **Express \\( x \\) in Terms of \\( n

n+1 \\), we have:\n     \\[\n     n \\leq \\frac{17}{n} < n+1\n     \\]\n\n5. **Solve the Inequality**:\n   - First, solve \\( n \\leq \\frac{17}{n} \\):\n     \\[\n     n^2 \\leq 17 \\implies n \\leq \\sqrt{17}\n     \\]\n     \\[\n     \\sqrt{17} \\approx 4.123 \\implies n \\leq 4\n     \\]\n   - Next, solve \\( \\frac{17}{n} < n+1 \\):\n     \\[\n     17 < n(n+1)\n     \\]\n     \\[\n     17 <

This is because the sequence of the number of zeros in the terms of the sequence \\( 2, 5, 10, 50, 500, \\ldots \\) is the Fibonacci sequence shifted by 2.\n\n### Step 4: Find the 15th term in the sequence\nTo find the 15th term, we need to determine the number of zeros in the 15th term, which is the 13th Fibonacci number.\n\n### Step 5: Calculate the 13th Fibonacci number\nThe Fibonacci sequence is defined as:\n- \\( F_0 = 0 \\)\n- \\( F_1 = 1 \\)\n- \\( F_n = F_{n-1} + F_{n-2} \\) for \\( n \\geq 2 \\)\n\nWe calculate the first few Fibonacci numbers:\n- \\( F_0 = 0 \\)\n- \\( F_1 = 1 \\)\n- \\( F_2 = 1 \\)\n- \\( F_3 = 2 \\)\n- \\( F_4 = 3 \\)\n- \\( F_5 = 5 \\)\n- \\( F_6 = 8 \\)\n- \\( F_7 = 13 \\)\n- \\( F_8 = 21 \\)\n- \\( F_9 = 34 \\)\n- \\( F_{10} = 55 \\)\n- \\( F_{11} = 89 \\)\n- \\( F_{12} = 144 \\)\n- \\( F_{13} = 233 \\)\n\nThus, the 13th Fibonacci number is 233.\n\n### Conclusion\nThe number of zeros at the end of the 15th term is the 13th Fibonacci number, which is 233.

{"question": "In each town in ARMLandia, the residents have formed groups, which meet each week to share math problems and enjoy each others' company over a potluck-style dinner. Each town resident belongs to exactly one group. Every week, each resident is required to make one dish and to bring it to his/her group.\n\nIt so happens that each resident knows how to make precisely two dishes. Moreover, no two residents of a town know how to make the same pair of dishes. Shown below are two example towns. In the left column are the names of the town's residents. Adjacent to each name is the list of dishes that the corresponding resident knows how to make.\n\n| ARMLton |  |\n| :--- | :--- |\n| Resident | Dishes |\n| Paul | pie, turkey |\n| Arnold | pie, salad |\n| Kelly | salad, broth |\n\n\n| ARMLville |  |\n| :--- | :--- |\n| Resident | Dishes |\n| Sally | steak, calzones |\n| Ross | calzones, pancakes |\n| David | steak, pancakes |\n\nThe population of a town $T$, denoted $\\operatorname{pop}(T)$, is the number of residents of $T$. Formally, the town itself is simply the set of its residents, denoted by $\\left\\{r_{1}, \\ldots, r_{\\mathrm{pop}(T)}\\right\\}$ unless otherwise specified. The set of dishes that the residents of $T$ collectively know how to make is denoted $\\operatorname{dish}(T)$. For example, in the town of ARMLton described above, pop(ARMLton) $=3$, and dish(ARMLton) $=$ \\{pie, turkey, salad, broth\\}.\n\nA town $T$ is called full if for every pair of dishes in $\\operatorname{dish}(T)$, there is exactly one resident in $T$ who knows how to make those two dishes. In the examples above, ARMLville is a full town, but ARMLton is not, because (for example) nobody in ARMLton knows how to make both turkey and salad.\n\nDenote by $\\mathcal{F}_{d}$ a full town in which collectively the residents know how to make $d$ dishes. That is, $\\left|\\operatorname{dish}\\left(\\mathcal{F}_{d}\\right)\\right|=d$.\n\nIn order to avoid the embarrassing situation where two people bring the same dish to a group dinner, if two people know how to make a common dish, they are forbidden from participating in the same group meeting. Formally, a group assignment on $T$ is a function $f: T \\rightarrow\\{1,2, \\ldots, k\\}$, satisfying the condition that if $f\\left(r_{i}\\right)=f\\left(r_{j}\\right)$ for $i \\neq j$, then $r_{i}$ and $r_{j}$ do not know any of the same recipes. The group number of a town $T$, denoted $\\operatorname{gr}(T)$, is the least positive integer $k$ for which there exists a group assignment on $T$.\n\nFor example, consider once again the town of ARMLton. A valid group assignment would be $f($ Paul $)=f($ Kelly $)=1$ and $f($ Arnold $)=2$. The function which gives the value 1 to each resident of ARMLton is not a group assignment, because Paul and Arnold must be assigned to different groups.\n\n\nFor a dish $D$, a resident is called a $D$-chef if he or she knows how to make the dish $D$. Define $\\operatorname{chef}_{T}(D)$ to be the set of residents in $T$ who are $D$-chefs. For example, in ARMLville, David is a steak-chef and a pancakes-chef. Further, $\\operatorname{chef}_{\\text {ARMLville }}($ steak $)=\\{$ Sally, David $\\}$.\n\n\nIf $\\operatorname{gr}(T)=\\left|\\operatorname{chef}_{T}(D)\\right|$ for some $D \\in \\operatorname{dish}(T)$, then $T$ is called homogeneous. If $\\operatorname{gr}(T)>\\left|\\operatorname{chef}_{T}(D)\\right|$ for each dish $D \\in \\operatorname{dish}(T)$, then $T$ is called heterogeneous. For example, ARMLton is homogeneous, because $\\operatorname{gr}($ ARMLton $)=2$ and exactly two chefs make pie, but ARMLville is heterogeneous, because even though each dish is only cooked by two chefs, $\\operatorname{gr}($ ARMLville $)=3$.\n\n\nA resident cycle is a sequence of distinct residents $r_{1}, \\ldots, r_{n}$ such that for each $1 \\leq i \\leq n-1$, the residents $r_{i}$ and $r_{i+1}$ know how to make a common dish, residents $r_{n}$ and $r_{1}$ know how to make a common dish, and no other pair of residents $r_{i}$ and $r_{j}, 1 \\leq i, j \\leq n$ know how to make a common dish. Two resident cycles are indistinguishable if they contain the same residents (in any order), and distinguishable otherwise.

Using the formulas for the \\(n\\)-th terms, we have:\n\\[\na_{20} = a_1 + 19d_1\n\\]\n\\[\nb_{14} = b_1 + 13d_2\n\\]\nThus,\n\\[\na_1 + 19d_1 + b_1 + 13d_2 = 1000\n\\]\n\n### Step 3: Express \\(b_1\\) in terms of \\(a_1\\) and \\(d_1, d_2\\)\nSolving for \\(b_1\\), we get:\n\\[\nb_1 = 1000 - a_1 - 19d_1 - 13d_2\n\\]\n\n### Step 4: Compute \\(b_{20}\\) and \\(a_{14}\\)\nWe need to find the least possible value of \\(b_{20} + a_{14}\\). Using the formulas for the \\(n\\)-th terms, we have:\n\\[\nb_{20} = b_1 + 19d_2 = 1000 - a_1 - 19d_1 - 13d_2 + 19d_2 = 1000 - a_1 - 19d_1 + 6d_2\n\\]\n\\[\na_{14} = a_1 + 13d_1\n\\]\n\n### Step 5: Simplify the expression for \\(b_{20} + a_{14}\\)\nAdding these two expressions, we get:\n\\[\nb_{20} + a_{14} = (1000 - a_1 - 19d_1 + 6d_2) + (a_1 + 13d_1) = 1000 - 6d_1 + 6d_2\n\\]\n\n### Step 6: Minimize the expression\nTo minimize \\(b_{20} + a_{14}\\), we need to maximize \\(d_1\\) and minimize \\(d_2\\). Since \\(a_1, a_2, a_3, \\ldots, a_{20}\\) and \\(b_1, b_2, b_3, \\ldots, b_{20}\\) are distinct positive integers, the smallest possible value for \\(d_2\\) is 1. The smallest possible value for \\(d_1\\) is also 1.\n\nSubstituting \\(d_1 = 1\\) and \\(d_2 = 1\\) into the expression, we get:\n\\[\nb_{20} + a_{14} = 1000 - 6 \\cdot 1 + 6 \\cdot 1 = 1000 - 6 + 6 = 1000\n\\]\n\nHowever, we need to check if this value is achievable with distinct positive integers. If \\(d_1 = 1\\) and \\(d_2 = 1\\), then:\n\\[\na_1 + 19 \\cdot 1 + b_1 + 13 \\cdot 1 = 1000\n\\]\n\\[\na_1 + 19 + b_1 + 13 = 1000\n\\]\n\\[\na_1 + b_1 + 32 = 1000\n\\]\n\\[\na_1 + b_1 = 968\n\\]\n\n### Step 7: Find the minimum value of \\(b_{20} + a_{14}\\)\nTo minimize \\(b_{20} + a_{14}\\), we need to maximize \\(a_1\\) and minimize \\(b_1\\). The smallest possible value for \\(b_1\\) is 1, and the largest possible value for \\(a_1\\) is 967 (since \\(a_1 + b_1 = 968\\)).\n\nSubstituting \\(a_1 = 967\\) and \\(b_1 = 1\\) into the expression for \\(b_{20} + a_{14}\\), we get:\n\\[\nb_{20} + a_{14} = 1000 - 6 \\cdot 1 + 6 \\cdot 1 = 1000 - 6 + 6 = 968\n\\]\n\nThus, the least possible value for \\(b_{20} + a_{14}\\) is \\(\\boxed{968}\\)."], "id": 2646, "generated_answers": ["968"], "gold_answer": "10", "is_correct": false, "answers_correctness": [false]}

On July 17, Shewad Movers arrive and relocate every family from house $n$ to house $n+18$, for all positive $n$ (so that City Hall does not move). For example, the family in house number 17 moves to house number 35.\nRoss takes a walk starting at his house, which is number 34 .

The average value of \\(A + B C + D E F\\) over all permutations is the same as the sum of the average values of \\(A\\), \\(B C\\), and \\(D E F\\) over all permutations.\n\n### Step 6: Calculate the Average Values\n- The average value of \\(A\\) over all permutations is the sum of all the zeros divided by 6:\n  \\[\n  \\text{Average of } A = \\frac{r_1 + r_2 + r_3 + r_4 + r_5 + r_6}{6}\n  \\]\n  By Vieta's formulas, the sum of the zeros of the polynomial \\(f(x) = x^6 + 2x^5 + 3x^4 + 5x^3 + 8x^2 + 13x + 21\\) is given by:\n  \\[\n  r_1 + r_2 + r_3 + r_4 + r_5 + r_6 = -\\frac{\\text{coefficient of } x^5}{\\text{leading coefficient}} = -2\n  \\]\n  Therefore:\n  \\[\n  \\text{Average of } A = \\frac{-2}{6} = -\\frac{1}{3}\n  \\]\n\n- The average value of \\(B C\\) over all permutations is the same as the average value of \\(A\\), because the product of any two zeros is symmetric and the sum of the products of all pairs of zeros is:\n  \\[\n  \\text{Average of } B C = \\frac{r_1 r_2 + r_1 r_3 + r_1 r_4 + r_1 r_5 + r_1 r_6 + r_2 r_3 + r_2 r_4 + r_2 r_5 + r_2 r_6 + r_3 r_4 + r_3 r_5 + r_3 r_6 + r_4 r_5 + r_4 r_6 + r_5 r_6}{6}\n  \\]\n  By Vieta's formulas, the sum of the products of all pairs of zeros is:\n  \\[\n  r_1 r_2 + r_1 r_3 + r_1 r_4 + r_1 r_5 + r_1 r_6 + r_2 r_3 + r_2 r_4 + r_2 r_5 + r_2 r_6 + r_3 r_4 + r_3 r_5 + r_3 r_6 + r_4 r_5 + r_4 r_6 + r_5 r_6 = 3\n  \\]\n  Therefore:\n  \\[\n  \\text{Average of } B C = \\frac{3}{6} = \\frac{1}{2}\n  \\]\n\n- The average value of \\(D E F\\) over all permutations is the same as the average value of \\(A\\), because the product of any three zeros is symmetric and the sum of the products of all triples of zeros is:\n  \\[\n  \\text{Average of } D E F = \\frac{r_1 r_2 r_3 + r_1 r_2 r_4 + r_1 r_2 r_5 + r_1 r_2 r_6 + r_1 r_3 r_4 + r_1 r_3 r_5 + r_1 r_3 r_6 + r_1 r_4 r_5 + r_1 r_4 r_6 + r_1 r_5 r_6 + r_2 r_3 r_4 + r_2 r_3 r_5 + r_2 r_3 r_6 + r_2 r_4 r_5 + r_2 r_4 r_6 + r_2 r_5 r_6 + r_3 r_4 r_5 + r_3 r_4 r_6 + r_3 r_5 r_6 + r_4 r_5 r_6}{6}\n  \\]\n  By Vieta's formulas, the sum of the products of all triples of zeros is:\n  \\[\n  r_1 r_2 r_3 + r_1 r_2 r_4 + r_1 r_2 r_5 + r_1 r_2 r_6 + r_1 r_3 r_4 + r_1 r_3 r_5 + r_1 r_3 r_6 + r_1 r_4 r_5 + r_1 r_4 r_6 + r_1 r_5 r_6 + r_2 r_3 r_4 + r_2 r_3 r_5 + r_2 r_3 r_6 + r_2 r_4 r_5 + r_2 r_4 r_6 + r_2 r_5 r_6 + r_3 r_4 r_5 + r_3 r_4 r_6 + r_3 r_5 r_6 + r_4 r_5 r_6 = 5\n  \\]\n  Therefore:\n  \\[\n  \\text{Average of } D E F = \\frac{5}{6}\n  \\]\n\n### Step 7: Combine the Results\nThe average value of \\(A + B C + D E F\\) is:\n\\[\n\\text{Average of } A + B C + D E F = \\left( -\\frac{1}{3} \\right) + \\left( \\frac{1}{2} \\right) + \\left( \\frac{5}{6} \\right)\n\\]\nTo combine these fractions, we find a common denominator, which is 6:\n\\[\n-\\frac{1}{3} = -\\frac{2}{6}, \\quad \\frac{1}{2} = \\frac{3}{6}\n\\]\nThus:\n\\[\n-\\frac{2}{6} + \\frac{3}{6} + \\frac{5}{6} = \\frac{6}{6} = 1\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the average value of \\(A + B C + D E F\\) over all possible permutations is \\(\\boxed{1}\\)."], "id": 2825, "generated_answers": ["1"], "gold_answer": "$-\\frac{23}{60}$", "is_correct": false, "answers_correctness": [false]}

Let's proceed step by step.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Triangle and Angles\nGiven that \\( \\angle B = \\angle C = 80^\\circ \\), we know that \\( \\angle A = 180^\\circ - 2 \\times 80^\\circ = 20^\\circ \\). This means that \\( \\triangle ABC \\) is isosceles with \\( AB = AC \\).\n\n### Step 2: Define the Isosceles Triangles\nFor \\( \\triangle PAB \\) to be isosceles, we need \\( PA = PB \\) or \\( PA = AB \\) or \\( PB = AB \\). Similarly, for \\( \\triangle PBC \\) to be isosceles, we need \\( PB = PC \\) or \\( PC = BC \\) or \\( PB = BC \\). For \\( \\triangle PCA \\) to be isosceles, we need \\( PC = PA \\) or \\( PA = CA \\) or \\( PC = CA \\).\n\n### Step 3: Consider the Possible Configurations\nWe need to consider all possible configurations where the isosceles triangles can be formed. There are three main cases to consider:\n1. \\( PA = PB \\)\n2. \\( PB = PC \\)\n3. \\( PC = PA \\)\n\n#### Case 1: \\( PA = PB \\)\nIf \\( PA = PB \\), then \\( P \\) lies on the perpendicular bisector of \\( AB \\). Since \\( \\triangle ABC \\) is isosceles with \\( AB = AC \\), the perpendicular bisector of \\( AB \\) is also the angle bisector of \\( \\angle BAC \\). Therefore, \\( P \\) must lie on the angle bisector of \\( \\angle BAC \\).\n\n#### Case 2: \\( PB = PC \\)\nIf \\( PB = PC \\), then \\( P \\) lies on the perpendicular bisector of \\( BC \\). Since \\( \\triangle ABC \\) is isosceles with \\( AB = AC \\), the perpendicular bisector of \\( BC \\) is also the angle bisector of \\( \\angle BAC \\). Therefore, \\( P \\) must lie on the angle bisector of \\( \\angle BAC \\).\n\n#### Case 3: \\( PC = PA \\)\nIf \\( PC = PA \\), then \\( P \\) lies on the perpendicular bisector of \\( AC \\). Since \\( \\triangle ABC \\) is isosceles with \\( AB = AC \\), the perpendicular bisector of \\( AC \\) is also the angle bisector of \\( \\angle BAC \\). Therefore, \\( P \\) must lie on the angle bisector of \\( \\angle BAC \\).\n\n### Step 4: Determine the Intersection Points\nThe angle bisectors of \\( \\angle BAC \\) intersect the sides of the triangle at specific points. Since \\( \\angle BAC = 20^\\circ \\), the angle bisectors will intersect the sides of the triangle at points that divide the angles into two equal angles of \\( 10^\\circ \\) each.\n\n### Step 5: Count the Points\nThe points where the angle bisectors intersect the sides of the triangle are the points where the isosceles triangles can be formed. Since the angle bisectors intersect the sides of the triangle at three distinct points, we have three points \\( P \\) that satisfy the conditions.\n\n### Final Answer\nThus, the number of points \\( P \\) in the plane such that triangles \\( PAB \\), \\( PBC \\), and \\( PCA \\) are all isosceles and non-degenerate is \\(\\boxed{3}\\)."], "id": 2828, "generated_answers": ["3"], "gold_answer": "6", "is_correct": false, "answers_correctness": [false]}

Let's break down the problem step by step.\n\n### Step 1: Total Number of Colorings\nEach face of the cube can be either red or blue, and there are 6 faces. Therefore, the total number of possible colorings is:\n\\[ 2^6 = 64 \\]\n\n### Step 2: Counting Favorable Outcomes\nWe need to count the number of colorings where no three faces of the same color share a common vertex. This means that at each vertex, the three faces meeting at that vertex must not all be the same color.\n\n### Step 3: Counting Colorings Where at Least One Vertex Has All Three Faces the Same Color\nWe will use the principle of complementary counting. First, we count the number of colorings where at least one vertex has all three faces the same color.\n\n#### Case 1: One Vertex Has All Three Faces the Same Color\nThere are 8 vertices in a cube. For each vertex, the three faces meeting at that vertex can be either all red or all blue. The remaining 3 faces can be any color. Therefore, the number of colorings where one vertex has all three faces the same color is:\n\\[ 8 \\times 2 \\times 2^3 = 8 \\times 2 \\times 8 = 128 \\]\n\nHowever, we have overcounted the cases where more than one vertex has all three faces the same color.

Therefore, \\(2016 - 3k = 3m \\implies 2016 - 3k\\) must be a multiple of 3. Since 2016 is a multiple of 3, \\(3k\\) must also be a multiple of 3, which is always true.

This is because the sum of an odd number of odd numbers is even.\n\n3. **Finding the Minimum Number of Minutes:**\n   - We need to find the smallest even number of minutes \\( t \\) such that each switch is flipped exactly \\( t \\) times.\n   - Since there are 6 switches, and each switch must be flipped an odd number of times, the smallest odd number of times each switch can be flipped is 1.\n   - However, flipping each switch exactly 1 time will not result in all switches being on because the switches are not independent. Each switch must be flipped in a way that they all end up on.\n\n4. **Using the Binary Representation:**\n   - We can represent the state of the switches using a binary number where each bit represents the state of a switch (0 for off and 1 for on).\n   - The initial state is 000000.\n   - The goal is to reach 111111.\n\n5. **Calculating the Minimum Number of Steps:**\n   - The minimum number of steps required to change 000000 to 111111 is the number of bits that are different, which is 6.\n   - However, since each switch must be flipped exactly 1 time per minute, the minimum number of minutes required is the number of bits that are different, which is 6.\n\n6. **Conclusion:**\n   - The minimum number of minutes required for Elizabeth to escape is 6.\n\nThus, the final answer is \\(\\boxed{6}\\)."], "id": 2991, "generated_answers": ["6"], "gold_answer": "6", "is_correct": true, "answers_correctness": [true]}
