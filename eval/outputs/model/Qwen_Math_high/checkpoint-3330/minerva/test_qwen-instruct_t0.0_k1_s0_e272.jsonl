{"question": "Buzz, the hot new dining spot on campus, emphasizes simplicity. It only has two items on the menu, burgers and zucchini. Customers make a choice as they enter (they are not allowed to order both), and inform the cooks in the back room by shouting out either \"B\" or \"Z\". Unfortunately the two letters sound similar so $8 \\%$ of the time the cooks misinterpret what was said. The marketing experts who designed the restaurant guess that $90 \\%$ of the orders will be for burgers and $10 \\%$ for zucchini.\nThe cooks can hear one order per second. The customers arrive at the rate of one per second. One of the chefs says that this system will never work because customers can only send one bit per second, the rate at which orders can be accepted, so you could barely keep up even if there were no noise in the channel. You are hired as an outside consultant to deal with the problem.\nWhat is the channel capacity $\\mathrm{C}$ of this communication channel in bits per second?", "generated_responses": ["To determine the channel capacity \\( C \\) of the communication channel at Buzz, we need to consider the following steps:\n\n1. **Identify the probabilities of each order:**\n   -

Let's break it down step by step.\n\n### Subproblem 0: Age of our universe when most He nuclei were formed in minutes\n\n1. **Understanding the Formation of He Nuclei:**\n   - The formation of He nuclei (helium-4) is a key event in the history of the universe.\n   - This event is believed to have occurred when the first stars formed, which is around 100,000 years after the Big Bang.\n\n2. **Converting to Minutes:**\n   - 1 year = 365 days\n   - 1 day = 24 hours\n   - 1 hour = 60 minutes\n   - Therefore, 1 year = 365 * 24 * 60 minutes\n\n3. **Calculating the Total:**\n   - 100,000 years = 100,000 * 365 * 24 * 60 minutes\n   - Simplifying this, we get:\n     \\[\n     100,000 \\times 365 \\times 24 \\times 60 = 100,000 \\times 365 \\times 5760\n     \\]\n   - This is a very large number, but we need to express it in the nearest power of 10.\n\n4. **Simplifying the Calculation:**\n   - 100,000 = 10^5\n   - 365 = 3.65 \\times 10^2\n   - 5760 = 5.76 \\times 10^3\n   - Therefore:\n     \\[\n     10^5 \\times 3.65 \\times 10^2 \\times 5.76 \\times 10^3 = 10^5 \\times 3.65 \\times 5.76 \\times 10^{2+3} = 10^5 \\times 3.65 \\times 5.76 \\times 10^5\n     \\]\n   - Simplifying further:\n     \\[\n     10^5 \\times 3.65 \\times 5.76 \\times 10^5 = 10^{5+5} \\times 3.65 \\times 5.76 = 10^{10} \\times 3.65 \\times 5.76\n     \\]\n   - Since 3.65 \\times 5.76 is a very large number, we can approximate it to the nearest power of 10:\n     \\[\n     3.65 \\times 5.76 \\approx 20.736 \\approx 2 \\times 10^1\n     \\]\n   - Therefore:\n     \\[\n     10^{10} \\times 2 \\times 10^1 = 2 \\times 10^{11}\n     \\]\n\n5. **Final Answer:**\n   - The age of the universe when most He nuclei were formed is approximately \\(2 \\times 10^{11}\\) minutes.\n\n### Subproblem 1: Age of our universe when hydrogen atoms formed in years\n\n1. **Understanding the Formation of Hydrogen Atoms:**\n   - The formation of hydrogen atoms is a key event in the history of the universe.\n   - This event is believed to have occurred when the first stars formed, which is around 100,000 years after the Big Bang.\n\n2. **Converting to Years:**\n   - 1 year = 365 days\n   - 1 day = 24 hours\n   - 1 hour = 60 minutes\n   - Therefore, 1 year = 365 * 24 * 60 minutes\n   - Simplifying this, we get:\n     \\[\n     1 \\text{ year} = 365 \\times 24 \\times 60 = 365 \\times 1460 = 5206000 \\text{ minutes}\n     \\]\n\n3. **Calculating the Total:**\n   - 100,000 years = 100,000 \\times 5206000 minutes\n   - Simplifying this, we get:\n     \\[\n     100,000 \\times 5206000 = 520600000000 \\text{ minutes}\n     \\]\n\n4. **Converting to the Nearest Power of 10:**\n   - 520600000000 = 5.206 \\times 10^{11}\n   - Since 5.206 is very close to 5, we can approximate it to the nearest power of 10:\n     \\[\n     5.206 \\times 10^{11} \\approx 5 \\times 10^{11}\n     \\]\n\n5. **Final Answer:**\n   - The age of the universe when hydrogen atoms formed is approximately \\(5 \\times 10^{11}\\) years.\n\n### Subproblem 2: Age of our universe today in Gyr\n\n1. **Understanding the Current Age of the Universe:**\n   - The current age of the universe is approximately 13.82 billion years.\n   - This is a very large number, but we need to express it in the nearest power of 10.\n\n2. **Converting to Gyr:**\n   - 1 Gyr = 1 billion years\n   - Therefore, 13.82 billion years = 13.82 \\times 10^9 Gyr\n   - Simplifying this, we get:\n     \\[\n     13.82 \\times 10^9 = 1.382 \\times 10^{10} \\text{ Gyr}\n     \\]\n\n3. **Final Answer:**\n   - The age of the universe today is approximately \\(1.382 \\times 10^{10}\\) Gyr.\n\n### Final Answer\n\\boxed{1}"], "generated_answers": ["1"], "gold_answer": "10", "is_correct": false, "answers_correctness": [false]}
