The left-hand side is the polynomial \\( x^2 + 7 \\), which is a quadratic polynomial with a constant term of 7. The right-hand side is a sum of squares of polynomials with rational coefficients.\n\n### Step 1: Consider the Degree of the Polynomials\nThe degree of the polynomial \\( x^2 + 7 \\) is 2. Since each \\( f_i(x) \\) is a polynomial with rational coefficients, the degree of \\( f_i(x)^2 \\) is twice the degree of \\( f_i(x) \\). Therefore, the degree of the sum of squares of polynomials \\( f_1(x)^2 + f_2(x)^2 + \\cdots + f_n(x)^2 \\) is at most 2, because the highest degree term will be the sum of the highest degree terms of each square polynomial.\n\n### Step 2: Form of the Polynomials\nGiven that the degree of the sum of squares of polynomials must be at most 2, each \\( f_i(x) \\) must be a linear polynomial.

For \\( f(m) + n \\) to be small, \\( f(m) \\) must be small compared to \\( n \\). This suggests that \\( f(m) \\) must be a function that grows very rapidly compared to \\( n \\).\n\n### Step 3: Analyzing the Expression \\( f(n) + m \\)\nSimilarly, for \\( f(n) + m \\) to be small, \\( f(n) \\) must be small compared to \\( m \\). This suggests that \\( f(n) \\) must be a function that grows very rapidly compared to \\( m \\).\n\n### Step 4: Combining the Conditions\nTo satisfy the condition \\(\\operatorname{gcd}(f(m) + n, f(n) + m) \\leq k\\), both \\( f(m) + n \\) and \\( f(n) + m \\) must be small. This implies that \\( f(m) \\) and \\( f(n) \\) must be very close to each other for the gcd to be small.\n\n### Step 5: Constructing a \\( k \\)-Good Function\nTo construct a \\( k \\)-good function, we need to find a function \\( f \\) such that for any \\( m \\neq n \\), the gcd of \\( f(m) + n \\) and \\( f(n) + m \\) is at most \\( k \\).\n\nOne approach is to consider the function \\( f(n) = n^2 \\). Let's check if \\( f(n) = n^2 \\) is \\( k \\)-good for some \\( k \\).\n\n### Step 6: Checking the Function \\( f(n) = n^2 \\)\nFor \\( f(n) = n^2 \\), we have:\n\\[\nf(m) + n = m^2 + n\n\\]\n\\[\nf(n) + m = n^2 + m\n\\]\n\nWe need to find the gcd of \\( m^2 + n \\) and \\( n^2 + m \\). Notice that:\n\\[\nm^2 + n \\quad \\text{and} \\quad n^2 + m\n\\]\n\n### Step 7: Using the Euclidean Algorithm\nTo find the gcd, we use the Euclidean algorithm:\n\\[\n\\gcd(m^2 + n, n^2 + m) = \\gcd(m^2 + n, (n^2 + m) - (m^2 + n)) = \\gcd(m^2 + n, n^2 - m^2) = \\gcd(m^2 + n, (n - m)(n + m))\n\\]\n\nSince \\( m \\neq n \\), we have:\n\\[\n\\gcd(m^2 + n, (n - m)(n + m)) = \\gcd(m^2 + n, n + m)\n\\]\n\n### Step 8: Simplifying the Expression\nFor \\( m \\neq n \\), \\( \\gcd(m^2 + n, n + m) \\) must be a divisor of \\( n + m \\). Since \\( m \\neq n \\), \\( \\gcd(m^2 + n, n + m) \\) must be 1 or a small number. This implies that \\( m^2 + n \\) and \\( n + m \\) must be coprime for large \\( k \\).\n\n### Step 9: Conclusion\nFor \\( f(n) = n^2 \\) to be \\( k \\)-good, \\( k \\) must be such that the gcd of \\( m^2 + n \\) and \\( n + m \\) is at most \\( k \\). This is true for \\( k = 1 \\) and \\( k = 2 \\), but not for \\( k = 3 \\) or higher, as the expressions \\( m^2 + n \\) and \\( n + m \\) are not always coprime for larger \\( k \\).\n\nThus, the values of \\( k \\) for which there exists a \\( k \\)-good function are:\n\\[\n\\boxed{1, 2}\n\\]"], "id": 1964, "generated_answers": ["1, 2"], "gold_answer": "$k \\geqslant 2$", "is_correct": false, "answers_correctness": [false]}

The rule we need to define should be based on the relative order of the cards and should not depend on the specific numbers on the cards.\n\n### Step 2: Analyzing the Conditions\n1. **The winner only depends on the relative order of the 200 cards.**\n   - This means the rule should be based on the sequence of the 200 cards, not on the specific numbers on the cards.\n\n2. **If the cards are laid down in increasing order face down and we are given which card belongs to which player, but not the numbers, we can still decide the winner.**\n   - This implies that the rule should be based on the order of the cards and the information about the players' positions.\n\n3. **If we write the elements of both sets in increasing order as \\( A = \\{a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_{100}\\} \\) and \\( B = \\{b_1, b_2, \\ldots, b_{100}\\} \\), and \\( a_i > b_i \\) for all \\( i \\), then \\( A \\) beats \\( B \\).**\n   - This means the rule should be based on the comparison of the elements of the sets \\( A \\) and \\( B \\).\n\n4. **If three players draw three disjoint sets \\( A, B, C \\) from the deck, \\( A \\) beats \\( B \\) and \\( B \\) beats \\( C \\), then \\( A \\) also beats \\( C \\).**\n   - This implies that the rule should be consistent and transitive.\n\n### Step 3: Constructing the Rule\nTo satisfy all these conditions, the rule must be based on the comparison of the elements of the sets \\( A \\) and \\( B \\). The simplest and most consistent rule is to compare the smallest elements of the sets \\( A \\) and \\( B \\).\n\n### Step 4: Verifying the Rule\n- **Comparing the smallest elements of \\( A \\) and \\( B \\):**\n  - If the smallest element in \\( A \\) is less than the smallest element in \\( B \\), then \\( A \\) beats \\( B \\).\n  - If the smallest element in \\( B \\) is less than the smallest element in \\( A \\), then \\( B \\) beats \\( A \\).\n  - If the smallest elements are equal, the rule must be based on the next smallest elements, and so on.\n\n### Step 5: Counting the Ways\nThe rule can be defined in many ways depending on the specific elements in the sets \\( A \\) and \\( B \\). However, the simplest and most consistent rule is the one that compares the smallest elements.\n\n### Step 6: Conclusion\nThere is exactly one consistent rule that satisfies all the given conditions.

This means that the distance between the centers of the boxes must be less than the sum of their radii and greater than the absolute difference of their radii.\n\n### Step 2: Representing the Boxes\nLet's represent each box \\( B_i \\) as a rectangle with center \\((i, i)\\) and radius \\( r_i \\).

For example:\n- \\( f(1) = 1 \\) (the number is 5)\n- \\( f(2) = 2 \\) (the numbers are 14 and 23)\n- \\( f(3) = 3 \\) (the numbers are 113, 122, and 131)\n\n### Step 2: Units digit of \\( f(n) \\)\nWe need to find the units digit of \\( f(n) \\) for each \\( n \\) from 1 to 2014 and count how many times the units digit is 1.\n\n### Step 3: Pattern in units digits of \\( f(n) \\)\nLet's observe the units digits of \\( f(n) \\) for small values of \\( n \\):\n- \\( f(1) = 5 \\) (units digit is 5)\n- \\( f(2) = 2 \\) (units digit is 2)\n- \\( f(3) = 3 \\) (units digit is 3)\n- \\( f(4) = 1 \\) (units digit is 1)\n- \\( f(5) = 5 \\) (units digit is 5)\n- \\( f(6) = 2 \\) (units digit is 2)\n- \\( f(7) = 3 \\) (units digit is 3)\n- \\( f(8) = 1 \\) (units digit is 1)\n\nWe observe that the units digits repeat every 4 values: 5, 2, 3, 1.\n\n### Step 4: Counting the units digit 1\nTo count the number of times the units digit is 1, we need to count the numbers from 1 to 2014 that have a units digit of 1.

Consider the random variables \\(X = a_{2k-1}\\) and \\(Y = a_{2k}\\). The expected value of \\(\\left|X - Y\\right|\\) can be expressed as:\n\n\\[\n\\mathbb{E}[\\left|X - Y\\right|] = \\mathbb{E}[X - Y] + \\mathbb{E}[-(X - Y)]\n\\]\n\nSince \\(X\\) and \\(Y\\) are symmetric around their mean, \\(\\mathbb{E}[X - Y] = 0\\).

This property extends to repunits as well.\n\n### Step 6: Calculate the Sum of the Digits of the Product\n- The sum of the digits of \\( 888,888 \\) is \\( 6 \\).\n- The sum of the digits of \\( 9,999,999 \\) is \\( 9 \\).\n\nThus, the sum of the digits of the product \\( 888,888 \\times 9,999,999 \\) is:\n\\[\n6 + 9 = 15\n\\]\n\n### Step 7: Verify the Pattern\nTo verify, we can check the product of the first few repunits:\n- \\( 1 \\times 1 = 1 \\) (sum of digits: \\( 1 \\))\n- \\( 11 \\times 11 = 121 \\) (sum of digits: \\( 1 + 2 + 1 = 4 \\))\n- \\( 111 \\times 111 = 12321 \\) (sum of digits: \\( 1 + 2 + 3 + 2 + 1 = 9 \\))\n- \\( 1111 \\times 1111 = 1234321 \\) (sum of digits: \\( 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 3 + 2 + 1 = 15 \\))\n\n### Step 8: Conclusion\nFrom the pattern and the calculations, we see that the sum of the digits of \\( 888,888 \\times 9,999,999 \\) is indeed \\( 15 \\).\n\nThus, the final answer is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{15}\n\\]"], "id": 2733, "generated_answers": ["15"], "gold_answer": "63", "is_correct": false, "answers_correctness": [false]}

This is because the maximum number of intersection points between two triangles is 3, and for equilateral triangles, this maximum is achievable.\n\n2. **Total Number of Pairs of Triangles:**\n   - We have 5 equilateral triangles, and we need to find the maximum number of unique intersection points.

Therefore, the equation becomes:\n\\[\nz = \\frac{3 + \\left\\lfloor z^2 \\right\\rfloor}{4}\n\\]\n\nNext, we need to understand the behavior of the floor function \\( \\left\\lfloor z^2 \\right\\rfloor \\).

{"question": "David builds a circular table; he then carves one or more positive integers into the table at points equally spaced around its circumference. He considers two tables to be the same if one can be rotated so that it has the same numbers in the same positions as the other. For example, a table with the numbers $8,4,5$ (in clockwise order) is considered the same as a table with the numbers 4, 5,8 (in clockwise order), but both tables are different from a table with the numbers 8, 5, 4 (in clockwise order). Given that the numbers he carves sum to 17 , compute the number of different tables he can make.", "generated_responses": ["To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of different circular tables David can make with the numbers 1 through 17, where the sum of the numbers on the table is 17. We will consider the problem step by step.\n\n### Step 1: Understanding the Problem\nA circular table can be rotated in 17 different ways (0, 1, 2, ..., 16 positions). Each rotation of the table results in the same arrangement. Therefore, we need to count the number of distinct arrangements of the numbers 1 through 17 that sum to 17.\n\n### Step 2: Sum of the Numbers\nThe sum of the numbers from 1 to 17 is:\n\\[\n1 + 2 + 3 + \\cdots + 17 = \\frac{17 \\cdot 18}{2} = 153\n\\]\nHowever, since the table is circular and rotations are considered the same, we need to find the number of distinct arrangements modulo 17.\n\n### Step 3: Modulo 17\nWe need to find the number of distinct arrangements of the numbers 1 through 17 modulo 17. This is equivalent to finding the number of distinct arrangements of the numbers 0 through 16 modulo 17.\n\n### Step 4: Counting Distinct Arrangements\nTo count the number of distinct arrangements, we need to consider the symmetries of the circular table. The symmetries are the rotations and reflections, which form the dihedral group of order 34.\n\n### Step 5: Using Burnside's Lemma\nBurnside's Lemma helps us count the number of distinct arrangements by considering the fixed arrangements under the symmetries. We need to count the number of arrangements that remain unchanged under each rotation and reflection.\n\n### Step 6: Counting Fixed Arrangements\nFor each rotation or reflection, we need to count the number of arrangements that remain unchanged. This is a combinatorial problem, and the number of such arrangements is 2 for each rotation or reflection.\n\n### Step 7: Applying Burnside's Lemma\nBurnside's Lemma states that the number of distinct arrangements is the average number of fixed arrangements over all symmetries. Since there are 34 symmetries, and each symmetry has 2 fixed arrangements, we have:\n\\[\n\\text{Number of distinct arrangements} = \\frac{34 \\cdot 2}{34} = 2\n\\]\n\n### Step 8: Conclusion\nThus, the number of different tables David can make is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{2}\n\\]"], "id": 2767, "generated_answers": ["2"], "gold_answer": "7711", "is_correct": false, "answers_correctness": [false]}

Therefore, \\( n! \\) must include:\n- At most 1006 factors of 2\n- At most 671 factors of 3\n- At most 12 factors of 167\n\n### Step 5: Determine the Maximum \\( n \\)\nTo find the maximum \\( n \\) such that \\( n! \\) fits within these constraints, we need to find the largest \\( n \\) such that the sum of the exponents of 2, 3, and 167 in \\( n! \\) is at most 1006, 671, and 12, respectively.\n\n- The exponents of 2 in \\( n! \\) are \\( \\left\\lfloor \\frac{n}{2} \\right\\rfloor + \\left\\lfloor \\frac{n}{4} \\right\\rfloor + \\left\\lfloor \\frac{n}{8} \\right\\rfloor + \\cdots \\).\n- The exponents of 3 in \\( n! \\) are \\( \\left\\lfloor \\frac{n}{3} \\right\\rfloor + \\left\\lfloor \\frac{n}{9} \\right\\rfloor + \\left\\lfloor \\frac{n}{27} \\right\\rfloor + \\cdots \\).\n- The exponents of 167 in \\( n! \\) are \\( \\left\\lfloor \\frac{n}{167} \\right\\rfloor + \\left\\lfloor \\frac{n}{167^2} \\right\\rfloor + \\left\\lfloor \\frac{n}{167^3} \\right\\rfloor + \\cdots \\).\n\nWe need to find the largest \\( n \\) such that:\n\\[\n\\left\\lfloor \\frac{n}{2} \\right\\rfloor + \\left\\lfloor \\frac{n}{4} \\right\\rfloor + \\left\\lfloor \\frac{n}{8} \\right\\rfloor + \\cdots \\leq 1006\n\\]\n\\[\n\\left\\lfloor \\frac{n}{3} \\right\\rfloor + \\left\\lfloor \\frac{n}{9} \\right\\rfloor + \\left\\lfloor \\frac{n}{27} \\right\\rfloor + \\cdots \\leq 671\n\\]\n\\[\n\\left\\lfloor \\frac{n}{167} \\right\\rfloor + \\left\\lfloor \\frac{n}{167^2} \\right\\rfloor + \\left\\lfloor \\frac{n}{167^3} \\right\\rfloor + \\cdots \\leq 12\n\\]\n\n### Step 6: Approximate \\( n \\)\nWe can approximate \\( n \\) by solving the inequalities:\n\\[\n\\left\\lfloor \\frac{n}{2} \\right\\rfloor \\approx 1006\n\\]\n\\[\n\\left\\lfloor \\frac{n}{3} \\right\\rfloor \\approx 671\n\\]\n\\[\n\\left\\lfloor \\frac{n}{167} \\right\\rfloor \\approx 12\n\\]\n\nSolving these, we get:\n\\[\nn \\approx 2012\n\\]\n\n### Step 7: Verify \\( n = 2012 \\)\nFor \\( n = 2012 \\):\n- The exponents of 2 in \\( 2012! \\) are \\( 1006 \\).\n- The exponents of 3 in \\( 2012! \\) are \\( 671 \\).\n- The exponents of 167 in \\( 2012! \\) are \\( 12 \\).\n\nSince these exponents are all within the constraints, \\( 2012! \\) divides \\( 2012! \\).\n\n### Step 8: Conclusion\nThe number of positive integers \\( n \\) such that \\( n! \\) divides \\( 2012! \\) is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{3013}\n\\]"], "id": 2793, "generated_answers": ["3013"], "gold_answer": "1510", "is_correct": false, "answers_correctness": [false]}

There are 6 faces, and each face is extended by 1 unit outward.\n\n   - The two \\(8 \\times 10\\) faces contribute:\n     \\[\n     2 \\times (8 \\times 10 \\times 1) = 160\n     \\]\n   - The two \\(8 \\times 12\\) faces contribute:\n     \\[\n     2 \\times (8 \\times 12 \\times 1) = 96\n     \\]\n   - The two \\(10 \\times 12\\) faces contribute:\n     \\[\n     2 \\times (10 \\times 12 \\times 1) = 120\n     \\]\n\n   The total volume of the regions within 1 unit of a face is:\n   \\[\n   160 + 96 + 120 = 376\n   \\]\n\n3. **Calculate the volume of the region not within 1 unit of any face:**\n   The volume of the region not within 1 unit of any face is the total volume of the box minus the volume of the regions within 1 unit of a face:\n   \\[\n   960 - 376 = 584\n   \\]\n\n4. **Determine the fraction of the volume not within 1 unit of any face:**\n   The fraction of the volume not within 1 unit of any face is:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{584}{960}\n   \\]\n\n5. **Simplify the fraction:**\n   To simplify \\(\\frac{584}{960}\\), we find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 584 and 960. The GCD of 584 and 960 is 16. Therefore:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{584 \\div 16}{960 \\div 16} = \\frac{37}{60}\n   \\]\n\nThus, the fraction of the box's volume that is not within 1 unit of any of the box's faces is \\(\\boxed{\\frac{37}{60}}\\)."], "id": 2855, "generated_answers": ["\\frac{37}{60}"], "gold_answer": "$\\frac{1}{2}$", "is_correct": false, "answers_correctness": [false]}

The side length \\(s\\) of the square can be found using the formula for the area of a square:\n\\[\ns^2 = 650\n\\]\nTaking the square root of both sides:\n\\[\ns = \\sqrt{650} = \\sqrt{25 \\times 26} = 5\\sqrt{26}\n\\]\n\n### Step 2: Identify the coordinates of the vertices of the square\nSince \\(A\\) is at \\((11, 5)\\), and \\(A, R, M, L\\) are midpoints of the sides of the square, we need to find the coordinates of the vertices of the square.

The vertices of the cube are at \\((0,0,0)\\), \\((1,0,0)\\), \\((0,1,0)\\), \\((1,1,0)\\), \\((0,0,1)\\), \\((1,0,1)\\), \\((0,1,1)\\), and \\((1,1,1)\\).\n\n### Step 3: Distance from a Point to a Vertex\nThe distance from a point \\((x, y, z)\\) to a vertex \\((0,0,0)\\) is:\n\\[\n\\sqrt{x^2 + y^2 + z^2}.\n\\]\nSimilarly, the distance from \\((x, y, z)\\) to the vertex \\((1,0,0)\\) is:\n\\[\n\\sqrt{(1-x)^2 + y^2 + z^2}.\n\\]\nThe distance from \\((x, y, z)\\) to the vertex \\((0,1,0)\\) is:\n\\[\n\\sqrt{x^2 + (1-y)^2 + z^2}.\n\\]\nThe distance from \\((x, y, z)\\) to the vertex \\((1,1,0)\\) is:\n\\[\n\\sqrt{(1-x)^2 + (1-y)^2 + z^2}.\n\\]\nThe distance from \\((x, y, z)\\) to the vertex \\((0,0,1)\\) is:\n\\[\n\\sqrt{x^2 + y^2 + (1-z)^2}.\n\\]\nThe distance from \\((x, y, z)\\) to the vertex \\((1,0,1)\\) is:\n\\[\n\\sqrt{(1-x)^2 + y^2 + (1-z)^2}.\n\\]\nThe distance from \\((x, y, z)\\) to the vertex \\((0,1,1)\\) is:\n\\[\n\\sqrt{x^2 + (1-y)^2 + (1-z)^2.\n\\]\nThe distance from \\((x, y, z)\\) to the vertex \\((1,1,1)\\) is:\n\\[\n\\sqrt{(1-x)^2 + (1-y)^2 + (1-z)^2}.\n\\]\n\n### Step 4: Condition for a Point to be Removed\nA point \\((x, y, z)\\) is removed if the minimum of these distances is less than \\(\\frac{3}{5}\\). This means:\n\\[\n\\min\\left(\\sqrt{x^2 + y^2 + z^2}, \\sqrt{(1-x)^2 + y^2 + z^2}, \\sqrt{x^2 + (1-y)^2 + z^2}, \\sqrt{(1-x)^2 + (1-y)^2 + z^2}, \\sqrt{x^2 + y^2 + (1-z)^2}, \\sqrt{(1-x)^2 + y^2 + (1-z)^2}, \\sqrt{x^2 + (1-y)^2 + (1-z)^2}, \\sqrt{(1-x)^2 + (1-y)^2 + (1-z)^2}\\right) < \\frac{3}{5}.\n\\]\n\n### Step 5: Simplifying the Condition\nThis condition is complex to handle directly, but we can use the fact that the region \\(\\mathcal{R}\\) is symmetric and can be simplified by considering the geometry of the cube and the spheres of radius \\(\\frac{3}{5}\\) centered at the vertices.\n\n### Step 6: Volume of the Region \\(\\mathcal{R}\\)\nThe volume of the cube is 1. The volume of a sphere of radius \\(\\frac{3}{5}\\) is:\n\\[\n\\frac{4}{3} \\pi \\left(\\frac{3}{5}\\right)^3 = \\frac{4}{3} \\pi \\left(\\frac{27}{125}\\right) = \\frac{108}{125} \\pi.\n\\]\nThe volume of the region \\(\\mathcal{R}\\) is the volume of the cube minus the volume of the region occupied by the spheres centered at the vertices. However, this approach is incorrect because the regions are not simply subtracted.\n\n### Step 7: Correct Approach\nThe correct approach is to recognize that the region \\(\\mathcal{R}\\) is a polyhedron that can be divided into simpler shapes.

Therefore, we need:\n\\[ n+1 = p_1 \\cdot q_1 \\]\n\\[ n+2 = p_2 \\cdot q_2 \\]\nwhere \\( p_1, q_1, p_2, \\) and \\( q_2 \\) are prime numbers.\n\n### Step 3: Analyze the possible values of \\( n \\)\nWe will start by testing small prime numbers for \\( p \\) and \\( q \\) to find \\( n \\).\n\n#### Case 1: \\( p = 2 \\)\n- If \\( p = 2 \\), then \\( n = 2q \\).\n- \\( n+1 = 2q + 1 \\) must be a product of two primes.\n- \\( n+2 = 2q + 2 \\) must be a product of two primes.\n\nLet's check for small primes \\( q \\):\n- \\( q = 3 \\): \\( n = 6 \\)\n  -

If $1 \\leq n \\leq 7$, compute the number of such polynomials such that $\\operatorname{GCD}\\left(a_{0}, a_{1}, \\ldots, a_{n}\\right)=1$.", "generated_responses": ["To solve this problem, we need to analyze the conditions given and determine how many such polynomials exist for each degree \\( n \\) from 1 to 7. Let's break down the problem step by step.\n\n### Step 1: Understanding the Problem\nA polynomial \\( P(x) = a_n x^n + a_{n-1} x^{n-1} + \\cdots + a_1 x + a_0 \\) with integer coefficients is read backwards as \\( Q(x) = a_0 x^n + a_{n-1} x^{n-1} + \\cdots + a_1 x + a_n \\). We need to find the number of such polynomials where the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the coefficients \\( a_0, a_1, \\ldots, a_n \\) is 1.\n\n### Step 2: Analyzing the Zeros\nSince the zeros of \\( Q(x) \\) are the same as the zeros of \\( P(x) \\), and they are all real and integers, \\( Q(x) \\) must be a permutation of \\( P(x) \\). This means that the set of coefficients \\( a_0, a_1, \\ldots, a_n \\) must be a permutation of the set \\( a_n, a_{n-1}, \\ldots, a_1, a_0 \\).\n\n### Step 3: Conditions for the Coefficients\nFor \\( Q(x) \\) to be a permutation of \\( P(x) \\), the leading coefficient \\( a_n \\) must be a permutation of the constant term \\( a_0 \\), and the constant term \\( a_0 \\) must be a permutation of the leading coefficient \\( a_n \\). This implies that \\( a_n \\) and \\( a_0 \\) must be the same up to a permutation. Since \\( a_n \\) and \\( a_0 \\) are integers, the only possible values are \\( a_n = a_0 \\) or \\( a_n = -a_0 \\).\n\n### Step 4: GCD Condition\nWe need to ensure that the GCD of the coefficients \\( a_0, a_1, \\ldots, a_n \\) is 1. If \\( a_n = a_0 \\), then the GCD of \\( a_0, a_1, \\ldots, a_n \\) is \\( a_0 \\), which must be 1. If \\( a_n = -a_0 \\), then the GCD of \\( a_0, a_1, \\ldots, a_n \\) is \\( |a_0| \\), which must be 1. Therefore, \\( a_0 \\) must be \\( \\pm 1 \\).\n\n### Step 5: Counting the Polynomials\nWe need to count the number of such polynomials for each degree \\( n \\) from 1 to 7.\n\n- For \\( n = 1 \\): \\( a_0 = \\pm 1 \\).
