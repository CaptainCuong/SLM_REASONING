Divide the unit square \\(U\\) into \\(4n\\) smaller squares, each of side length \\(\\frac{1}{2}\\).

A configuration is good if no two arrows cross and there are no arrows \\(\\overrightarrow{A B}\\) and \\(\\overrightarrow{C D}\\) such that \\(A B C D\\) is a convex quadrangle oriented clockwise.\n\n### Step 1: Understanding the Configuration\nWe have \\(2n\\) distinct points on a circumference, and we split these points into \\(n\\) pairs. Each pair is connected by an arrow (an oriented line segment). The configuration is good if:\n1. No two arrows cross.\n2. There are no arrows \\(\\overrightarrow{A B}\\) and \\(\\overrightarrow{C D}\\) such that \\(A B C D\\) forms a convex quadrangle oriented clockwise.\n\n### Step 2: Counting the Total Number of Configurations\nFirst, we count the total number of ways to pair the \\(2n\\) points and assign an orientation to each pair. The number of ways to pair \\(2n\\) points is given by:\n\\[\n(2n-1)!! = (2n-1)(2n-3)(2n-5)\\cdots3 \\cdot 1\n\\]\nThis is because the first point can be paired with any of the \\(2n-1\\) remaining points, the second point can be paired with any of the \\(2n-3\\) remaining points, and so on.\n\nFor each pair, there are 2 possible orientations (clockwise or counterclockwise). Therefore, the total number of configurations is:\n\\[\n(2n-1)!! \\cdot 2^n\n\\]\n\n### Step 3: Counting the Number of Crossings\nNext, we count the number of configurations where at least one pair of arrows cross. We use the principle of inclusion-exclusion to do this.\n\n- **One pair crosses**: Choose 1 pair to cross, and there are \\(2n-1\\) ways to choose this pair. The remaining \\(n-1\\) pairs can be oriented in \\(2^{n-1}\\) ways. Thus, the number of configurations with exactly one pair crossing is:\n\\[\n2n-1 \\cdot 2^{n-1}\n\\]\n\n- **Two pairs cross**: Choose 2 pairs to cross, and there are \\(\\binom{n}{2}\\) ways to choose these pairs.

We need to choose 4 points (2 pairs) and assign them to form a clockwise quadrangle. There are \\(\\binom{2n}{4}\\) ways to choose 4 points, and for each set of 4 points, there are 2 ways to form a clockwise quadrangle (since the remaining \\(n-2\\) pairs can be oriented in \\(2^{n-2}\\) ways).\n\nThus, the number of configurations with at least one clockwise quadrangle is:\n\\[\n\\binom{2n}{4} \\cdot 2 \\cdot 2^{n-2} = \\binom{2n}{4} \\cdot 2^{n-1}\n\\]\n\n### Step 5: Counting the Number of Crossings and Clockwise Quadrangles\nFinally, we count the number of configurations that have both at least one pair of arrows crossing and at least one clockwise quadrangle. We use the principle of inclusion-exclusion again.\n\n- **One pair crosses and one clockwise quadrangle**: Choose 1 pair to cross and 1 set of 4 points to form a clockwise quadrangle. The remaining \\(n-2\\) pairs can be oriented in \\(2^{n-2}\\) ways. Thus, the number of configurations is:\n\\[\n2n-1 \\cdot \\binom{2n}{4} \\cdot 2^{n-2}\n\\]\n\n- **Two pairs cross and one clockwise quadrangle**: Choose 2 pairs to cross and 1 set of 4 points to form a clockwise quadrangle. The remaining \\(n-3\\) pairs can be oriented in \\(2^{n-3}\\) ways. Thus, the number of configurations is:\n\\[\n\\binom{n}{2} \\cdot \\binom{2n}{4} \\cdot 2^{n-3}\n\\]\n\n- **General case**: The number of configurations with exactly \\(k\\) pairs crossing and at least one clockwise quadrangle is:\n\\[\n\\binom{n}{k} \\cdot \\binom{2n}{4} \\cdot 2^{n-k-1}\n\\]\n\nUsing inclusion-exclusion, the number of configurations with at least one pair of arrows crossing and at least one clockwise quadrangle is:\n\\[\n\\sum_{k=1}^{n} (-1)^{k} \\binom{n}{k} \\binom{2n}{4} 2^{n-k-1}\n\\]\n\n### Step 6: Calculating the Number of Good Configurations\nThe number of good configurations is the total number of configurations minus the number of configurations with at least one pair of arrows crossing and the number of configurations with at least one clockwise quadrangle plus the number of configurations with both at least one pair of arrows crossing and at least one clockwise quadrangle.\n\nThus, the number of good configurations is:\n\\[\n(2n-1)!! \\cdot 2^n - \\sum_{k=1}^{n} (-1)^{k+1} \\binom{n}{k} 2^{n-k} - \\binom{2n}{4} \\cdot 2^{n-1} + \\sum_{k=1}^{n} (-1)^{k} \\binom{n}{k} \\binom{2n}{4} 2^{n-k-1}\n\\]\n\nSimplifying this, we find that the number of good configurations is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{2^n}\n\\]"], "id": 1641, "generated_answers": ["2^n"], "gold_answer": "$\\binom{2n}{n}$", "is_correct": false, "answers_correctness": [false]}

When two ants moving in opposite directions meet, they both turn \\(90^\\circ\\) clockwise and continue moving with speed 1. When more than two ants meet, or when two ants moving in perpendicular directions meet, the ants continue moving in the same direction as before they met.\n\n### Step 2: Analyzing the Geometry\nThe checkerboard is an \\(m \\times m\\) grid of unit squares. The midpoints of the unit squares form a grid of \\((m-1) \\times (m-1)\\) unit squares. Each ant starts at one of these midpoints and moves in a direction parallel to one of the edges of the checkerboard.\n\n### Step 3: Conditions for an Ant to Fall Off\nAn ant falls off the checkerboard if it reaches one of the edges. This means the ant must move in such a way that it aligns with the edge of the checkerboard. The key insight is that an ant will fall off if it moves in a direction that is perpendicular to its initial direction.\n\n### Step 4: Using Permutations and Combinatorics\nWe need to consider all possible starting positions and directions. Each ant can start at any of the \\((m-1) \\times (m-1)\\) midpoints and move in one of 4 directions (up, down, left, right). We need to find the maximum time at which the last ant falls off.\n\n### Step 5: Calculating the Time\nThe time taken by an ant to fall off is determined by the number of steps it takes to align with the edge. If an ant starts at a midpoint \\((i, j)\\) and moves in a direction that is perpendicular to its initial direction, it will take \\(i + j\\) steps to fall off (since it needs to move \\(i\\) steps horizontally and \\(j\\) steps vertically to align with the edge).\n\n### Step 6: Finding the Maximum Time\nTo find the maximum time, we need to consider the worst-case scenario. The worst-case scenario is when an ant starts at a midpoint \\((i, j)\\) such that \\(i + j\\) is maximized. This occurs when \\(i = m-1\\) and \\(j = m-1\\), which gives \\(i + j = 2(m-1)\\).\n\n### Step 7: Conclusion\nThe maximum time at which the last ant falls off is \\(2(m-1)\\).

The total number of diagonals in an \\( n \\)-gon is given by:\n\\[\n\\frac{n(n-3)}{2}\n\\]\nFor a 2006-gon:\n\\[\n\\frac{2006 \\times 2003}{2} = 2006 \\times 1001.5 = 2006 \\times 1001 = 2006003\n\\]\nHowever, we are given that the 2006-gon has been dissected into triangles by 2003 nonintersecting diagonals. This means the 2006-gon has been divided into 2004 triangles (since each diagonal adds one more triangle).\n\n### Step 2: Types of Diagonals\nDiagonals can be either even or odd. An even diagonal divides the boundary into two parts, each composed of an even number of sides. An odd diagonal divides the boundary into two parts, each composed of an odd number of sides.\n\n### Step 3: Counting Odd Diagonals\nTo maximize the number of isosceles triangles with two odd sides, we need to consider the properties of these triangles. An isosceles triangle with two odd sides must have an even base (since the sum of two odd numbers is even).\n\n### Step 4: Using Euler's Formula\nEuler's formula for a polyhedron states:\n\\[\nV - E + F = 2\n\\]\nwhere \\( V \\) is the number of vertices, \\( E \\) is the number of edges, and \\( F \\) is the number of faces. For a 2006-gon:\n\\[\nV = 2006, \\quad E = 2006003, \\quad F = 2004\n\\]\nWe need to find the number of odd diagonals. Let \\( O \\) be the number of odd diagonals and \\( E \\) be the number of even diagonals. We have:\n\\[\nO + E = 2006003\n\\]\nUsing Euler's formula:\n\\[\n2006 - 2006003 + 2004 = 2\n\\]\nSimplifying:\n\\[\n2006 - 2006003 + 2004 = 2 \\implies 2006 - 2006003 + 2004 = 2 \\implies 2006 - 2006003 + 2004 = 2\n\\]\nThis simplifies to:\n\\[\n2006 - 2006003 + 2004 = 2 \\implies 2006 - 2006003 + 2004 = 2 \\implies 2006 - 2006003 + 2004 = 2\n\\]\n\n### Step 5: Maximizing Isosceles Triangles\nTo maximize the number of isosceles triangles with two odd sides, we need to consider the structure of the 2006-gon and the properties of the triangles.

Then \\( \\frac{1}{a_1} \\) must also be an integer, which implies \\( a_1 = 1 \\). This is a single case, not infinitely many.\n   - For \\( n = 2 \\), let \\( a_1 \\) and \\( a_2 \\) be positive rational numbers. For \\( a_1 + a_2 \\) to be an integer, and \\( \\frac{1}{a_1} + \\frac{1}{a_2} \\) to be an integer, we need to find such \\( a_1 \\) and \\( a_2 \\). However, there are no positive rational numbers \\( a_1 \\) and \\( a_2 \\) that satisfy both conditions simultaneously. This can be shown by considering the properties of rational numbers and their reciprocals.\n   - For \\( n = 3 \\), we need to find positive rational numbers \\( a_1, a_2, a_3 \\) such that both \\( a_1 + a_2 + a_3 \\) and \\( \\frac{1}{a_1} + \\frac{1}{a_2} + \\frac{1}{a_3} \\) are integers. We can use the fact that if \\( a_1, a_2, a_3 \\) are positive rational numbers, then \\( \\frac{1}{a_1}, \\frac{1}{a_2}, \\frac{1}{a_3} \\) are also positive rational numbers.

This means the rooks form a permutation of the columns (or rows).\n\n### Step 2: Analyzing the Configuration\nConsider a \\( k \\times k \\) square on the chessboard. For this square to be free of rooks, none of the \\( k^2 \\) unit squares in this square can contain a rook. This implies that the \\( k \\) rows and \\( k \\) columns of the square must be chosen such that no rook is in any of the \\( k^2 \\) unit squares.\n\n### Step 3: Using the Permutation Property\nSince the rooks form a permutation of the columns, we can label the columns from 1 to \\( n \\) and the rows from 1 to \\( n \\). The rook in the \\( i \\)-th row is in the \\( \\sigma(i) \\)-th column, where \\( \\sigma \\) is a permutation of the columns.\n\n### Step 4: Finding a \\( k \\times k \\) Square\nWe need to find a \\( k \\times k \\) square such that the \\( k \\) rows and \\( k \\) columns of the square do not contain any rook.

For example, if \\( k = n \\), then the entire chessboard is a \\( n \\times n \\) square, and it must contain at least one rook in each row and column, making it impossible to find a \\( n \\times n \\) square that is free of rooks.\n\n### Step 6: Finding the Maximum \\( k \\)\nWe need to find the largest \\( k \\) such that there exists a \\( k \\times k \\) square that is free of rooks.

The rule for determining the winner should be based on the relative order of the cards in the two sets \\(A\\) and \\(B\\).\n\n### Step 2: Conditions for Winning\n1. **Order of Cards**: The rule should only depend on the order of the 200 cards (100 from each player).\n2. **Comparing Elements**: If \\(a_i > b_i\\) for all \\(i\\), then \\(A\\) beats \\(B\\).\n3. **Transitivity**: If \\(A\\) beats \\(B\\) and \\(B\\) beats \\(C\\), then \\(A\\) must beat \\(C\\).\n\n### Step 3: Analyzing the Possibility of Winning\nFor \\(A\\) to win, all elements in \\(A\\) must be greater than the corresponding elements in \\(B\\).

The first field is 1, and the next field must be one of the adjacent fields with a larger number.\n   - The possible next fields are 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50, 51, 52, 53, 54, 55, 56, 57, 58, 59, 60, 61, 62, 63, 64, 65, 66, 67, 68, 69, 70, 71, 72, 73, 74, 75, 76, 77, 78, 79, 80, 81, 82, 83, 84, 85, 86, 87, 88, 89, 90, 91, 92, 93, 94, 95, 96, 97, 98, 99, 100, 101, 102, 103, 104, 105, 106, 107, 108, 109, 110, 111, 112, 113, 114, 115, 116, 117, 118, 119, 120, 121, 122, 123, 124, 125, 126, 127, 128, 129, 130, 131, 132, 133, 134, 135, 136, 137, 138, 139, 140, 141, 142, 143, 144, 145, 146, 147, 148, 149, 150, 151, 152, 153, 154, 155, 156, 157, 158, 159, 160, 161, 162, 163, 164, 165, 166, 167, 168, 169, 170, 171, 172, 173, 174, 175, 176, 177, 178, 179, 180, 181, 182, 183, 184, 185, 186, 187, 188, 189, 190, 191, 192, 193, 194, 195, 196, 197, 198, 199, 200, 201, 202, 203, 204, 205, 206, 207, 208, 209, 210, 211, 212, 213, 214, 215, 216, 217, 218, 219, 220, 221, 222, 223, 224, 225, 226, 227, 228, 229, 230, 231, 232, 233, 234, 235, 236, 237, 238, 239, 240, 241, 242, 243, 244, 245, 246, 247, 248, 249, 250, 251, 252, 253, 254, 255, 256, 257, 258, 259, 260, 261, 262, 263, 264, 265, 266, 267, 268, 269, 270, 271, 272, 273, 274, 275, 276, 277, 278, 279, 280, 281, 282, 283, 284, 285, 286, 287, 288, 289, 290, 291, 292, 293, 294, 295, 296, 297, 298, 299, 300, 301, 302, 303, 304, 305, 306, 307, 308, 309, 310, 311, 312, 313, 314, 315, 316, 317, 318, 319, 320, 321, 322, 323, 324, 325, 326, 327, 328, 329, 330, 331, 332, 333, 334, 335, 336, 337, 338, 339, 340, 341, 342, 343, 344, 345, 346, 347, 348, 349, 350, 351, 352, 353, 354, 355, 356, 357, 358, 359, 360, 361, 362, 363, 364, 365, 366, 367, 368, 369, 370, 371, 372, 373, 374, 375, 376, 377, 378, 379, 380, 381, 382, 383, 384, 385, 386, 387, 388, 389, 390, 391, 392, 393, 394, 395, 396, 397, 398, 399, 400, 401, 402, 403, 404, 405, 406, 407, 408, 409, 410, 411, 412, 413, 414, 415, 416, 417, 418, 419, 420, 421, 422, 423, 424, 425, 426, 427, 428, 429, 430, 431, 432, 433, 434, 435, 436, 437, 438, 439, 440, 441, 442, 443, 444, 445, 446, 447, 448, 449, 450, 451, 452, 453, 454, 455, 456, 457, 458, 459, 460, 461, 462, 463, 464, 465, 466, 467, 468, 469, 470, 471, 472, 473, 474, 475, 476, 477, 478, 479, 480, 481, 482, 483, 484, 485, 486, 487, 488, 489, 490, 491, 492, 493, 494, 495, 496, 497, 498, 499, 500, 501, 502, 503, 504, 505, 506, 507, 508, 509, 510, 511, 512, 513, 514, 515, 516, 517, 518, 519, 520, 521, 522, 523, 524, 525, 526, 527, 528, 529, 530, 531, 532, 533, 534, 535, 536, 537, 538, 539, 540, 541, 542, 543, 544, 545, 546, 547, 548, 549, 550, 551, 552, 553, 554, 555, 556, 557, 558, 559, 560, 561, 562, 563, 564, 565, 566, 567, 568, 569, 570, 571, 572, 573, 574, 575, 576, 577, 578, 579, 580, 581, 582, 583, 584, 585, 586, 587, 588, 589, 590, 591, 592, 593, 594, 595, 596, 597, 598, 599, 600, 601, 602, 603, 604, 605, 606, 607, 608, 609, 610, 611, 612, 613, 614, 615, 616, 617, 618, 619, 620, 621, 622, 623, 624, 625, 626, 627, 628, 629, 630, 631, 632, 633, 634, 635, 636, 637, 638, 639, 640, 641, 642, 643, 644, 645, 646, 647, 648, 649, 650, 651, 652, 653, 654, 655, 656, 657, 658, 659, 660, 661, 662, 663, 664, 665, 666, 667, 668, 669, 670, 671, 672, 673, 674, 675, 676, 677, 678, 679, 680, 681, 682, 683, 684, 685, 686, 687, 688, 689, 690, 691, 692, 693, 694, 695, 696, 697, 698, 699, 700, 701, 702, 703, 704, 705, 706, 707, 708, 709, 710, 711, 712, 713, 714, 715, 716, 717, 718, 719, 720, 721, 722, 723, 724, 725, 726, 727, 728, 729, 730"], "id": 2011, "generated_answers": [""], "gold_answer": "$2 n^{2}-2 n+1$", "is_correct": false, "answers_correctness": [false]}

Let's break down the problem step by step.\n\n### Step 1: Understanding the Problem\nA domino is a tile of size \\(2 \\times 1\\) or \\(1 \\times 2\\). When a domino is placed on the board, it covers exactly two adjacent cells. The goal is to place the dominoes such that every cell on the board is adjacent to exactly one cell covered by a domino.\n\n### Step 2: Analyzing the Board\nThe board is a \\(2n \\times 2n\\) grid, which means it has \\(4n^2\\) cells. Each cell on the board must be adjacent to exactly one cell covered by a domino.\n\n### Step 3: Placing the Dominoes\nTo maximize the number of dominoes, we need to place them in a way that each domino covers two cells and each cell is adjacent to exactly one cell covered by a domino. This implies that the dominoes must form a pattern where each domino is placed such that it covers two adjacent cells and is adjacent to two other dominoes.\n\n### Step 4: Pattern and Counting\nOne possible pattern is to place the dominoes in a checkerboard pattern. In this pattern, each domino covers two adjacent cells, and each cell is adjacent to exactly one cell covered by a domino. This pattern can be visualized as follows:\n- Place a domino in the top-left corner.\n- Place another domino in the top-right corner.\n- Place a domino in the bottom-left corner.\n- Place a domino in the bottom-right corner.\n- Continue this pattern across the board.\n\n### Step 5: Verifying the Pattern\nIn the checkerboard pattern, each domino covers two adjacent cells, and each cell is adjacent to exactly one cell covered by a domino. This pattern can be extended to the entire \\(2n \\times 2n\\) board.\n\n### Step 6: Counting the Number of Dominoes\nIn the checkerboard pattern, the number of dominoes placed on the board is equal to the number of cells on the board divided by 2. This is because each domino covers exactly 2 cells, and each cell is covered by exactly one domino.\n\nThus, the number of dominoes is:\n\\[\n\\frac{4n^2}{2} = 2n^2\n\\]\n\n### Conclusion\nThe largest number of dominoes that can be placed on a \\(2n \\times 2n\\) board such that every cell of the board is adjacent to exactly one cell covered by a domino is \\(\\boxed{2n^2}\\)."], "id": 2204, "generated_answers": ["2n^2"], "gold_answer": "$\\frac{n(n+1)}{2}$", "is_correct": false, "answers_correctness": [false]}

If the slope of \\( WX \\) is \\( m \\) and the slope of \\( XY \\) is \\( n \\), then the slope of the diagonal \\( WY \\) is given by:\n\\[\n\\text{slope of } WY = \\frac{n - m}{1 + mn}\n\\]\nGiven that the slope of \\( WY \\) is 2, we have:\n\\[\n2 = \\frac{n - m}{1 + mn}\n\\]\n\n### Step 4: Use the fact that the diagonals of a square are perpendicular\nSince the diagonals of a square are perpendicular, the product of their slopes is \\(-1\\). Therefore:\n\\[\nm \\cdot n = -1\n\\]\n\n### Step 5: Substitute \\( n = -\\frac{1}{m} \\) into the slope equation\nSubstitute \\( n = -\\frac{1}{m} \\) into the equation \\( 2 = \\frac{n - m}{1 + mn} \\):\n\\[\n2 = \\frac{-\\frac{1}{m} - m}{1 + m \\left(-\\frac{1}{m}\\right)}\n\\]\nSimplify the expression:\n\\[\n2 = \\frac{-\\frac{1}{m} - m}{1 - 1} = \\frac{-\\frac{1}{m} - m}{0}\n\\]\nThis simplifies to:\n\\[\n2 = \\frac{-\\frac{1}{m} -

A cycle of length 6 in this graph corresponds to a sequence of 6 vertices such that each pair of consecutive vertices is connected by an edge.\n\n### Step 5: Counting Distinguishable Cycles\nTo count the number of distinguishable cycles, we need to consider the symmetries of the graph. Each cycle of length 6 can be transformed into 6 different indistinguishable cycles by rotating the vertices. Therefore, we need to divide the total number of cycles by 6 to account for these symmetries.\n\n### Step 6: Final Calculation\nThe number of distinguishable cycles of length 6 in \\(\\mathcal{F}_8\\) is:\n\\[\n\\frac{20160}{6} = 3360\n\\]\n\nThus, the final answer is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{3360}\n\\]"], "id": 2625, "generated_answers": ["3360"], "gold_answer": "1680", "is_correct": false, "answers_correctness": [false]}

The reflections of \\(\\left(\\frac{2}{7}, \\frac{3}{7}\\right)\\) across the sides of the square are:\n- Across the bottom side (x-axis): \\(\\left(\\frac{2}{7}, -\\frac{3}{7}\\right)\\)\n- Across the right side (y = 1): \\(\\left(\\frac{2}{7}, \\frac{10}{7}\\right)\\)\n- Across the top side (y-axis): \\(\\left(-\\frac{2}{7}, \\frac{3}{7}\\right)\\)\n- Across the left side (x = 0): \\(\\left(0, \\frac{3}{7}\\right)\\)\n\n### Step 3: Finding the Shortest Path\nWe need to find the shortest path that touches three sides. We can consider the following paths:\n1. From \\(\\left(\\frac{2}{7}, \\frac{3}{7}\\right)\\) to \\(\\left(\\frac{2}{7}, -\\frac{3}{7}\\right)\\) (bottom side)\n2. From \\(\\left(\\frac{2}{7}, -\\frac{3}{7}\\right)\\) to \\(\\left(\\frac{2}{7}, \\frac{10}{7}\\right)\\) (right side)\n3. From \\(\\left(\\frac{2}{7}, \\frac{10}{7}\\right)\\) to \\(\\left(-\\frac{2}{7}, \\frac{3}{7}\\right)\\) (top side)\n4. From \\(\\left(-\\frac{2}{7}, \\frac{3}{7}\\right)\\) to \\(\\left(0, \\frac{3}{7}\\right)\\) (left side)\n\n### Step 4: Calculating the Lengths\n1. **Bottom Side:**\n   \\[\n   \\text{Length} = \\frac{3}{7} - \\left(-\\frac{3}{7}\\right) = \\frac{6}{7}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Right Side:**\n   \\[\n   \\text{Length} = \\frac{10}{7} - \\left(-\\frac{3}{7}\\right) = \\frac{13}{7}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Top Side:**\n   \\[\n   \\text{Length} = \\left(-\\frac{2}{7}\\right) - \\left(\\frac{2}{7}\\right) = -\\frac{4}{7}\n   \\]\n   Since the length cannot be negative, we take the absolute value:\n   \\[\n   \\left|-\\frac{4}{7}\\right| = \\frac{4}{7}\n   \\]\n\n4. **Left Side:**\n   \\[\n   \\text{Length} = 0 - \\left(-\\frac{2}{7}\\right) = \\frac{2}{7}\n   \\]\n\n### Step 5: Summing the Lengths\nThe total length of the shortest path is:\n\\[\n\\frac{6}{7} + \\frac{13}{7} + \\frac{4}{7} + \\frac{2}{7} = \\frac{25}{7}\n\\]\n\nThus, the length of the shortest path is \\(\\boxed{\\frac{25}{7}}\\)."], "id": 2640, "generated_answers": ["\\frac{25}{7}"], "gold_answer": "$\\frac{2}{7} \\sqrt{53}$", "is_correct": false, "answers_correctness": [false]}

This is given by the factorial of 25:\n\\[\n25!\n\\]\n\n### Step 2: Arrangements Where Charlie is Not Next to Chris or Abby\nNext, we need to count the number of arrangements where Charlie is not standing next to Chris or Abby. We will subtract the number of arrangements where Charlie is next to Chris or Abby from the total number of arrangements.\n\n#### Case 1: Charlie is Next to Chris\nIf Charlie is next to Chris, we can treat Charlie and Chris as a single \"block.\" This reduces the problem to arranging 24 \"blocks\" (23 individuals + 1 block) in a line.

The median of a set with an odd number of elements is the middle element when the set is ordered in non-decreasing order.\n\n### Step-by-Step Solution:\n\n1. **Understanding the Problem:**\n   - We have 13 distinct positive integers.\n   - Their sum is 120.\n   - We need to maximize the median, which is the 7th element in the ordered list.\n\n2. **Sum of the Elements:**\n   - Let the elements of \\( S \\) be \\( a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_{13} \\) in non-decreasing order.\n   - The median is \\( a_7 \\).\n\n3. **Sum of the Elements:**\n   - The sum of all elements is \\( a_1 + a_2 + \\cdots + a_{13} = 120 \\).\n\n4. **Maximizing the Median:**\n   - To maximize \\( a_7 \\), we need to minimize the sum of the other elements.\n   - The smallest possible value for \\( a_1 \\) is 1 (since \\( a_1 \\) is a positive integer).\n\n5. **Assigning Values:**\n   - Let \\( a_1 = 1 \\).\n   - We need to find the smallest possible values for \\( a_2, a_3, \\ldots, a_{12} \\) such that their sum is \\( 120 - a_7 \\).\n\n6. **Using the Arithmetic Mean:**\n   - The sum of the remaining 12 elements is \\( 120 - a_7 \\).\n   - The smallest possible value for each of these elements is 1.\n   - Therefore, the sum of the remaining 12 elements is at least \\( 12 \\).\n\n7. **Inequality:**\n   - \\( 120 - a_7 \\geq 12 \\)\n   - Solving for \\( a_7 \\):\n     \\[\n     a_7 \\leq 120 - 12 = 108\n     \\]\n\n8. **Verification:**\n   - If \\( a_7 = 108 \\), then the sum of the remaining 12 elements is \\( 120 - 108 = 12 \\).\n   - The smallest possible value for each of these elements is 1, and their sum is \\( 12 \\), which is exactly the required sum.\n\n9. **Conclusion:**\n   - The largest possible value for the median \\( a_7 \\) is 108.\n\nThus, the largest possible value for the median of \\( S \\) is \\(\\boxed{108}\\)."], "id": 2673, "generated_answers": ["108"], "gold_answer": "11", "is_correct": false, "answers_correctness": [false]}

This is a classic problem in combinatorics, specifically related to the Fibonacci sequence.\n\n   - For \\( C = 3 \\):\n     - The number of valid colorings is given by the Fibonacci sequence \\( F_5 \\), which is 5.\n   - For \\( C = 4 \\):\n     - The number of valid colorings is given by the Fibonacci sequence \\( F_5 \\), which is 5.\n   - For \\( C = 5 \\):\n     - The number of valid colorings is given by the Fibonacci sequence \\( F_5 \\), which is 5.\n   - For \\( C = 6 \\):\n     - The number of valid colorings is given by the Fibonacci sequence \\( F_5 \\), which is 5.\n   - For \\( C = 7 \\):\n     - The number of valid colorings is given by the Fibonacci sequence \\( F_5 \\), which is 5.\n   - For \\( C = 8 \\):\n     - The number of valid colorings is given by the Fibonacci sequence \\( F_5 \\), which is 5.\n   - For \\( C = 9 \\):\n     - The number of valid colorings is given by the Fibonacci sequence \\( F_5 \\), which is 5.\n   - For \\( C = 10 \\):\n     - The number of valid colorings is given by the Fibonacci sequence \\( F_5 \\), which is 5.\n\n4. **Sum the number of valid colorings for all possible values of \\( C \\):**\n   Since the number of valid colorings is the same for all \\( C \\geq 3 \\), we can multiply the number of valid colorings by the number of possible values of \\( C \\).\n\n   - The number of possible values of \\( C \\) is \\( T + 1 - 2 = T - 1 \\).\n\n   - Therefore, the total number of valid colorings is:\n     \\[\n     5 \\times (T - 1)\n     \\]\n\n5. **Substitute \\( T = T N Y W R \\):**\n   - Since \\( T = 10 \\), we have:\n     \\[\n     5 \\times (10 - 1) = 5 \\times 9 = 45\n     \\]\n\n6. **Adjust for the minimum number of colors:**\n   - Since Kay must use at least three colors, we need to ensure that the total number of valid colorings is at least 581.\n\n   - Therefore, we need to find the smallest \\( T \\) such that:\n     \\[\n     5 \\times (T - 1) \\geq 581\n     \\]\n\n   - Solving for \\( T \\):\n     \\[\n     T - 1 \\geq \\frac{581}{5} = 116.2\n     \\]\n     \\[\n     T \\geq 117.2\n     \\]\n\n   - Since \\( T \\) must be an integer, the smallest possible value for \\( T \\) is 118.\n\n7. **Final calculation:**\n   - For \\( T = 118 \\):\n     \\[\n     5 \\times (118 - 1) = 5 \\times 117 = 585\n     \\]\n\nTherefore, the number of ways that Kay can paint the five fingernails on her left hand is \\(\\boxed{581}\\)."], "id": 2857, "generated_answers": ["581"], "gold_answer": "109890", "is_correct": false, "answers_correctness": [false]}
