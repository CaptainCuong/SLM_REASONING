The number of ways to choose \\(n\\) pairs from \\(2n\\) points is given by:\n\\[\n\\frac{(2n)!}{2^n \\cdot n!}\n\\]\nThis is because we can arrange \\(2n\\) points in \\((2n)!\\) ways, and then divide by \\(2^n\\) to account for the fact that each pair can be chosen in 2 ways (e.g., \\((A, B)\\) or \\((B, A)\\)), and by \\(n!\\) to account for the fact that the order of the pairs does not matter.\n\n### Step 4: Subtracting Invalid Configurations\nWe need to subtract the number of configurations that do not meet the conditions for a good configuration.

It can be written as \\(x = qab\\), where \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are in the first line.

Specifically, for each prime factor \\( p_i \\):\n- If \\( \\beta_i \\geq \\gamma_i \\), the exponent in \\( f(a) - f(b) \\) is \\( \\beta_i - \\gamma_i \\).\n- If \\( \\beta_i < \\gamma_i \\), the exponent in \\( f(a) - f(b) \\) is \\( \\gamma_i - \\beta_i \\).\n\n### Step 4: Count the number of prime factors greater than \\( 10^{100} \\)\nThe number of prime factors of \\( f(a) - f(b) \\) greater than \\( 10^{100} \\) is:\n\\[\n\\mho(f(a) - f(b)) = \\sum_{i: p_i > 10^{100}} (\\beta_i - \\gamma_i) \\quad \\text{if } \\beta_i \\geq \\gamma_i\n\\]\n\\[\n\\mho(f(a) - f(b)) = \\sum_{i: p_i > 10^{100}} (\\gamma_i - \\beta_i) \\quad \\text{if } \\beta_i < \\gamma_i\n\\]\n\n### Step 5: Relate to \\(\\mho(a - b)\\)\nThe number of prime factors of \\( a - b \\) greater than \\( 10^{100} \\) is:\n\\[\n\\mho(a - b) = \\sum_{i: p_i > 10^{100}} \\alpha_i\n\\]\n\n### Step 6: Compare the two sums\nFor the inequality \\(\\mho(f(a) - f(b)) \\leq \\mho(a - b)\\) to hold, the sum of the exponents of the prime factors of \\( f(a) - f(b) \\) must be less than or equal to the sum of the exponents of the prime factors of \\( a - b \\).\n\n### Step 7: Determine the form of \\( f \\)\nTo ensure the inequality holds for all \\( a \\) and \\( b \\), \\( f \\) must be such that the exponents in \\( f(a) - f(b) \\) are always less than or equal to the exponents in \\( a - b \\). This implies that \\( f \\) must be a linear function of the form \\( f(x) = x + c \\) or \\( f(x) = -x + c \\) for some constant \\( c \\).\n\n### Step 8: Verify the solution\nFor \\( f(x) = x + c \\):\n\\[\nf(a) - f(b) = (a + c) - (b + c) = a - b\n\\]\n\\[\n\\mho(f(a) - f(b)) = \\mho(a - b)\n\\]\n\nFor \\( f(x) = -x + c \\):\n\\[\nf(a) - f(b) = (-a + c) - (-b + c) = b - a\n\\]\n\\[\n\\mho(f(a) - f(b)) = \\mho(b - a) = \\mho(a - b)\n\\]\n\nBoth cases satisfy the inequality \\(\\mho(f(a) - f(b)) \\leq \\mho(a - b)\\).\n\n### Final Answer\nThe strictly increasing functions \\( f: \\mathbb{Z} \\rightarrow \\mathbb{Z} \\) that satisfy the given condition are:\n\\[\n\\boxed{f(x) = x + c \\text{ and } f(x) = -x + c \\text{ for any constant } c}\n\\]"], "id": 1965, "generated_answers": ["f(x) = x + c \\text{ and } f(x) = -x + c \\text{ for any constant } c"], "gold_answer": "$f(x)=a x+b$, where $b$ is an arbitrary integer, and $a$ is an arbitrary positive integer with $\\mho(a)=0$", "is_correct": false, "answers_correctness": [false]}

We need to find the largest \\( k \\) such that for any such configuration, there is a \\( k \\times k \\) square that does not contain any rooks.\n\n### Step 2: Analyzing the Configuration\nConsider a \\( k \\times k \\) square on the chessboard. The number of unit squares in this square is \\( k^2 \\). We need to ensure that none of these \\( k^2 \\) unit squares contain a rook.\n\n### Step 3: Counting the Rooks\nIn a happy configuration, there are \\( n \\) rooks, and each row and each column contains exactly one rook. Therefore, the number of rooks in the \\( k \\times k \\) square is \\( k \\) (since each row and each column in the square contains exactly one rook).\n\n### Step 4: Ensuring No Rooks in the Square\nTo ensure that the \\( k \\times k \\) square does not contain any rooks, the number of rooks in the square must be less than \\( k^2 \\).

value from 3 to \\(n\\).\n\n4. **Counting the Pairs:**\n   - The number of pairs \\((a, b)\\) such that \\(a + b = k\\) for a given \\(k\\) is \\(k - 1\\) if \\(k\\) is even and \\(k\\) if \\(k\\) is odd.\n   - This is because for even \\(k\\), \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) must be distinct and both must be less than \\(k\\), so there are \\(k - 1\\) choices for \\(a\\) and \\(b\\).\n   - For odd \\(k\\), \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) must be distinct and both must be less than \\(k\\), so there are \\(k\\) choices for \\(a\\) and \\(b\\).\n\n5. **Maximizing the Number of Pairs:**\n   - To maximize the number of pairs, we need to consider the distribution of even and odd sums.\n   - The sums from 3 to \\(n\\) will be a mix of even and odd numbers.\n   - The number of even sums is \\(\\left\\lfloor \\frac{n-1}{2} \\right\\rfloor\\) and the number of odd sums is \\(\\left\\lceil \\frac{n-1}{2} \\right\\rceil\\).\n\n6. **Calculating the Total Number of Pairs:**\n   - The total number of pairs is the sum of the number of pairs for each sum.\n   - For even sums: \\(\\sum_{k=2}^{\\left\\lfloor \\frac{n-1}{2} \\right\\rfloor} (2k-1) = \\left\\lfloor \\frac{n-1}{2} \\right\\rfloor^2\\).\n   - For odd sums: \\(\\sum_{k=1}^{\\left\\lceil \\frac{n-1}{2} \\right\\rceil} (2k-1) = \\left\\lceil \\frac{n-1}{2} \\right\\rceil^2\\).\n\n7. **Simplifying the Expression:**\n   - The total number of pairs is \\(\\left\\lfloor \\frac{n-1}{2} \\right\\rfloor^2 + \\left\\lceil \\frac{n-1}{2} \\right\\rceil^2\\).\n   - This can be simplified to \\(\\left\\lfloor \\frac{n-1}{2} \\right\\rfloor \\left\\lceil

Find the least $N$ that enables her to succeed.", "generated_responses": ["To solve this problem, we need to analyze the distribution and movement of coins by players \\( A \\) and \\( B \\) around a circle of 2012 boxes. Let's break down the problem step by step.\n\n### Step 1: Initial Distribution by Player \\( A \\)\nPlayer \\( A \\) starts by distributing \\( N \\) coins among the 2012 boxes such that each box gets at least one coin. This means:\n\\[ N \\geq 2012 \\]\n\n### Step 2: Moves by Player \\( B \\)\nPlayer \\( B \\) makes the first move by passing 1 coin from each box to an adjacent box. This move ensures that each box loses 1 coin and each adjacent box gains 1 coin. The number of coins in each box after the first move is:\n\\[ \\text{Box } i: \\text{Number of coins} = \\text{initial number of coins in box } i - 1 + 1 = \\text{initial number of coins in box } i \\]\n\n### Step 3: Moves by Player \\( A \\)\nPlayer \\( A \\) makes the second move by choosing several coins that were not involved in \\( B \\)'s previous move and are in different boxes.

This means that the number of coins in each box after \\( A \\)'s move must be at least 1.\n\n### Step 5: Analyzing the Distribution\nTo ensure that each box has at least 1 coin after every move, we need to consider the worst-case scenario where \\( B \\) makes the maximum possible number of moves without ensuring that any box has less than 1 coin.\n\n### Step 6: Calculating the Minimum \\( N \\)\nTo find the minimum \\( N \\) that ensures at least 1 coin in each box after every move, we need to consider the distribution of coins after each move. The key is to ensure that the number of coins in each box after \\( A \\)'s move is at least 1.\n\n### Step 7: Using the Pigeonhole Principle\nThe pigeonhole principle can be used to ensure that at least one box has at least 1 coin after each move. If we distribute \\( N \\) coins among 2012 boxes, the average number of coins per box is:\n\\[ \\frac{N}{2012} \\]\n\nTo ensure that at least one box has at least 1 coin, we need:\n\\[ \\frac{N}{2012} \\geq 1 \\]\n\\[ N \\geq 2012 \\]\n\nHowever, to ensure that at least 1 coin in each box after every move, we need to consider the distribution after each move.

That is, there exists a constant \\(k\\) such that:\n\\[\n(x, 4y) = k(3, 4).\n\\]\nThis gives us the system of equations:\n\\[\nx = 3k \\quad \\text{and} \\quad 4y = 4k \\implies y = k.\n\\]\nSubstituting \\(x = 3k\\) and \\(y = k\\) into the constraint \\(3x + 4y = 10\\), we get:\n\\[\n3(3k) + 4(k) = 10 \\implies 9k + 4k = 10 \\implies 13k = 10 \\implies k = \\frac{10}{13}.\n\\]\nThus, \\(x = 3k = 3 \\cdot \\frac{10}{13} = \\frac{30}{13}\\) and \\(y = k = \\frac{10}{13}\\).

Each face of the cube is a square of side length \\( n \\).\n   - When the cube is cut into \\( n^3 \\) smaller cubes, each face of the cube will be divided into \\( n^2 \\) smaller squares.\n   - Since three faces are painted, the total number of painted faces is \\( 3n^2 \\).\n\n3. **Counting the Painted Cubes:**\n   -

The diagonals of a square are equal in length and intersect at the center of the square. The diagonals also bisect each other at right angles.\n\n### Step 2: Place the Square in the Coordinate Plane\nLet's place the square \\( WXYZ \\) in the coordinate plane such that:\n- \\( W \\) is at \\((0, 0)\\)\n- \\( X \\) is at \\((a, 0)\\)\n- \\( Y \\) is at \\((a, a)\\)\n- \\( Z \\) is at \\((0, a)\\)\n\n### Step 3: Determine the Slope of the Diagonal \\( WY \\)\nThe diagonal \\( WY \\) passes through the points \\( W(0, 0) \\) and \\( Y(a, a) \\).

This suggests that the square is not aligned with the coordinate axes in the standard way.

The slope \\( m \\) of \\( WX \\) is:\n\\[\nm_{WX} = \\frac{0 - 0}{a - 0} = 0\n\\]\n\nThe line \\( XY \\) passes through \\( X(a, 0) \\) and \\( Y(a, a) \\).

The correct interpretation should be:\n\\[\nm_{WX} + m_{XY} = 0 + (-1) = -1\n\\]\n\nThus, the sum of the slopes of \\( WX \\) and \\( XY \\) is:\n\\boxed{-1}"], "id": 2583, "generated_answers": ["-1"], "gold_answer": "$-\\frac{8}{3}$", "is_correct": false, "answers_correctness": [false]}

A function \\( f \\) is tenuous if for all positive integers \\( x \\) and \\( y \\), the inequality \\( f(x) + f(y) > x^2 \\) holds.\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the tenuous condition\nFor \\( f \\) to be tenuous, we have:\n\\[ f(x) + f(y) > x^2 \\]\nfor all positive integers \\( x \\) and \\( y \\).

To do this, we will start by finding the minimum possible values for \\( g(1), g(2), \\ldots, g(20) \\) that satisfy the tenuous condition.\n\n### Step 3: Determine the minimum value of \\( g(1) \\)\nConsider \\( x = 1 \\):\n\\[ f(1) + f(y) > 1^2 = 1 \\]\nThis implies:\n\\[ f(1) > 1 - f(y) \\]\nSince \\( f(y) \\) must be an integer, the smallest possible value for \\( f(1) \\) is 1. However, to ensure \\( f \\) is tenuous, \\( f(1) \\) must be at least 1. Therefore, the minimum value for \\( g(1) \\) is 1.\n\n### Step 4: Determine the minimum value of \\( g(2) \\)\nConsider \\( x = 2 \\):\n\\[ f(2) + f(y) > 2^2 = 4 \\]\nThis implies:\n\\[ f(2) > 4 - f(y) \\]\nThe smallest possible value for \\( f(2) \\) is 4. Therefore, the minimum value for \\( g(2) \\) is 4.\n\n### Step 5: Generalize for \\( g(x) \\)\nFor a general \\( x \\), we have:\n\\[ f(x) + f(y) > x^2 \\]\nThis implies:\n\\[ f(x) > x^2 - f(y) \\]\nThe smallest possible value for \\( f(x) \\) is \\( \\left\\lceil \\frac{x^2}{2} \\right\\rceil \\).\n\n### Step 6: Calculate \\( g(14) \\)\nFor \\( x = 14 \\):\n\\[ g(14) \\geq \\left\\lceil \\frac{14^2}{2} \\right\\rceil = \\left\\lceil 98 \\right\\rceil = 98 \\]\n\nHowever, we need to ensure that the sum \\( g(1) + g(2) + \\cdots + g(20) \\) is minimized.

We will compare this with the sum when \\( g(14) = 98 \\).\n\n### Step 8: Calculate the sum for \\( g(14) = 136 \\)\nWe need to find the minimum values for \\( g(1), g(2), \\ldots, g(20) \\) such that the sum is minimized and \\( g(14) = 136 \\).\n\n### Step 9: Conclusion\nAfter calculating the minimum values for \\( g(1), g(2), \\ldots, g(20) \\) and ensuring the sum is minimized, we find that the minimum possible value for \\( g(14) \\) is indeed 136.\n\nThus, the minimum possible value for \\( g(14) \\) is \\(\\boxed{136}\\)."], "id": 2607, "generated_answers": ["136"], "gold_answer": "136", "is_correct": true, "answers_correctness": [true]}

For example:\n- \\( C(183) = C(10110111_2) = 3 \\) because there are three pairs of consecutive 1's: \\( (1,1) \\) in positions 1 and 2, positions 3 and 4, and positions 5 and 6.\n\n### Step 2: Analyzing the Binary Representation\nWe need to consider the binary representation of \\( n \\) for \\( n \\) from 1 to 256. Each number \\( n \\) can be represented as a sum of distinct powers of 2:\n\\[ n = 2^{a_1} + 2^{a_2} + \\cdots + 2^{a_k} \\]\nwhere \\( 0 \\leq a_1 < a_2 < \\cdots < a_k \\).\n\n### Step 3: Counting Consecutive 1's\nTo find \\( C(n) \\), we need to count the number of times a 1 appears in the binary representation of \\( n \\) and then determine how many of these 1's are consecutive.\n\n### Step 4: Using Generating Functions\nWe can use generating functions to count the number of consecutive 1's. The generating function for the number of consecutive 1's in the binary representation of \\( n \\) is:\n\\[ G(x) = \\frac{x}{1-x} + \\frac{x^2}{1-x^2} + \\frac{x^4}{1-x^4} + \\cdots \\]\n\n### Step 5: Coefficient Extraction\nThe coefficient of \\( x^n \\) in the expansion of \\( G(x) \\) gives \\( C(n) \\). We need to find the sum of the coefficients of \\( x^n \\) for \\( n \\) from 1 to 256.\n\n### Step 6: Simplifying the Problem\nWe can simplify the problem by considering the binary representation of \\( n \\) in terms of its bit positions. Each bit position \\( i \\) in the binary representation of \\( n \\) can be either 0 or 1. If the bit at position \\( i \\) is 1, it contributes to \\( C(n) \\) if the bit at position \\( i-1 \\) is also 1.\n\n### Step 7: Counting Valid Pairs\nWe need to count the number of valid pairs \\((i, i-1)\\) where both bits are 1. This is equivalent to counting the number of 1's in the binary representation of \\( n \\) and then subtracting the number of 1's that are not consecutive.\n\n### Step 8: Using Combinatorics\nThe number of ways to choose \\( k \\) positions out of \\( n \\) positions to be 1's is given by the binomial coefficient \\( \\binom{n}{k} \\). We need to sum this over all \\( k \\) from 1 to \\( n \\):\n\\[ \\sum_{k=1}^{n} \\binom{n}{k} \\]\n\n### Step 9: Summing the Series\nThe sum of the binomial coefficients for \\( n \\) from 1 to 256 is:\n\\[ \\sum_{n=1}^{256} \\sum_{k=1}^{n} \\binom{n}{k} \\]\n\n### Step 10: Final Calculation\nThe final calculation is:\n\\[ \\sum_{n=1}^{256} \\sum_{k=1}^{n} \\binom{n}{k} = 256 \\times 257 - 1 = 65792 - 1 = 65791 \\]\n\nHowever, we need to correct for the fact that we are counting each pair \\((i, i-1)\\) twice. The correct sum is:\n\\[ \\sum_{n=1}^{256} \\sum_{k=1}^{n} \\binom{n}{k} = 256 \\times 257 - 1 = 65792 - 1 = 65791 \\]\n\nThus, the final answer is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{256}\n\\]"], "id": 2672, "generated_answers": ["256"], "gold_answer": "448", "is_correct": false, "answers_correctness": [false]}

{"question": "In ARMLopolis, every house number is a positive integer, and City Hall's address is 0. However, due to the curved nature of the cowpaths that eventually became the streets of ARMLopolis, the distance $d(n)$ between house $n$ and City Hall is not simply the value of $n$. Instead, if $n=3^{k} n^{\\prime}$, where $k \\geq 0$ is an integer and $n^{\\prime}$ is an integer not divisible by 3 , then $d(n)=3^{-k}$. For example, $d(18)=1 / 9$ and $d(17)=1$. Notice that even though no houses have negative numbers, $d(n)$ is well-defined for negative values of $n$. For example, $d(-33)=1 / 3$ because $-33=3^{1} \\cdot-11$. By definition, $d(0)=0$. Following the dictum \"location, location, location,\" this Power Question will refer to \"houses\" and \"house numbers\" interchangeably.\n\nCuriously, the arrangement of the houses is such that the distance from house $n$ to house $m$, written $d(m, n)$, is simply $d(m-n)$. For example, $d(3,4)=d(-1)=1$ because $-1=3^{0} \\cdot-1$. In particular, if $m=n$, then $d(m, n)=0$.\n\n\nThe neighborhood of a house $n$, written $\\mathcal{N}(n)$, is the set of all houses that are the same distance from City Hall as $n$. In symbols, $\\mathcal{N}(n)=\\{m \\mid d(m)=d(n)\\}$. Geometrically, it may be helpful to think of $\\mathcal{N}(n)$ as a circle centered at City Hall with radius $d(n)$.\n\nLater, ARMLopolis finally decides on a drastic expansion plan: now house numbers will be rational numbers. To define $d(p / q)$, with $p$ and $q$ integers such that $p q \\neq 0$, write $p / q=3^{k} p^{\\prime} / q^{\\prime}$, where neither $p^{\\prime}$ nor $q^{\\prime}$ is divisible by 3 and $k$ is an integer (not necessarily positive); then $d(p / q)=3^{-k}$.\nCompute $d(3 / 5), d(5 / 8)$, and $d(7 / 18)$.", "generated_responses": ["To solve the problem, we need to compute the distances \\( d(3/5) \\), \\( d(5/8) \\), and \\( d(7/18) \\) using the given definition of the distance function \\( d \\).\n\n### Step 1: Compute \\( d(3/5) \\)\nFirst, we express \\( \\frac{3}{5} \\) in the form \\( \\frac{p}{q} = 3^k \\frac{p'}{q'} \\), where \\( p' \\) and \\( q' \\) are integers not divisible by 3.\n\n- The prime factorization of 5 is \\( 5 = 5 \\).\n- The prime factorization of 3 is \\( 3 = 3 \\).\n\nSince 5 and 3 are coprime, we can write:\n\\[ \\frac{3}{5} = 3^1 \\cdot \\frac{1}{5} \\]\n\nHere, \\( p' = 1 \\) and \\( q' = 5 \\), and \\( k = 1 \\).

{"question": "The mean, median, and unique mode of a list of positive integers are three consecutive integers in some order. Compute the least possible sum of the integers in the original list.", "generated_responses": ["To solve the problem, we need to find a list of positive integers where the mean, median, and unique mode are three consecutive integers in some order. Let's denote the list of integers as \\(a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n\\).\n\n### Step 1: Define the Mean, Median, and Mode\n- The mean \\(M\\) is given by:\n  \\[\n  M = \\frac{a_1 + a_2 + \\cdots + a_n}{n}\n  \\]\n- The median \\(M_e\\) is the middle value when the list is sorted in ascending order. If \\(n\\) is odd, the median is the \\(\\left(\\frac{n+1}{2}\\right)\\)-th element. If \\(n\\) is even, the median is the average of the \\(\\left(\\frac{n}{2}\\right)\\)-th and \\(\\left(\\frac{n}{2}+1\\right)\\)-th elements.\n- The mode \\(M_m\\) is the number that appears most frequently in the list.\n\n### Step 2: Set Up the Conditions\nGiven that the mean, median, and mode are three consecutive integers, we can write:\n\\[\nM = k, \\quad M_e = k+1, \\quad M_m = k+2\n\\]\nfor some integer \\(k\\).\n\n### Step 3: Analyze the List\n- The mode \\(M_m = k+2\\) must appear at least twice in the list.\n- The median \\(M_e = k+1\\) must be the middle value or the average of the two middle values.\n- The mean \\(M = k\\) must be the sum of the elements divided by the number of elements.\n\n### Step 4: Construct the List\nTo satisfy these conditions, the list must be constructed such that:\n- The number \\(k+2\\) appears at least twice.\n- The number \\(k+1\\) is the median.\n- The number \\(k\\) is the mean.\n\n### Step 5: Minimize the Sum\nTo minimize the sum of the integers, we should start with the smallest possible values for \\(k\\).\n\n#### Case 1: \\(k = 1\\)\n- Mean: \\(1\\)\n- Median: \\(2\\)\n- Mode: \\(3\\)\n\nThe list must be:\n\\[\n1,

list must be:\n\\[\n7, 8, 9, 8, 7\n\\]\n\nHowever, the mode \\(9\\) appears only twice, so this list does not satisfy the unique mode condition.\n\n#### Case 8: \\(k = 8\\)\n- Mean: \\(8\\)\n- Median: \\(9\\)\n- Mode: \\(10\\)\n\nThe list must be:\n\\[\n8, 9, 10, 9, 8\n\\]\n\nHowever, the mode \\(10\\) appears only twice, so this list does not satisfy the unique mode condition.\n\n#### Case 9: \\(k

The sum of the numbers at these points is 17. Since the numbers are positive integers, the minimum value for each number is 1. Therefore, the minimum sum of \\( n \\) numbers is \\( n \\).

The number of ways to choose 9 red diagonals is:\n     \\[\n     \\binom{10}{9} = 10\n     \\]\n\n   - ** Ten Red Diagonals:**\n     All 10 diagonals are red.

The number of ways to choose 3 faces out of 6 is given by the binomial coefficient:\n     \\[\n     \\binom{6}{3} = 20\n     \\]\n     Since there are 8 vertices, the total number of colorings where at least one vertex has three faces of the same color is:\n     \\[\n     8 \\times 20 = 160\n     \\]\n\n   - **Vertices with Four Faces of the Same Color:**\n     There are 8 vertices in a cube.

The number of ways to choose 5 faces out of 6 is given by the binomial coefficient:\n     \\[\n     \\binom{6}{5} = 6\n     \\]\n     Since there are 8 vertices, the total number of colorings where at least one vertex has five faces of the same color is:\n     \\[\n     8 \\times 6 = 48\n     \\]\n\n   - **Vertices with Six Faces of the Same Color:**\n     There are 8 vertices in a cube. For each vertex, we can choose 6 faces out of 6 to be the same color. The number of ways to choose 6 faces out of 6 is given by the binomial coefficient:\n     \\[\n     \\binom{6}{6} = 1\n     \\]\n     Since there are 8 vertices, the total number of colorings where at least one vertex has six faces of the same color is:\n     \\[\n     8 \\times 1 = 8\n     \\]\n\n4. **Applying Inclusion-Exclusion Principle:**\n   Using the principle of inclusion-exclusion, the number of colorings where at least one vertex has three faces of the same color is:\n   \\[\n   160 - 120 + 48 - 8 = 80\n   \\]\n\n5. **Valid Colorings:**\n   The number of valid colorings is the total number of colorings minus the number of invalid colorings:\n   \\[\n   64 - 80 = -16\n   \\]\n\n   This result is incorrect because we need to re-evaluate the inclusion-exclusion principle correctly.
