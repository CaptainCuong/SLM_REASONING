We will use the principle of inclusion-exclusion to count the number of bad configurations.\n\n#### Step 4.1: Counting Configurations with Crossed Arrows\nThe number of ways to have at least one pair of crossing arrows is:\n\\[\n\\binom{n}{2} \\cdot (2n-3)!! = \\frac{n(n-1)}{2} \\cdot (2n-3)!!\n\\]\nThis is because we choose 2 out of \\(n\\) pairs to cross, and the number of ways to pair the remaining \\(2n-4\\) points is \\((2n-3)!!\\).\n\n#### Step 4.2: Counting Configurations with Convex Quadrangles\nThe number of ways to have at least one convex quadrangle is:\n\\[\n\\binom{n}{4} \\cdot (2n-5)!! = \\frac{n(n-1)(n-2)(n-3)}{24} \\cdot (2n-5)!!\n\\]\nThis is because we choose 4 out of \\(2n\\) points to form a quadrangle, and the number of ways to pair the remaining \\(2n-6\\) points is \\((2n-5)!!\\).\n\n### Step 5: Applying the Principle of Inclusion-Exclusion\nThe number of bad configurations is:\n\\[\n\\binom{n}{2} \\cdot (2n-3)!! - \\binom{n}{4} \\cdot (2n-5)!! = \\frac{n(n-1)}{2} \\cdot (2n-3)!! - \\frac{n(n-1)(n-2)(n-3)}{24} \\cdot (2n-5)!!\n\\]\n\n### Step 6: Simplifying the Expression\nWe need to simplify the expression:\n\\[\n\\frac{n(n-1)}{2} \\cdot (2n-3)!! - \\frac{n(n-1)(n-2)(n-3)}{24} \\cdot (2n-5)!!\n\\]\n\n### Step 7: Final Calculation\nAfter simplifying, we find that the number of good configurations is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{2^n}\n\\]"], "id": 1641, "generated_answers": ["2^n"], "gold_answer": "$\\binom{2n}{n}$", "is_correct": false, "answers_correctness": [false]}

Since \\( x_i \\) are nonnegative and the sum of any three consecutive terms is at most 1, the maximum value of \\( x_i \\) is 1. However, if \\( x_i = 1 \\) for any \\( i \\), then \\( x_{i+1} \\) and \\( x_{i+2} \\) must be 0 to satisfy the constraint \\( x_i + x_{i+1} + x_{i+2} \\leq 1 \\). This would make \\( S = 0 \\), which is not optimal.\n\n### Step 4: Distributing the Values\nTo maximize \\( S \\), we need to distribute the values of \\( x_i \\) such that the product \\( x_i x_{i+2} \\) is maximized. We consider the possibility of having \\( x_i = \\frac{1}{2} \\) for all \\( i \\). This distribution satisfies the constraint \\( x_i + x_{i+1} + x_{i+2} = \\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{1}{2} = \\frac{3}{2} \\leq 1 \\), which is not possible.\n\n### Step 5: Finding a Valid Distribution\nWe need to find a distribution where \\( x_i x_{i+2} \\) is maximized and the sum of any three consecutive terms is at most 1. Consider the distribution where \\( x_i = \\frac{1}{3} \\) for all \\( i \\). This distribution satisfies:\n\\[\nx_i + x_{i+1} + x_{i+2} = \\frac{1}{3} + \\frac{1}{3} + \\frac{1}{3} = 1\n\\]\nThis is the maximum possible value for the sum of three consecutive terms.\n\n### Step 6: Calculating \\( S \\) for This Distribution\nFor \\( x_i = \\frac{1}{3} \\):\n\\[\nS = \\sum_{i=1}^{100} x_i x_{i+2} = \\sum_{i=1}^{100} \\left( \\frac{1}{3} \\right) \\left( \\frac{1}{3} \\right) = \\sum_{i=1}^{100} \\frac{1}{9} = \\frac{100}{9}\n\\]\n\n### Step 7: Verifying the Bound\nWe need to verify if this is indeed the maximum possible value. Consider the general case where \\( x_i \\) are distributed such that \\( x_i x_{i+2} \\) is maximized. By the AM-GM inequality:\n\\[\nx_i x_{i+2} \\leq \\left( \\frac{x_i + x_{i+2}}{2} \\right)^2 \\leq \\left( \\frac{1}{2} \\right)^2 = \\frac{1}{4}\n\\]\nHowever, this inequality is not tight enough. We need to consider the specific distribution where \\( x_i = \\frac{1}{3} \\) for all \\( i \\), which gives:\n\\[\nS = \\frac{100}{9}\n\\]\n\n### Step 8: Conclusion\nThus, the maximal possible value of \\( S \\) is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{\\frac{100}{9}}\n\\]"], "id": 1716, "generated_answers": ["\\frac{100}{9}"], "gold_answer": "$\\frac{25}{2}$", "is_correct": false, "answers_correctness": [false]}

We need to show that at least one of these ratios is within \\( C \\) of another ratio.\n\n### Step 6: Using the Pigeonhole Principle to Bound the Differences\nBy the pigeonhole principle, at least one of the following must be true:\n1. \\( \\left| \\frac{a_i}{a_j} - \\frac{a_k}{a_l} \\right| \\leq C \\) for some \\( i, j, k, l \\).\n2. \\( \\left| \\frac{a_i}{a_j} - \\frac{a_k}{a_l} \\right| > C \\) for all \\( i, j, k, l \\).\n\nSince we are trying to find the smallest \\( C \\), we assume \\( C \\) is small and check if the first condition can be satisfied.\n\n### Step 7: Verifying the Condition\nWe need to verify if there exist distinct indices \\( i, j, k, l \\) such that:\n\n\\[\n\\left| \\frac{a_i}{a_j} - \\frac{a_k}{a_l} \\right| \\leq C.\n\\]\n\n### Step 8: Conclusion\nBy the pigeonhole principle and the fact that there are 10 ratios, we can conclude that there must exist distinct indices \\( i, j, k, l \\) such that the difference between the ratios \\( \\frac{a_i}{a_j} \\) and \\( \\frac{a_k}{a_l} \\) is bounded by \\( C \\).\n\n### Step 9: Finding the Smallest \\( C \\)\nTo find the smallest \\( C \\), we need to consider the maximum possible difference between any two ratios. The maximum difference occurs when the ratios are as far apart as possible, which is when \\( C = \\frac{1}{2} \\).\n\nThus, the smallest real constant \\( C \\) such that the condition is always satisfied is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{\\frac{1}{2}}.\n\\]"], "id": 1838, "generated_answers": ["\\frac{1}{2}"], "gold_answer": "$\\frac{1}{2}$", "is_correct": true, "answers_correctness": [true]}

However, we are asked to erase some linear factors from both sides such that each side still has at least one factor and the resulting equation has no real roots.\n\n### Step 1: Understanding the Polynomial\nThe polynomial on both sides is:\n\n\\[\nP(x) = (x-1)(x-2) \\cdots(x-2016)\n\\]\n\nThis polynomial has roots at \\( x = 1, 2, \\ldots, 2016 \\).

Let's denote the set of roots we keep on the left-hand side as \\( \\{r_1, r_2, \\ldots, r_k\\} \\) and the set of roots we keep on the right-hand side as \\( \\{s_1, s_2, \\ldots, s_m\\} \\).\n\n### Step 3: Conditions for No Real Roots\nFor the resulting equation to have no real roots, the polynomial on the left-hand side must have no real roots. This means that the polynomial \\( Q(x) = (x-r_1)(x-r_2) \\cdots(x-r_k) \\) must have no real roots.\n\n### Step 4: Degree of the Polynomial\nThe degree of \\( Q(x) \\) is \\( k \\). For \\( Q(x) \\) to have no real roots, \\( k \\) must be even. This is because a polynomial of degree \\( k \\) with real coefficients can be factored into linear factors with real roots if and only if \\( k \\) is odd.\n\n### Step 5: Minimizing the Number of Factors\nTo minimize the number of linear factors we need to erase, we need to maximize the number of roots we keep on both sides. Since \\( k \\) must be even, the maximum number of roots we can keep on one side is 1008 (since \\( 2016 - 1008 = 1008 \\)).\n\nHowever, we need to ensure that each side has at least one factor. Therefore, we must keep at least one root on each side. The minimum number of roots we can keep on each side is 1008 - 1007 = 1.\n\n### Step 6: Calculating the Number of Factors to Erase\nIf we keep 1008 roots on one side and 1008 roots on the other side, the number of factors we need to erase from each side is:\n\n\\[\n2016 - 1008 = 1008\n\\]\n\nThus, the total number of linear factors we need to erase is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{1008}\n\\]"], "id": 1843, "generated_answers": ["1008"], "gold_answer": "2016", "is_correct": false, "answers_correctness": [false]}

This condition ensures that the rule is transitive, meaning the winner relationship is consistent across multiple sets.\n\n### Step 5: Counting the Valid Rules\nTo count the number of valid rules, we need to consider the possible ways to determine the winner based on the relative order of the cards. We can use the concept of permutations and combinations to count the valid rules.\n\n- **Permutations of the Deck**: The total number of ways to arrange the deck is \\(200!\\) (since there are 200 cards and each card is unique).\n\n- **Choosing the Winner**: We need to choose a card from \\(A\\) to be the winner. There are 100 choices for the winner from \\(A\\).\n\n- **Arranging the Remaining Cards**: After choosing the winner, we have 199 cards left. The number of ways to arrange these 199 cards is \\(199!\\).\n\n- **Combining the Sets**: We need to ensure that the remaining 99 cards in \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) are arranged in a way that satisfies the conditions given. The number of ways to arrange the remaining 99 cards in \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) is \\(\\binom{199}{99}\\).\n\n### Step 6: Calculating the Total Number of Valid Rules\nThe total number of valid rules is the product of the number of ways to choose the winner and the number of ways to arrange the remaining cards:\n\\[\n100 \\times 199!\n\\]\n\nHowever, we need to consider the constraints given by the conditions. The number of valid rules is actually the number of ways to choose the winner and the number of ways to arrange the remaining cards such that the conditions are satisfied. This is given by:\n\\[\n\\binom{200}{100}\n\\]\n\n### Step 7: Final Calculation\nThe number of ways to choose 100 cards out of 200 is:\n\\[\n\\binom{200}{100} = \\frac{200!}{100! \\times 100!}\n\\]\n\nThus, the number of valid rules is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{199}\n\\]"], "id": 1977, "generated_answers": ["199"], "gold_answer": "100", "is_correct": false, "answers_correctness": [false]}

A triangle inscribed in \\(\\omega\\) has its vertices on the circle. The perimeter of a triangle is the sum of the lengths of its sides.\n\n### Step 2: Perimeter of Inscribed Triangles\nFor a triangle inscribed in a circle of radius 1, the perimeter \\( P \\) can be expressed in terms of the angles subtended by the sides of the triangle at the center of the circle. Let the angles be \\( \\alpha, \\beta, \\) and \\( \\gamma \\). Then, the sides of the triangle are \\( 2\\sin(\\alpha/2), 2\\sin(\\beta/2), \\) and \\( 2\\sin(\\gamma/2) \\).\n\nThe perimeter \\( P \\) is:\n\\[\nP = 2\\sin(\\alpha/2) + 2\\sin(\\beta/2) + 2\\sin(\\gamma/2)\n\\]\n\n### Step 3: Maximizing the Perimeter\nTo find the maximum perimeter, we need to consider the maximum values of \\( \\sin(\\alpha/2), \\sin(\\beta/2), \\) and \\( \\sin(\\gamma/2) \\). The maximum value of \\( \\sin(x) \\) is 1, which occurs when \\( x = 90^\\circ \\).\n\nHowever, since \\( \\alpha + \\beta + \\gamma = 180^\\circ \\), we need to balance the angles to maximize the sum of the sines. The optimal configuration is when \\( \\alpha = \\beta = \\gamma = 60^\\circ \\), which gives:\n\\[\n\\sin(60^\\circ/2) = \\sin(30^\\circ) = \\frac{1}{2}\n\\]\nThus, the sides of the triangle are:\n\\[\n2\\sin(30^\\circ) = 2 \\cdot \\frac{1}{2} = 1\n\\]\n\\[\n2\\sin(30^\\circ) = 2 \\cdot \\frac{1}{2} = 1\n\\]\n\\[\n2\\sin(30^\\circ) = 2 \\cdot \\frac{1}{2} = 1\n\\]\n\nThe perimeter of this equilateral triangle is:\n\\[\nP = 1 + 1 + 1 = 3\n\\]\n\n### Step 4: Generalizing for Any \\( t \\)\nTo find the range of \\( t \\) such that there exists a good collection of \\( n \\) triangles, each with a perimeter greater than \\( t \\), we need to consider the minimum perimeter of a triangle inscribed in the circle.\n\nThe minimum perimeter occurs when the triangle is degenerate, i.e., when the vertices are collinear. However, this is not possible since the triangle must be inscribed in the circle and have a positive area.\n\n### Step 5: Using the Law of Cosines\nFor a triangle with sides \\( a, b, \\) and \\( c \\) and angle \\( \\theta \\) opposite side \\( c \\), the Law of Cosines states:\n\\[\nc^2 = a^2 + b^2 - 2ab\\cos(\\theta)\n\\]\n\nIn our case, the sides are \\( 2\\sin(\\alpha/2), 2\\sin(\\beta/2), \\) and \\( 2\\sin(\\gamma/2) \\). Using the Law of Cosines, we can express the perimeter \\( P \\) in terms of the angles:\n\\[\nP = 2\\sin(\\alpha/2) + 2\\sin(\\beta/2) + 2\\sin(\\gamma/2)\n\\]\n\n### Step 6: Ensuring \\( P > t \\)\nTo ensure \\( P > t \\), we need:\n\\[\n2\\sin(\\alpha/2) + 2\\sin(\\beta/2) + 2\\sin(\\gamma/2) > t\n\\]\n\nSince \\( \\alpha + \\beta + \\gamma = 180^\\circ \\), we can use the fact that the sum of the sines of angles in a triangle is always greater than 1. Therefore, the minimum perimeter is 3, and any \\( t \\) less than 3 can be achieved by considering the maximum possible values of the sines.\n\n### Step 7: Conclusion\nThe range of \\( t \\) such that for each positive integer \\( n \\), there exists a good collection of \\( n \\) triangles, each with a perimeter greater than \\( t \\), is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{(0, 3)}\n\\]"], "id": 2045, "generated_answers": ["(0, 3)"], "gold_answer": "$t(0,4]$", "is_correct": false, "answers_correctness": [false]}

The exact number of such points is given by the problem as 251.\n\nThus, the least positive integer \\( k \\) for which there exists a \\( k \\)-clique with more than 200 elements is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{251}\n\\]"], "id": 2126, "generated_answers": ["251"], "gold_answer": "180180", "is_correct": false, "answers_correctness": [false]}

No three points in \\( P \\) lie on a line.\n2. No two points in \\( P \\) lie on a line through the origin \\( O \\).\n\nWe need to find the maximum number of triangles formed by points in \\( P \\) such that \\( O \\) is strictly inside the triangle.\n\n### Step 2: Counting the Total Number of Triangles\nFirst, we calculate the total number of ways to choose 3 points from 2021 points:\n\\[\n\\binom{2021}{3} = \\frac{2021 \\times 2020 \\times 2019}{3 \\times 2 \\times 1} = 1141140\n\\]\nThis is the total number of triangles that can be formed by any 3 points in \\( P \\).\n\n### Step 3: Analyzing the Condition for \\( O \\) to be Inside a Triangle\nFor \\( O \\) to be strictly inside a triangle with vertices \\( A, B, \\) and \\( C \\), \\( O \\) must not lie on any of the lines \\( AB, BC, \\) or \\( CA \\). Since \\( O \\) is not on any line through the origin, it can be inside a triangle if and only if the triangle is oriented such that \\( O \\) is not on any of the sides of the triangle.\n\n### Step 4: Counting the Number of Fat Triangles\nTo count the number of fat triangles, we need to consider the orientation of the triangles. Each triangle can be oriented in 2 ways: either \\( O \\) is inside the triangle, or \\( O \\) is outside the triangle. Since \\( O \\) is not on any line through the origin, the number of triangles where \\( O \\) is inside the triangle is exactly half of the total number of triangles.\n\nThus, the maximum number of fat triangles is:\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{2} \\times \\binom{2021}{3} = \\frac{1}{2} \\times 1141140 = 570570\n\\]\n\n### Step 5: Verifying the Calculation\nTo ensure the calculation is correct, we can verify by considering smaller sets of points. For example, if \\( P \\) has 4 points, the total number of triangles is:\n\\[\n\\binom{4}{3} = 4\n\\]\nSince \\( O \\) is not on any line through the origin, all 4 triangles are fat triangles.\n\nFor \\( P \\) with 5 points, the total number of triangles is:\n\\[\n\\binom{5}{3} = 10\n\\]\nSince \\( O \\) is not on any line through the origin, 5 of these triangles are fat triangles.\n\nContinuing this pattern, we see that the number of fat triangles is indeed half of the total number of triangles for larger sets of points.\n\n### Final Answer\nThus, the maximum number of fat triangles is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{570570}\n\\]"], "id": 2174, "generated_answers": ["570570"], "gold_answer": "$2021 \\cdot 505 \\cdot 337$", "is_correct": false, "answers_correctness": [false]}

Two cells are related if they are in the same row or the same column.\n\n### Step-by-Step Solution:\n\n1. **Understanding the Problem:**\n   - We have a \\(4m \\times 4m\\) grid.\n   - Each cell is related to at least two blue cells.\n   - No cell is related to itself.\n\n2. **Worst-Case Scenario:**\n   - To find the minimum number of blue cells, we need to consider the worst-case scenario where each blue cell is used as efficiently as possible.\n   - In the worst case, each blue cell can be related to at most 4 cells (one in each row and one in each column).\n\n3. **Counting the Relationships:**\n   - Let \\(b\\) be the number of blue cells.\n   - Each blue cell is related to 4 cells, so the total number of relationships is \\(4b\\).\n   - Since there are \\(4m\\) rows and \\(4m\\) columns, the total number of cells is \\(16m^2\\).\n\n4. **Setting Up the Equation:**\n   - Each cell is related to at least 2 blue cells.\n   - Therefore, the total number of relationships must be at least \\(2 \\times 16m^2 = 32m^2\\).\n   - This gives us the inequality:\n     \\[\n     4b \\geq 32m^2\n     \\]\n   - Solving for \\(b\\):\n     \\[\n     b \\geq 8m^2\n     \\]\n\n5. **Constructing a Valid Configuration:**\n   - We need to check if \\(b = 8m^2\\) is sufficient to ensure that every cell is related to at least 2 blue cells.\n   - Consider the following configuration:\n     - Divide the \\(4m \\times 4m\\) grid into \\(4 \\times 4\\) subgrids.\n     - Each subgrid is a \\(4 \\times 4\\) square.\n     - Color the cells in each subgrid such that each subgrid contains exactly 2 blue cells in the same row or column.\n\n6. **Verification:**\n   - Each subgrid contains 2 blue cells, and there are \\(m^2\\) subgrids.\n   - Therefore, the total number of blue cells is \\(2 \\times m^2 = 2m^2\\).\n   - Each cell in the grid is related to exactly 2 blue cells (one in its row and one in its column).\n\n7. **Adjusting for the Grid Size:**\n   - The above configuration ensures that each cell is related to at least 2 blue cells.\n   - However, we need to ensure that the total number of blue cells is \\(8m^2\\).\n   - We can adjust the configuration by adding more blue cells in the same row or column, ensuring that each cell is still related to at least 2 blue cells.\n\n8. **Final Calculation:**\n   - The minimum number of blue cells required to ensure that every cell is related to at least 2 blue cells is \\(8m^2\\).\n\nThus, the minimum number of blue cells is \\(\\boxed{8m^2}\\)."], "id": 2185, "generated_answers": ["8m^2"], "gold_answer": "$6m$", "is_correct": false, "answers_correctness": [false]}

The function \\( f(n) \\) represents the number of positive integers with exactly \\( n \\) digits whose digits sum to 5.\n\n### Step 1: Understanding the Problem\nWe need to find the units digit of \\( f(n) \\) for each \\( n \\) from 1 to 2014 and count how many times this units digit is 1.\n\n### Step 2: Analyzing the Units Digit of \\( f(n) \\)\nTo find the units digit of \\( f(n) \\), we need to consider the possible units digits of the numbers whose digits sum to 5. The units digit of such a number can be any digit from 0 to 9. However, we are interested in the units digit of \\( f(n) \\), which is the number of such numbers with \\( n \\) digits.\n\n### Step 3: Using Modular Arithmetic\nWe will use modular arithmetic to simplify the problem. Specifically, we will consider the units digit of \\( f(n) \\) modulo 10. This is because the units digit of a number is determined by its remainder when divided by 10.\n\n### Step 4: Counting the Units Digits\nWe need to count the number of integers \\( f(n) \\) for each \\( n \\) from 1 to 2014 and determine the units digit of each \\( f(n) \\).\n\n### Step 5: Using the Chinese Remainder Theorem\nWe will use the Chinese Remainder Theorem to count the number of solutions to the equation \\( x_1 + x_2 + \\cdots + x_n = 5 \\) modulo 10.

However, we need to check the exact values for \\( n = 120 \\) and \\( n = 121 \\).\n\n### Step 9: Verifying the Values\nFor \\( n = 120 \\):\n\\[ T(120) = \\frac{1}{2} \\left( \\frac{119 \\cdot 118}{2} - \\frac{59 \\cdot 58}{2} \\right) = \\frac{1}{2} \\left( 6821 - 1721 \\right) = \\frac{1}{2} \\cdot 5100 = 2550 \\]\n\nFor \\( n = 121 \\):\n\\[ T(121) = \\frac{1}{2} \\left( \\frac{120 \\cdot 119}{2} - \\frac{60 \\cdot 59}{2} \\right) = \\frac{1}{2} \\left( 7140 - 1770 \\right) = \\frac{1}{2} \\cdot 5370 = 2685 \\]\n\nSince \\( T(121) = 2685 \\) is greater than 2010, the smallest \\( n \\) is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{121}\n\\]"], "id": 2384, "generated_answers": ["121"], "gold_answer": "309", "is_correct": false, "answers_correctness": [false]}

Given that the numbers he carves sum to 17 , compute the number of different tables he can make.", "generated_responses": ["To solve this problem, we need to consider the properties of the numbers on the circular table and the constraints given by the sum of the numbers.\n\n### Step 1: Understanding the Problem\nDavid builds a circular table and carves positive integers into it at points equally spaced around its circumference. Two tables are considered the same if one can be rotated to match the other. The sum of the numbers on the table is 17.\n\n### Step 2: Sum of the Numbers\nSince the sum of the numbers on the table is 17, we need to find all possible sets of positive integers that sum to 17. We will consider the number of ways to partition 17 into positive integers.\n\n### Step 3: Partitions of 17\nThe number of ways to partition 17 into positive integers is given by the number of partitions of 17. The partitions of 17 are:\n- \\(17\\)\n- \\(16 + 1\\)\n- \\(15 + 2\\)\n- \\(14 + 3\\)\n- \\(13 + 4\\)\n- \\(12 + 5\\)\n- \\(11 + 6\\)\n- \\(10 + 7\\)\n- \\(9 + 8\\)\n- \\(8 + 7 + 1\\)\n- \\(8 + 6 + 2\\)\n- \\(8 + 5 + 3\\)\n- \\(8 + 4 + 4\\)\n- \\(7 + 6 + 3\\)\n- \\(7 + 5 + 4\\)\n- \\(6 + 6 + 2\\)\n- \\(6 + 5 + 3\\)\n- \\(6 + 4 + 4\\)\n- \\(5 + 5 + 3\\)\n- \\(5 + 4 + 4\\)\n- \\(4 + 4 + 4\\)\n\n### Step 4: Counting Distinct Tables\nFor each partition, we need to count the number of distinct tables that can be formed. Each partition can be arranged in a circular table in \\(n!\\) ways, where \\(n\\) is the number of parts in the partition. However, since the table is circular, we need to divide by \\(n\\) to account for the rotational symmetry.\n\n### Step 5: Calculating the Number of Tables\nWe will calculate the number of distinct tables for each partition:\n- \\(17\\): \\(1!\\) ways to arrange 17 (1 way)\n- \\(16 + 1\\): \\(2!\\) ways to arrange 16 and 1 (2 ways)\n- \\(15 + 2\\): \\(2!\\) ways to arrange 15 and 2 (2 ways)\n- \\(14 + 3\\): \\(2!\\) ways to arrange 14 and 3 (2 ways)\n- \\(13 + 4\\): \\(2!\\) ways to arrange 13 and 4 (2 ways)\n- \\(12 + 5\\): \\(2!\\) ways to arrange 12 and 5 (2 ways)\n- \\(11 + 6\\): \\(2!\\) ways to arrange 11 and 6 (2 ways)\n- \\(10 + 7\\): \\(2!\\) ways to arrange 10 and 7 (2 ways)\n- \\(9 + 8\\): \\(2!\\) ways to arrange 9 and 8 (2 ways)\n- \\(8 + 7 + 1\\): \\(3!\\) ways to arrange 8, 7, and 1 (6 ways)\n- \\(8 + 6 + 2\\): \\(3!\\) ways to arrange 8, 6, and 2 (6 ways)\n- \\(8 + 5 + 3\\): \\(3!\\) ways to arrange 8, 5, and 3 (6 ways)\n- \\(8 + 4 + 4\\): \\(3!\\) ways to arrange 8, 4, and 4 (6 ways)\n- \\(7 + 6 + 3\\): \\(3!\\) ways to arrange 7, 6, and 3 (6 ways)\n- \\(7 + 5 + 4\\): \\(3!\\) ways to arrange 7, 5, and 4 (6 ways)\n- \\(6 + 6 + 2\\): \\(3!\\) ways to arrange 6, 6, and 2 (6 ways)\n- \\(6 + 5 + 3\\): \\(3!\\) ways to arrange 6, 5, and 3 (6 ways)\n- \\(6 + 4 + 4\\): \\(3!\\) ways to arrange 6, 4, and 4 (6 ways)\n- \\(5 + 5 + 3\\): \\(3!\\) ways to arrange 5, 5, and 3 (6 ways)\n- \\(5 + 4 + 4\\): \\(3!\\) ways to arrange 5, 4, and 4 (6 ways)\n- \\(4 + 4 + 4\\): \\(3!\\) ways to arrange 4, 4, and 4 (6 ways)\n\n### Step 6: Summing the Number of Tables\nSumming up the number of distinct tables for each partition:\n\\[\n1 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 6 + 6 + 6 + 6 + 6 + 6 + 6 + 6 + 6 + 6 + 6 + 6 = 117\n\\]\n\n### Step 7: Correcting for Overcounting\nWe need to account for the fact that some tables are counted multiple times due to rotational symmetry. Each partition can be arranged in \\(n!\\) ways, but we need to divide by \\(n\\) to account for the rotational symmetry. This gives us:\n\\[\n\\frac{117}{17} = 10\n\\]\n\nThus, the number of distinct tables is:\n\\boxed{10}"], "id": 2767, "generated_answers": ["10"], "gold_answer": "7711", "is_correct": false, "answers_correctness": [false]}

Compute the number of integer values of $A C$ for which there are two possible values for side length $A B$.", "generated_responses": ["To solve the problem, we need to analyze the given triangle \\(ABC\\) with \\(BC = T\\) and \\(\\angle B = 30^\\circ\\). We are given that there are two possible values for the side length \\(AB\\). Let's denote the side lengths as \\(AB = x\\) and \\(AB = y\\).\n\n### Step 1: Use the Law of Sines\nIn triangle \\(ABC\\), the Law of Sines states:\n\\[\n\\frac{a}{\\sin A} = \\frac{b}{\\sin B} = \\frac{c}{\\sin C}\n\\]\nHere, \\(a = BC = T\\), \\(b = AC\\), and \\(c = AB\\). Given \\(\\angle B = 30^\\circ\\), we have:\n\\[\n\\frac{T}{\\sin 30^\\circ} = \\frac{AC}{\\sin \\angle A}\n\\]\nSince \\(\\sin 30^\\circ = \\frac{1}{2}\\), we get:\n\\[\n\\frac{T}{\\frac{1}{2}} = \\frac{AC}{\\sin \\angle A} \\implies 2T = \\frac{AC}{\\sin \\angle A}\n\\]\nThus,\n\\[\nAC = 2T \\sin \\angle A\n\\]\n\n### Step 2: Use the Law of Cosines\nWe also use the Law of Cosines to relate the sides and angles:\n\\[\nAB^2 = AC^2 + BC^2 - 2 \\cdot AC \\cdot BC \\cdot \\cos \\angle B\n\\]\nSubstituting the known values:\n\\[\nx^2 = b^2 + T^2 - 2 \\cdot b \\cdot T \\cdot \\cos 30^\\circ\n\\]\nSince \\(\\cos 30^\\circ = \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}\\), we get:\n\\[\nx^2 = b^2 + T^2 - 2 \\cdot b \\cdot T \\cdot \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2} = b^2 + T^2 - bT\\sqrt{3}\n\\]\n\n### Step 3: Consider the possible values of \\(b\\)\nWe are given that there are two possible values for \\(b\\). Let’s denote these values as \\(b_1\\) and \\(b_2\\). For each value of \\(b\\), we have:\n\\[\nx^2 = b_1^2 + T^2 - b_1 T \\sqrt{3}\n\\]\n\\[\nx^2 = b_2^2 + T^2 - b_2 T \\sqrt{3}\n\\]\n\n### Step 4: Solve for \\(b_1\\) and \\(b_2\\)\nSince \\(x\\) is a side length, it must be positive. Therefore, we have two equations:\n\\[\nx = \\sqrt{b_1^2 + T^2 - b_1 T \\sqrt{3}}\n\\]\n\\[\nx = \\sqrt{b_2^2 + T^2 - b_2 T \\sqrt{3}}\n\\]\n\n### Step 5: Use the fact that \\(x\\) is the same for both values\nSince \\(x\\) is the same for both values, we equate the two expressions:\n\\[\n\\sqrt{b_1^2 + T^2 - b_1 T \\sqrt{3}} = \\sqrt{b_2^2 + T^2 - b_2 T \\sqrt{3}}\n\\]\nSquaring both sides:\n\\[\nb_1^2 + T^2 - b_1 T \\sqrt{3} = b_2^2 + T^2 - b_2 T \\sqrt{3}\n\\]\nSubtracting \\(T^2\\) from both sides:\n\\[\nb_1^2 - b_1 T \\sqrt{3} = b_2^2 - b_2 T \\sqrt{3}\n\\]\nRearranging terms:\n\\[\nb_1^2 - b_2^2 = b_1 T \\sqrt{3} - b_2 T \\sqrt{3}\n\\]\nFactoring both sides:\n\\[\n(b_1 - b_2)(b_1 + b_2) = T \\sqrt{3}(b_1 - b_2)\n\\]\nSince \\(b_1 \\neq b_2\\), we can divide both sides by \\(b_1 - b_2\\):\n\\[\nb_1 + b_2 = T \\sqrt{3}\n\\]\n\n### Step 6: Use the integer values for \\(b_1\\) and \\(b_2\\)\nSince \\(b_1\\) and \\(b_2\\) are integers, \\(T \\sqrt{3}\\) must be an integer. Let \\(T \\sqrt{3} = k\\), where \\(k\\) is an integer. Then:\n\\[\nb_1 + b_2 = k\n\\]\n\n### Step 7: Determine the possible values of \\(k\\)\nSince \\(b_1\\) and \\(b_2\\) are integers, \\(k\\) must be an integer multiple of \\(\\sqrt{3}\\). The possible values of \\(k\\) are \\(3, 6, 9, \\ldots\\).\n\n### Step 8: Count the number of valid \\(k\\) values\nThe possible values of \\(k\\) are \\(3, 6, 9, \\ldots\\). These are the multiples of 3. The number of such values is infinite, but we need to consider the constraints of the problem. The problem states that there are two possible values for \\(AB\\), which implies that \\(k\\) must be such that the quadratic equation in \\(b\\) has two distinct integer solutions.\n\n### Step 9: Verify the number of valid \\(k\\) values\nThe valid \\(k\\) values are \\(3, 6, 9, \\ldots\\). The number of such values is infinite, but the problem states that there are two possible values for \\(AB\\). This implies that \\(k\\) must be such that the quadratic equation in \\(b\\) has two distinct integer solutions. The number of such \\(k\\) values is 11.\n\nThus, the number of integer values of \\(AC\\) for which there are two possible values for side length \\(AB\\) is \\(\\boxed{11}\\)."], "id": 2860, "generated_answers": ["11"], "gold_answer": "5", "is_correct": false, "answers_correctness": [false]}

The points \\(P\\), \\(Q\\), \\(R\\), and \\(S\\) are such that each triangle formed by a side of the square and the points \\(P\\), \\(Q\\), \\(R\\), and \\(S\\) is equilateral. This means that the distance from each vertex of the square to the point on the adjacent side is the same.\n\n### Step 2: Positioning the Points\nLet's place the square \\(ABCD\\) in the coordinate plane with \\(A = (0, 0)\\), \\(B = (1, 0)\\), \\(C = (1, 1)\\), and \\(D = (0, 1)\\).\n\nSince the triangles are equilateral, the points \\(P\\), \\(Q\\), \\(R\\), and \\(S\\) must be equidistant from the vertices of the square. This implies that the points form a smaller square inside the original square.\n\n### Step 3: Determining the Coordinates of \\(P\\), \\(Q\\), \\(R\\), and \\(S\\)\nGiven the symmetry and the fact that the triangles are equilateral, we can deduce the coordinates of the points:\n- \\(P\\) is on \\(AD\\), so \\(P = (0, p)\\)\n- \\(Q\\) is on \\(BC\\), so \\(Q = (1, q)\\)\n- \\(R\\) is on \\(CD\\), so \\(R = (r, 1)\\)\n- \\(S\\) is on \\(DA\\), so \\(S = (s, 0)\\)\n\nSince the triangles are equilateral, the distance from each vertex to the point on the adjacent side is the same. This distance is \\(\\frac{1}{2}\\) because the side length of the square is 1 and the points are equidistant from the vertices.\n\nThus, the coordinates of the points are:\n- \\(P = \\left(0, \\frac{1}{2}\\right)\\)\n- \\(Q = \\left(1, \\frac{1}{2}\\right)\\)\n- \\(R = \\left(\\frac{1}{2}, 1\\right)\\)\n- \\(S = \\left(\\frac{1}{2}, 0\\right)\\)\n\n### Step 4: Calculating the Area of Quadrilateral \\(PQRS\\)\nThe points \\(P\\), \\(Q\\), \\(R\\), and \\(S\\) form a rectangle. The length of the sides of this rectangle are:\n- The horizontal distance between \\(P\\) and \\(Q\\) (or \\(R\\) and \\(S\\)) is \\(1 - \\frac{1}{2} = \\frac{1}{2}\\)\n- The vertical distance between \\(P\\) and \\(S\\) (or \\(Q\\) and \\(R\\)) is \\(\\frac{1}{2} - 0 = \\frac{1}{2}\\)\n\nThe area of the rectangle is:\n\\[\n\\text{Area} = \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right) \\times \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right) = \\frac{1}{4}\n\\]\n\nHowever, the points \\(P\\), \\(Q\\), \\(R\\), and \\(S\\) actually form a smaller square inside the original square.

We will then compute the sum of the elements of \\(\\mathcal{S}\\) and find the remainder when this sum is divided by 10,000.\n\n### Step 1: Understanding the Condition\nAn integer \\( n \\) ends in the same four digits in both base-2 and base-5 if and only if:\n\\[ n \\equiv a \\pmod{16} \\]\n\\[ n \\equiv a \\pmod{625} \\]\nfor some integer \\( a \\). This means:\n\\[ n = 16k + a \\]\n\\[ n = 625m + a \\]\nfor some integers \\( k \\) and \\( m \\).\n\n### Step 2: Finding the Common Solutions\nWe need to find the values of \\( n \\) that satisfy both congruences. The Chinese Remainder Theorem (CRT) can be used to solve this system of congruences. The least common multiple of 16 and 625 is 10000, which is greater than 9999. Therefore, we need to consider the congruences modulo 10000.\n\n### Step 3: Solving the System of Congruences\nWe need to solve:\n\\[ n \\equiv a \\pmod{16} \\]\n\\[ n \\equiv a \\pmod{625} \\]\n\nSince \\( n = 16k + a \\), we substitute into the second congruence:\n\\[ 16k + a \\equiv a \\pmod{625} \\]\nThis simplifies to:\n\\[ 16k \\equiv 0 \\pmod{625} \\]\n\n### Step 4: Simplifying the Congruence\nWe need to find the multiplicative inverse of 16 modulo 625. The multiplicative inverse of 16 modulo 625 is a number \\( x \\) such that:\n\\[ 16x \\equiv 1 \\pmod{625} \\]\n\nUsing the Extended Euclidean Algorithm, we find that:\n\\[ 16 \\times 391 = 625 \\times 1 + 1 \\]\nThus, the inverse of 16 modulo 625 is 391. Therefore:\n\\[ k \\equiv 0 \\pmod{625} \\]\nThis means \\( k = 625m \\) for some integer \\( m \\).\n\n### Step 5: Finding the Values of \\( n \\)\nSubstitute \\( k = 625m \\) back into \\( n = 16k + a \\):\n\\[ n = 16(625m) + a = 10000m + a \\]\n\nSince \\( n \\) must be between 0 and 9999, we have:\n\\[ 0 \\leq a < 16 \\]\n\\[ 0 \\leq 10000m + a < 10000 \\]\n\nThis implies:\n\\[ 0 \\leq m < 1 \\]\n\nThus, \\( m \\) can be 0 or 1.\n\n### Step 6: Counting the Valid \\( n \\)\nFor \\( m = 0 \\):\n\\[ n = a \\]\nwhere \\( a \\) can be any integer from 0 to 15.

{"question": "Eight students attend a Harper Valley ARML practice. At the end of the practice, they decide to take selfies to celebrate the event. Each selfie will have either two or three students in the picture.

Each selfie can have either two or three students.\n\n### Step-by-Step Solution:\n\n1. **Identify the total number of pairs:**\n   The total number of ways to choose 2 students out of 8 is given by the combination formula \\( \\binom{8}{2} \\):\n   \\[\n   \\binom{8}{2} = \\frac{8!}{2!(8-2)!} = \\frac{8 \\times 7}{2 \\times 1} = 28\n   \\]\n   So, there are 28 pairs of students.\n\n2. **Consider the effect of three-student selfies:**\n   Each three-student selfie covers 3 pairs of students. If we have \\( x \\) three-student selfies, they will cover \\( 3x \\) pairs of students.\n\n3. **Set up the equation:**\n   Let \\( x \\) be the number of three-student selfies. The number of two-student selfies required to cover the remaining pairs is \\( \\frac{28 - 3x}{2} \\). Since the number of two-student selfies must be an integer, \\( 28 - 3x \\) must be even. This implies that \\( 3x \\) must be even, which means \\( x \\) must be even.\n\n4. **Minimize the total number of selfies:**\n   To minimize the total number of selfies, we need to maximize the number of three-student selfies. The maximum value of \\( x \\) that is even and fits within the range of 0 to 28 is 28. However, if \\( x = 28 \\), then \\( 28 - 3 \\times 28 = 28 - 84 = -56 \\), which is not possible. Therefore, we need to consider the next largest even number, which is 26.\n\n   If \\( x = 26 \\):\n   \\[\n   28 - 3 \\times 26 = 28 - 78 = -50\n   \\]\n   This is also not possible. Next, we try \\( x = 24 \\):\n   \\[\n   28 - 3 \\times 24 = 28 - 72 = -44\n   \\]\n   This is also not possible. We continue this process until we find a valid number of two-student selfies.\n\n   If \\( x = 22 \\):\n   \\[\n   28 - 3 \\times 22 = 28 - 66 = -38\n   \\]\n   This is not possible.

{"question": "Compute the $2011^{\\text {th }}$ smallest positive integer $N$ that gains an extra digit when doubled.", "generated_responses": ["To solve the problem of finding the \\(2011^{\\text{th}}\\) smallest positive integer \\(N\\) that gains an extra digit when doubled, we need to follow a systematic approach. Let's break it down step by step.\n\n### Step 1: Understanding the Problem\nWe need to find the smallest positive integer \\(N\\) such that when \\(N\\) is doubled, the result has exactly one more digit than \\(N\\). For example, if \\(N\\) is a 3-digit number, then \\(2N\\) must be a 4-digit number.\n\n### Step 2: Analyzing the Number of Digits\nLet \\(N\\) be a \\(k\\)-digit number. Then \\(N\\) can be expressed as:\n\\[ 10^{k-1} \\leq N < 10^k \\]\n\nWhen \\(N\\) is doubled, the result \\(2N\\) must be a \\((k+1)\\)-digit number. Therefore, we have:\n\\[ 10^k \\leq 2N < 10^{k+1} \\]\n\n### Step 3: Solving the Inequality\nFrom the inequality \\(10^k \\leq 2N < 10^{k+1}\\), we can solve for \\(N\\):\n\\[ \\frac{10^k}{2} \\leq N < \\frac{10^{k+1}}{2} \\]\n\n### Step 4: Finding the Smallest \\(N\\)\nTo find the smallest \\(N\\), we need to consider the smallest integer values for \\(k\\) and check the conditions.\n\n#### Case \\(k = 1\\):\n\\[ \\frac{10^1}{2} \\leq N < \\frac{10^2}{2} \\]\n\\[ 5 \\leq N < 50 \\]\nThe smallest \\(N\\) in this range is 5.\n\n#### Case \\(k = 2\\):\n\\[ \\frac{10^2}{2} \\leq N < \\frac{10^3}{2} \\]\n\\[ 50 \\leq N < 500 \\]\nThe smallest \\(N\\) in this range is 50.\n\n#### Case \\(k = 3\\):\n\\[ \\frac{10^3}{2} \\leq N < \\frac{10^4}{2} \\]\n\\[ 500 \\leq N < 5000 \\]\nThe smallest \\(N\\) in this range is 500.\n\n### Step 5: Generalizing the Pattern\nFrom the above cases, we observe that the smallest \\(N\\) for each \\(k\\) is \\(5 \\times 10^{k-1}\\). This is because \\(5\\) is the smallest digit that, when doubled, results in a number that gains exactly one digit.\n\n### Step 6: Finding the \\(2011^{\\text{th}}\\) Smallest \\(N\\)\nWe need to find the \\(2011^{\\text{th}}\\) smallest \\(N\\) that follows this pattern. The sequence of \\(k\\) values for which \\(5 \\times 10^{k-1}\\) is the smallest \\(N\\) is:\n\\[ k = 1, 2, 3, \\ldots \\]\n\nThe number of terms in this sequence up to and including \\(k\\) is \\(k\\).

Since \\( P(x) \\) and \\( Q(x) \\) have the same zeros, the polynomials are related by:\n\\[ P(x) = x^n Q\\left( \\frac{1}{x} \\right) \\]\n\n### Step 4: Simplifying the Relationship\nSubstitute \\( x = 1 \\) into the equation:\n\\[ P(1) = 1^n Q\\left( \\frac{1}{1} \\right) = Q(1) \\]\nThus:\n\\[ a_n + a_{n-1} + \\cdots + a_1 + a_0 = a_0 + a_1 + \\cdots + a_{n-1} + a_n \\]\n\nThis equation is always true, so it does not provide new information. Instead, we need to consider the GCD condition:\n\\[ \\operatorname{GCD}(a_0, a_1, \\ldots, a_n) = 1 \\]\n\n### Step 5: Counting Valid Polynomials\nWe need to count the number of polynomials \\( P(x) \\) such that the GCD of their coefficients is 1. Since the zeros are real and integers, the polynomial can be written as:\n\\[ P(x) = a_n (x - r_1)(x - r_2) \\cdots (x - r_n) \\]\nwhere \\( r_1, r_2, \\ldots, r_n \\) are integers.\n\n### Step 6: Ensuring GCD Condition\nFor the GCD of the coefficients to be 1, the polynomial must be such that the product of the coefficients is 1. This means:\n\\[ a_n \\cdot a_{n-1} \\cdots a_1 \\cdot a_0 = 1 \\]\n\nSince \\( a_n \\) and \\( a_0 \\) are integers, the possible values for \\( a_n \\) and \\( a_0 \\) are \\( \\pm 1 \\). However, if \\( a_n = -1 \\), then \\( a_0 = -1 \\), and if \\( a_n = 1 \\), then \\( a_0 = 1 \\). This ensures that the GCD condition is satisfied.\n\n### Step 7: Counting Valid Polynomials for Each \\( n \\)\nFor each \\( n \\) from 1 to 7, we need to count the number of such polynomials. The number of valid polynomials for each \\( n \\) is given by the number of ways to choose the zeros \\( r_1, r_2, \\ldots, r_n \\) such that the GCD condition is satisfied.\n\nThe number of valid polynomials for each \\( n \\) is:\n- \\( n = 1 \\): 2 (since \\( a_1 \\) can be \\( \\pm 1 \\))\n- \\( n = 2 \\): 4 (since \\( a_2 \\) and \\( a_0 \\) can be \\( \\pm 1 \\))\n- \\( n = 3 \\): 8 (since \\( a_3 \\), \\( a_2 \\), and \\( a_0 \\) can be \\( \\pm 1 \\))\n- \\( n = 4 \\): 16 (since \\( a_4 \\), \\( a_3 \\), \\( a_2 \\), and \\( a_0 \\) can be \\( \\pm 1 \\))\n- \\( n = 5 \\): 32 (since \\( a_5 \\), \\( a_4 \\), \\( a_3 \\), \\( a_2 \\), and \\( a_0 \\) can be \\( \\pm 1 \\))\n- \\( n = 6 \\): 64 (since \\( a_6 \\), \\( a_5 \\), \\( a_4 \\), \\( a_3 \\), \\( a_2 \\), and \\( a_0 \\) can be \\( \\pm 1 \\))\n- \\( n = 7 \\): 128 (since \\( a_7 \\), \\( a_6 \\), \\( a_5 \\), \\( a_4 \\), \\( a_3 \\), \\( a_2 \\), and \\( a_0 \\) can be \\( \\pm 1 \\))\n\n### Step 8: Summing the Number of Valid Polynomials\nSumming these values:\n\\[ 2 + 4 + 8 + 16 + 32 + 64 + 128 = 254 \\]\n\nHowever, we need to ensure that the GCD condition is satisfied. For each \\( n \\), the number of valid polynomials is actually:\n\\[ 2^n \\]\n\nThus, the total number of valid polynomials is:\n\\[ 2^1 + 2^2 + 2^3 + 2^4 + 2^5 + 2^6 + 2^7 = 2 + 4 + 8 + 16 + 32 + 64 + 128 = 254 \\]\n\nTherefore, the number of such polynomials is:\n\\boxed{111}"], "id": 3085, "generated_answers": ["111"], "gold_answer": "70", "is_correct": false, "answers_correctness": [false]}

Compute the number of noncongruent triangles that can be formed in this manner.", "generated_responses": ["To solve the problem of forming noncongruent triangles by extending three sides of a regular 16-gon, we need to follow a systematic approach. Let's break it down step by step.\n\n### Step 1: Identify the vertices of the 16-gon\nA regular 16-gon has 16 vertices, which we can label as \\( A_1, A_2, \\ldots, A_{16} \\).\n\n### Step 2: Choose three sides to extend\nWe need to choose three sides of the 16-gon to extend.

We need to count the number of sets of three extended sides that remain unchanged under the action of each symmetry.\n\n- **Identity rotation (1 way):** All \\(\\binom{16}{3}\\) sets are fixed under

fixed.\n- **Reflections across the 8 axes of symmetry (8 ways):** Each reflection can be paired with another reflection to form a set of three extended sides that is fixed under the reflection.\n\nUsing Burnside's Lemma, the number of distinct sets is:\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{32} \\left( 560 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 +
