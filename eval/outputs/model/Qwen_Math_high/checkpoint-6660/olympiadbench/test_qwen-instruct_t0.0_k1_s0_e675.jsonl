This means that the polynomial must be symmetric and invariant under rotation and reflection of the \\( 2n \\)-gon.\n\n### Step 2: Symmetry and Invariance\nA regular \\( 2n \\)-gon has \\( 4n \\) symmetries (rotations and reflections). The polynomial \\( f \\) must be invariant under these symmetries.

This configuration is non-trivial and requires a polynomial of a certain degree to describe it.\n\n### Step 5: Degree of the Polynomial of a Regular \\( 2n \\)-gon\nThe polynomial that describes a regular \\( 2n \\)-gon in the plane is known to be of degree \\( 2n \\).

There are no arrows \\(\\overrightarrow{A B}\\) and \\(\\overrightarrow{C D}\\) such that \\(A B C D\\) is a convex quadrangle oriented clockwise.\n\n### Step 2: Analyzing the Cross-Intersection Condition\nFor a configuration to be good, no two arrows can cross. This means that if we draw the arrows, they must not intersect each other. This condition is equivalent to the requirement that the configuration must be a non-regular polygon with all sides of equal length and all internal angles equal.\n\n### Step 3: Analyzing the Quadrangle Condition\nThe second condition states that there are no arrows \\(\\overrightarrow{A B}\\) and \\(\\overrightarrow{C D}\\) such that \\(A B C D\\) is a convex quadrangle oriented clockwise. This means that for any four points \\(A, B, C, D\\) in the configuration, the quadrangle \\(A B C D\\) must not be convex.\n\n### Step 4: Constructing a Good Configuration\nTo construct a good configuration, we need to ensure that the points are arranged such that no two arrows cross and no four points form a convex quadrangle. One way to achieve this is to arrange the points in a non-regular polygon configuration where the points are equally spaced and the internal angles are equal.\n\n### Step 5: Counting the Number of Good Configurations\nThe number of ways to arrange \\(2n\\) points in a non-regular polygon configuration is equivalent to the number of ways to choose \\(n\\) points out of \\(2n\\) to be the endpoints of the arrows. This is given by the binomial coefficient \\(\\binom{2n}{n}\\).\n\nHowever, we need to ensure that the configuration is good, which means we need to avoid the formation of convex quadrangles. This condition reduces the number of valid configurations. To count the number of good configurations, we need to consider the constraints on the internal angles and the non-regularity of the polygon.\n\n### Step 6: Using Symmetry and Counting\nThe number of good configurations can be determined by considering the symmetries of the polygon and the constraints on the internal angles.

This means that \\(a_n \\equiv a_{n+k} \\pmod{k}\\) for all \\(n\\).\n\n### Step 2: Periodicity and Cubic Polynomials\nFor \\(a_n = n^3 + bn^2 + cn + d\\) to be periodic modulo \\(k\\), the polynomial \\(n^3 + bn^2 + cn + d\\) must be periodic modulo \\(k\\). This implies that the polynomial \\(n^3 + bn^2 + cn + d\\) must be a sum of polynomials of lower degree that are periodic modulo \\(k\\).\n\n### Step 3: Polynomial Decomposition\nWe need to decompose \\(n^3 + bn^2 + cn + d\\) into a sum of polynomials of lower degree. The polynomial \\(n^3\\) is not periodic modulo \\(k\\) for any \\(k > 1\\). Therefore, \\(n^3\\) must be canceled out by a corresponding term in the sequence.

A set of \\( N \\) flags is considered diverse if they can be arranged into an \\( N \\times N \\) square such that all \\( N \\) fields on its main diagonal have the same color.\n\n### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Understanding the Problem:**\n   - Each flag is an \\( N \\)-unit wide and 1-unit high, composed of \\( N \\) fields of size \\( 1 \\times 1 \\).\n   - Each field can be either yellow or blue.\n   - No two countries have the same flag.\n   - We need to find the smallest \\( M \\) such that among any \\( M \\) distinct flags, there exist \\( N \\) flags that can be arranged into an \\( N \\times N \\) square with all main diagonal fields having the same color.\n\n2. **Counting the Total Number of Flags:**\n   - There are \\( 2^N \\) possible flags, each corresponding to a unique combination of \\( N \\) fields being either yellow or blue.\n\n3. **Analyzing the Diagonal Condition:**\n   - For a set of \\( N \\) flags to be diverse, the main diagonal of the \\( N \\times N \\) square must have all the same color.\n   - This means that for each flag in the set, the color of the main diagonal field must be consistent.\n\n4. **Using the Pigeonhole Principle:**\n   - Consider the main diagonal of the \\( N \\times N \\) square. There are \\( N \\) positions on the diagonal.\n   - Each position on the diagonal can be either yellow or blue.\n   - If we have \\( N \\) flags, each flag can be placed in \\( N! \\) different ways on the \\( N \\times N \\) square.\n\n5. **Finding the Smallest \\( M \\):**\n   - We need to find the smallest \\( M \\) such that among any \\( M \\) distinct flags, there exist \\( N \\) flags that can be arranged into an \\( N \\times N \\) square with all main diagonal fields having the same color.\n   - The key insight is that if we have \\( N \\) flags, we can always find a way to arrange them such that the main diagonal fields are consistent.\n\n6. **Using the Pigeonhole Principle to Ensure Consistency:**\n   - If we have \\( N \\) flags, we can always find a way to arrange them such that the main diagonal fields are consistent.\n   - This is because the number of ways to arrange \\( N \\) flags in an \\( N \\times N \\) square is \\( N! \\), and we can always find a permutation that ensures the main diagonal fields are consistent.\n\n7. **Conclusion:**\n   - The smallest \\( M \\) such that among any \\( M \\) distinct flags, there exist \\( N \\) flags forming a diverse set is \\( N \\).\n\nThus, the smallest positive integer \\( M \\) is \\(\\boxed{N}\\)."], "id": 1723, "generated_answers": ["N"], "gold_answer": "$M=2^{N-2}+1$", "is_correct": false, "answers_correctness": [false]}

This constraint ensures that the kings are not adjacent to each other.\n2. **Each Row and Each Column Contains Exactly 25 Kings**: This constraint ensures that the distribution of kings is uniform across the board.\n\n### Step 2: Analyzing the Board\n- The board is a \\(100 \\times 100\\) grid, which can be divided into 100 rows and 100 columns.\n- Each row and each column must contain exactly 25 kings.\n\n### Step 3: Placing the Kings\n- Since each row must contain exactly 25 kings, we can place the kings in a systematic pattern.

Each term \\( f_i(x)^2 \\) on the right-hand side is a square of a polynomial, and the degree of \\( f_i(x)^2 \\) is twice the degree of \\( f_i(x) \\).\n\nFor the equation to hold, the degrees of the polynomials on both sides must be equal.

This is because the degree of \\( f_i(x)^2 \\) must be an even number, and the only even numbers that can sum to 2 are 0 and 2. However, if any \\( f_i(x) \\) were of degree 2, the sum of the degrees would be at least 4, which is not possible.\n\n### Step 3: Analyze the Case with Degree 0 and Degree 1\nWe need to check if it is possible to express \\( x^2 + 7 \\) as a sum of squares of polynomials of degree 0 and degree 1.\n\n#### Case 1: \\( x^2 + 7 = f_1(x)^2 + f_2(x)^2 \\)\n- If \\( f_1(x) \\) is of degree 0, then \\( f_1(x) = a \\) for some constant \\( a \\).\n- If \\( f_2(x) \\) is of degree 1, then \\( f_2(x) = bx + c \\) for some constants \\( b \\) and \\( c \\).\n\nThus, the equation becomes:\n\\[\nx^2 + 7 = a^2 + (bx + c)^2\n\\]\nExpanding and simplifying:\n\\[\nx^2 + 7 = a^2 + b^2x^2 + 2bcx + c^2\n\\]\n\\[\nx^2 + 7 = (a^2 + b^2)x^2 + 2bcx + c^2\n\\]\n\nFor this equation to hold for all \\( x \\), the coefficients of corresponding powers of \\( x \\) must be equal:\n\\[\na^2 + b^2 = 1\n\\]\n\\[\n2bc = 0\n\\]\n\\[\nc^2 = 7\n\\]\n\nFrom \\( 2bc = 0 \\), either \\( b = 0 \\) or \\( c = 0 \\).\n\n- If \\( b = 0 \\), then \\( a^2 = 1 \\) and \\( c^2 = 7 \\).

We need to find the maximum possible number of isosceles triangles with two odd sides that can be formed by 2003 nonintersecting diagonals.\n\n### Step 2: Analyzing the Diagonals\nFor a diagonal to be odd, the number of sides on each side of the diagonal must be odd.

The board is a \\( 2n \\times 2n \\) grid.\n   - A \\( 1 \\times 2 \\) domino can be placed horizontally or vertically, covering two adjacent cells.\n   - A \\( 2 \\times 1 \\) domino can be placed horizontally or vertically, covering two adjacent cells.\n\n2. **Total Number of Cells:**\n   - The total number of cells on the board is \\( (2n)^2 = 4n^2 \\).\n\n3. **Number of Dominoes:**\n   - To cover the entire board, we need \\( 2n^2 \\) dominoes (since each domino covers 2 cells).\n\n4. **Types of Dominoes:**\n   - We have two types of dominoes: \\( 1 \\times 2 \\) and \\( 2 \\times 1 \\).\n   - Each \\( 1 \\times 2 \\) domino can be placed in 2 orientations (horizontal or vertical).\n   - Each \\( 2 \\times 1 \\) domino can be placed in 2 orientations (horizontal or vertical).\n\n5. **Counting the Orientations:**\n   - The total number of ways to place the dominoes is \\( 2 \\times 2 = 4 \\) for each pair of adjacent cells.\n\n6. **Unique Partition:**\n   - For there to be a unique partition of the board into \\( 1 \\times 2 \\) and \\( 2 \\times 1 \\) dominoes, the placement of the dominoes must be such that there is only one way to partition the board into these dominoes.\n\n7. **Marking the Board:**\n   -

This means that at each step, George chooses the number \\( x_i \\) such that the absolute value of the partial sum \\( x_1 + x_2 + \\cdots + x_i \\) is minimized.\n\n### Step 3: Analyzing the Strategy\nTo minimize \\( G \\), George needs to balance the partial sums as much as possible. This is because the maximum absolute value of the partial sums will be minimized if the partial sums themselves are as close to each other as possible.\n\n### Step 4: Using the Median\nThe median of a sequence of numbers is the middle value when the sequence is sorted in ascending order. If the sequence has an odd number of elements, the median is the middle element. If the sequence has an even number of elements, the median is the average of the two middle elements.\n\n### Step 5: Applying the Median Strategy\nTo minimize \\( G \\), George can use the median of the sequence. The median will ensure that the partial sums are as close to each other as possible. Specifically, if the sequence is sorted in ascending order, the median will be the middle element, and the partial sums will be balanced around this median.\n\n### Step 6: Calculating the Price \\( G \\)\nIf the sequence is sorted in ascending order, the median will be the middle element. The partial sums will be:\n\\[\nx_1, x_1 + x_2, x_1 + x_2 + x_3, \\ldots, x_1 + x_2 + \\cdots + x_n\n\\]\nThe maximum absolute value of these partial sums will be minimized if the median is used as the central element.\n\n### Step 7: Relating \\( G \\) and \\( D \\)\nSince the median is used to balance the partial sums, the maximum absolute value of the partial sums \\( G \\) will be at most twice the median. This is because the median is the middle element, and the maximum absolute value of the partial sums will be at most twice the median.\n\n### Step 8: Finding the Constant \\( c \\)\nTo find the least possible constant \\( c \\) such that \\( G \\leq cD \\), we need to consider the worst-case scenario. In the worst case, the median is not used, and the maximum absolute value of the partial sums \\( G \\) will be at most twice the maximum absolute value of the sequence \\( D \\).\n\nThus, the least possible constant \\( c \\) is:\n\\[\nc = 2\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the least possible constant \\( c \\) such that for every positive integer \\( n \\), for every collection of \\( n \\) real numbers, and for every possible sequence that George might obtain, the resulting values satisfy the inequality \\( G \\leq cD \\) is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{2}\n\\]"], "id": 1968, "generated_answers": ["2"], "gold_answer": "2", "is_correct": true, "answers_correctness": [true]}

The smallest \\( k \\) that can be used to form a \\( k \\)-clique with more than 200 elements is 841.

Thus, \\( m = 2 \\).\n   - For \\( k = 2 \\), the possible grids are \\( \\begin{pmatrix} A & A \\\\ A & A \\end{pmatrix} \\), \\( \\begin{pmatrix} A & B \\\\ A & B \\end{pmatrix} \\), \\( \\begin{pmatrix} B & A \\\\ B & A \\end{pmatrix} \\), and \\( \\begin{pmatrix} B & B \\\\ B & B \\end{pmatrix} \\).

Since the marbles are congruent and tangent to each other, they form a regular polyhedron when their centers are connected.\n\n### Step 2: Identify the shape of the polyhedron\nThe centers of the five marbles form a regular pentahedron (a pyramid with a square base).

However, eighteen families arrive and are looking to move in. After much debate, the connotations of using negative house numbers are deemed unacceptable, and the city decides on an alternative plan. On July 17, Shewad Movers arrive and relocate every family from house $n$ to house $n+18$, for all positive $n$ (so that City Hall does not move).

Continuing in that way, he visits houses $n_{3}, n_{4}, \\ldots$, and each time, $d\\left(n_{i}, n_{i+1}\\right)=1 / 3$.

The mode is the number that appears most frequently in the list.\n   - Since the mode is \\(a+2\\), \\(a+2\\) must appear more frequently than \\(a\\) and \\(a+1\\).\n\n5. **Construct the list:**\n   - The list must have \\(a+2\\) as the mode, so it must contain at least two \\(a+2\\)'s.\n   - The list must also have \\(a+1\\) as the median, so it must contain at least one \\(a+1\\).\n   - The list must also have \\(a\\) as the mean, so the sum of the integers must be \\(a \\cdot n\\).\n\n6. **Find the smallest possible list:**\n   - Start with the smallest possible value for \\(a\\), which is 1.\n   - If \\(a = 1\\), then the mean is 1, the median is 2, and the mode is 3.\n   - The list must contain at least two 3's and one 2.\n\n7. **Verify the list:**\n   - Let's try the list \\(3, 3, 2\\):\n     - The mean is \\(\\frac{3 + 3 + 2}{3} = \\frac{8}{3} \\approx 2.67\\), which is not 1.\n   - Let's try the list \\(3, 3, 3, 2\\):\n     - The mean is \\(\\frac{3 + 3 + 3 + 2}{4} = \\frac{11}{4} = 2.75\\), which is not 1.\n   -

Given \\( L E = 5\\sqrt{2} \\), we have:\n\\[\nL E = \\sqrt{h^2 + (\\text{distance from } O \\text{ to } E)^2}\n\\]\nSince \\( E \\) is a vertex of the base and \\( O \\) is the center, the distance from \\( O \\) to \\( E \\) is \\( \\sqrt{2} \\). Therefore:\n\\[\n5\\sqrt{2} = \\sqrt{h^2 + (\\sqrt{2})^2}\n\\]\n\\[\n5\\sqrt{2} = \\sqrt{h^2 + 2}\n\\]\nSquaring both sides:\n\\[\n(5\\sqrt{2})^2 = h^2 + 2\n\\]\n\\[\n50 = h^2 + 2\n\\]\n\\[\nh^2 = 48\n\\]\n\\[\nh = \\sqrt{48} = 4\\sqrt{3}\n\\]\n\n### Step 4: Calculate the area of triangle \\( \\triangle LEB \\)\nThe area of triangle \\( \\triangle LEB \\) can be found using the base \\( EB \\) and the height from \\( L \\) to \\( EB \\). The base \\( EB \\) is a side of the square, so:\n\\[\nEB = 2\n\\]\nThe height from \\( L \\) to \\( EB \\) is the height of the pyramid \\( h = 4\\sqrt{3} \\). Therefore, the area of \\( \\triangle LEB \\) is:\n\\[\n\\text{Area} = \\frac{1}{2} \\times \\text{base} \\times \\text{height} = \\frac{1}{2} \\times 2 \\times 4\\sqrt{3} = 4\\sqrt{3}\n\\]\n\nThus, the area of triangle \\( \\triangle LEB \\) is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{4\\sqrt{3}}\n\\]"], "id": 2784, "generated_answers": ["4\\sqrt{3}"], "gold_answer": "7", "is_correct": false, "answers_correctness": [false]}

The discriminant \\(\\Delta\\) of the quadratic equation \\(c^2 - 2c + (T^2 - \\frac{T^2}{4 \\sin^2 A} + \\frac{T^2 \\sqrt{3}}{2 \\sin A}) = 0\\) must be positive.\n\n### Step 5: Calculate the discriminant\nThe discriminant \\(\\Delta\\) is:\n\\[\n\\Delta = 4 - 4 \\left(T^2 - \\frac{T^2}{4 \\sin^2 A} + \\frac{T^2 \\sqrt{3}}{2 \\sin A}\\right)\n\\]\n\\[\n\\Delta = 4 - 4T^2 + \\frac{T^2}{\\sin^2 A} - 2T^2 \\sqrt{3} \\sin A\n\\]\n\\[\n\\Delta = 4 - 4T^2 + \\frac{T^2}{\\sin^2 A} - 2T^2 \\sqrt{3} \\sin A\n\\]\n\n### Step 6: Simplify and solve for \\(\\sin A\\)\nFor there to be two possible values for \\(c\\), \\(\\Delta > 0\\). We need to find the range of \\(\\sin A\\) such that this inequality holds. After solving, we find that \\(\\sin A\\) must be in the range \\(\\frac{1}{2} < \\sin A < \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}\\).\n\n### Step 7: Determine the integer values of \\(AC\\)\nGiven the range of \\(\\sin A\\), we find that the possible integer values of \\(AC\\) are 5 and 6. Therefore, there are 2 possible integer values for \\(AC\\).\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{2}\n\\]"], "id": 2860, "generated_answers": ["2"], "gold_answer": "5", "is_correct": false, "answers_correctness": [false]}

Let \\( a \\) be the semi-major axis and \\( b \\) be the semi-minor axis.

Let's proceed step by step.\n\n### Step 1: Understanding the Sequence\nThe given sequence is:\n\\[ 1^2, 2^2, 3^2, \\ldots, 10^2 \\]\nThis is the sequence of squares of the first 10 positive integers.\n\n### Step 2: Define the Arithmetic Progression\nAn arithmetic progression (AP) is a sequence where the difference between consecutive terms is constant. Let's denote the first term of the AP by \\(a\\) and the common difference by \\(d\\). The terms of the AP can be written as:\n\\[ a, a+d, a+2d, \\ldots, a+9d \\]\n\n### Step 3: Setting Up the Equations\nWe need to match the given sequence to the AP.

The common difference between consecutive terms is indeed \\(3\\), so this is an arithmetic progression.\n\n### Step 6: Counting the Morphs\nTo transform the given sequence into the arithmetic progression, we need to apply the morph operation.

Since \\(N\\) must be a 1-digit number, we can list the 1-digit numbers and their doubles:\n- \\(N = 1\\), \\(2N = 2\\)\n- \\(N = 2\\), \\(2N = 4\\)\n- \\(N = 3\\), \\(2N = 6\\)\n- \\(N = 4\\), \\(2N = 8\\)\n- \\(N = 5\\), \\(2N = 10\\)\n- \\(N = 6\\), \\(2N = 12\\)\n- \\(N = 7\\), \\(2N = 14\\)\n- \\(N = 8\\), \\(2N = 16\\)\n- \\(N = 9\\), \\(2N = 18\\)\n\nFrom this list, we see that \\(N = 5\\) is the smallest number that gains an extra digit when doubled.\n\n### Step 5: Verifying the \\(2011^{\\text{th}}\\) Smallest \\(N\\)\nSince \\(N = 5\\) is the smallest number that gains an extra digit when doubled, and we need the \\(2011^{\\text{th}}\\) smallest \\(N\\), we need to find the 2011th number in the sequence of 1-digit numbers that gain an extra digit when doubled.\n\nThe sequence of 1-digit numbers that gain an extra digit when doubled is:\n\\[ 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, "], "id": 3034, "generated_answers": [""], "gold_answer": "6455", "is_correct": false, "answers_correctness": [false]}
