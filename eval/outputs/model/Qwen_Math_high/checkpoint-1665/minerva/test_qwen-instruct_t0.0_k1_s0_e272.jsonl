In an acidic environment, the uncharged form of arginine (arginine) will be protonated to form the cation (arginine cation).\n\n3. ** Ionization of arginine:**\n   - The first ionization of arginine occurs at \\(\\text{pH} \\approx 10.5\\), which is much higher than 1.0. Therefore, at \\(\\text{pH} = 1.0\\), the first ionization does not occur.\n   - The second ionization of arginine occurs at \\(\\text{pH} \\approx 12.5\\), which is also much higher than 1.0. Therefore, at \\(\\text{pH} = 1.0\\), the second ionization does not occur either.\n\n4. **Conclusion:**\n   - Since neither of the ionizations of arginine occur at \\(\\text{pH} = 1.0\\), the uncharged form of arginine (arginine) is the only form present in the solution.\n\n5. **Net charge:**\n   - The uncharged form of arginine has a net charge of 0.\n\nThus, the net charge of arginine in a solution of \\(\\text{pH} = 1.0\\) is \\(\\boxed{0}\\)."], "generated_answers": ["0"], "gold_answer": "+2", "is_correct": false, "answers_correctness": [false]}
