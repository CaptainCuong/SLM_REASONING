Let's break this down step by step.\n\n### Step 1: Define the Problem\nWe are given a positive integer \\(n\\) and its weight \\(w(n)\\) is defined as the number of 1s in its binary representation. We need to count the number of positive integers \\(k\\) such that \\(k \\leq 2^{2017}\\) and \\(w(k)\\) is even, and the number of positive integers \\(k\\) such that \\(k \\leq 2^{2017}\\) and \\(w(k)\\) is odd.\n\n### Step 2: Use the Binomial Distribution\nThe weight \\(w(k)\\) of a number \\(k\\) is the number of 1s in its binary representation. For \\(k \\leq 2^{2017}\\), \\(k\\) can be any integer from 1 to \\(2^{2017}\\). The number of 1s in the binary representation of \\(k\\) follows a binomial distribution with parameters \\(n = 2017\\) and \\(p = 0.5\\).\n\n### Step 3: Calculate the Mean and Standard Deviation\nThe mean \\(\\mu\\) of the binomial distribution is given by:\n\\[\n\\mu = n \\cdot p = 2017 \\cdot 0.5 = 1008.5\n\\]\nThe standard deviation \\(\\sigma\\) is given by:\n\\[\n\\sigma = \\sqrt{n \\cdot p \\cdot (1-p)} = \\sqrt{2017 \\cdot 0.5 \\cdot 0.5} = \\sqrt{504.25} \\approx 22.45\n\\]\n\n### Step 4: Approximate the Binomial Distribution\nFor large \\(n\\), the binomial distribution can be approximated by a normal distribution with mean \\(\\mu\\) and standard deviation \\(\\sigma\\). We need to find the probability that \\(w(k)\\) is even and the probability that \\(w(k)\\) is odd.\n\n### Step 5: Use the Symmetry of the Normal Distribution\nThe normal distribution is symmetric around its mean. Therefore, the probability that \\(w(k)\\) is even is approximately the same as the probability that \\(w(k)\\) is odd. Each integer \\(k\\) has a 50% chance of having an even weight and a 50% chance of having an odd weight.\n\n### Step 6: Count the Total Number of Integers\nThe total number of positive integers \\(k\\) such that \\(k \\leq 2^{2017}\\) is:\n\\[\n2^{2017}\n\\]\n\n### Step 7: Calculate the Difference\nSince the probabilities of \\(w(k)\\) being even and odd are approximately equal, the number of integers with even weight and the number of integers with odd weight are also approximately equal. Therefore, the difference between the number of integers with even weight and the number of integers with odd weight is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{2^{2016}}\n\\]"], "id": 1612, "generated_answers": ["2^{2016}"], "gold_answer": "$2^{1009}$", "is_correct": false, "answers_correctness": [false]}

This means that for any subset of the collection, the union of the subsets in that subset must not be a proper subset of \\( X \\) and must not have any element of \\( X \\) that lies in exactly one of the subsets in that subset.\n\n### Step 4: Constructing the Collection\nConsider the collection of all subsets of \\( X \\) that do not contain a specific element \\( x \\in X \\). This collection is:\n\\[ \\{ A \\subseteq X \\mid x \\notin A \\} \\]\n\n### Step 5: Verifying the Collection\n- Each subset in this collection is proper because it does not contain \\( x \\).\n- The union of any subcollection of these subsets is not a proper subset of \\( X \\) because it always contains \\( x \\).\n- No element of \\( X \\) lies in exactly one of the subsets in this collection because every subset does not contain \\( x \\).\n\n### Step 6: Counting the Subsets\nThe number of subsets of \\( X \\) that do not contain \\( x \\) is the same as the number of subsets of \\( X \\setminus \\{x\\} \\), which is \\( 2^{n-1} \\).\n\n### Step 7: Conclusion\nThe largest cardinality of a collection of proper non-empty subsets of \\( X \\) such that no non-empty subcollection of these subsets is tight is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{2^{n-1}}\n\\]"], "id": 1614, "generated_answers": ["2^{n-1}"], "gold_answer": "$2n-2$", "is_correct": false, "answers_correctness": [false]}

The equation of the plane is:\n   \\[\n   a(x - x_0) + b(y - y_0) + c(z - z_0) = 0\n   \\]\n   For a plane not to pass through the origin, the point \\((0, 0, 0)\\) must not satisfy the equation of the plane.\n\n4. **Strategy to Find the Smallest Number of Planes**:\n   We can use the fact that the points in \\( S \\) are symmetrically distributed around the origin. We can divide the space into regions by planes that are equidistant from the origin and cover all points in \\( S \\).\n\n5. **Divide the Space into Regions**:\n   Consider the planes \\( x = 0 \\), \\( y = 0 \\), and \\( z = 0 \\). These planes divide the space into 8 regions. Each region contains points \\((x, y, z)\\) where \\( x, y, z \\) are either all non-negative or all non-positive. Since \\( x, y, z \\in \\{0, 1, \\ldots, n\\} \\) and \\( x + y + z > 0 \\), we exclude the region where \\( x = y = z = 0 \\).\n\n6. **Count the Regions**:\n   Each of the 8 regions contains points from \\( S \\). Therefore, we need to cover all 8 regions with planes that do not pass through the origin.\n\n7. **Conclusion**:\n   The smallest number of planes that can cover all points in \\( S \\) without passing through the origin is 3. These planes are \\( x = 0 \\), \\( y = 0 \\), and \\( z = 0 \\).\n\nThus, the final answer is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{3}\n\\]"], "id": 1662, "generated_answers": ["3"], "gold_answer": "$3 n$", "is_correct": false, "answers_correctness": [false]}

Let's break down the problem step by step.\n\n1. **Understanding the Movement**:\n   - Each ant starts at the midpoint of a unit square and moves with speed 1 parallel to some edge of the checkerboard.\n   - When two ants moving in opposite directions meet, they both turn \\(90^\\circ\\) clockwise.\n   - When more than two ants meet or when two ants moving in perpendicular directions meet, they continue moving in the same direction as before they met.\n   - When an ant reaches one of the edges of the checkerboard, it falls off.\n\n2. **Modeling the Movement**:\n   - We can model the movement of ants as a system of vectors in a 2-dimensional plane.\n   - Each ant's position can be represented as a point \\((x, y)\\) on the checkerboard, where \\(0 \\leq x, y < m\\).\n\n3. **Vector Representation**:\n   - Each ant's movement can be represented as a vector \\(\\vec{v} = (a, b)\\) where \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are integers.\n   - The magnitude of the vector \\(\\vec{v}\\) is 1, so \\(\\|\\vec{v}\\| = 1\\).\n\n4. **Possible Vectors**:\n   - The possible vectors \\(\\vec{v}\\) are \\((1, 0)\\), \\((0, 1)\\), \\((-1, 0)\\), and \\((0, -1)\\).\n\n5. **Movement Analysis**:\n   - When two ants meet, their vectors are combined according to the rules of vector addition.\n   - The vectors \\((1, 0)\\) and \\((-1, 0)\\) will cancel each other out, as will \\((0, 1)\\) and \\((0, -1)\\).\n\n6. **Latest Possible Moment**:\n   - To find the latest possible moment at which the last ant falls off the checkerboard, we need to consider the maximum time it takes for all ants to fall off.\n   - The maximum time occurs when the ants are distributed in such a way that they take the longest to reach the edges.\n\n7. **Symmetry and Equal Distribution**:\n   - If the ants are distributed equally among the four possible directions, the system will be balanced and the ants will take the longest to reach the edges.\n   - In this scenario, each ant will move in one of the four directions, and the system will be symmetric.\n\n8. **Time Calculation**:\n   - The time it takes for an ant to reach the edge of the checkerboard is \\(m\\).\n   - Since the ants are moving in a balanced manner, the last ant will fall off after \\(m\\) units of time.\n\nTherefore, the latest possible moment at which the last ant falls off the checkerboard is \\(\\boxed{m}\\)."], "id": 1695, "generated_answers": ["m"], "gold_answer": "$\\frac{3 m}{2}-1$", "is_correct": false, "answers_correctness": [false]}

Let's break down the problem step by step.\n\n### Step 1: Understanding the Constraints\n1. **No King Captures Another King**: Each king must be placed in a square such that no two kings are adjacent (i.e., no two kings share a common vertex).\n2. **Each Row and Each Column Contains Exactly 25 Kings**: This means we need to place exactly 25 kings in each row and each column.\n\n### Step 2: Representing the Problem\nWe can represent the placement of kings as a 100 by 100 grid where each cell \\((i, j)\\) contains a 1 if there is a king in the \\(i\\)-th row and \\(j\\)-th column, and a 0 otherwise. This grid is a 100 by 100 0-1 matrix with exactly 25 ones in each row and each column.\n\n### Step 3: Permutations and Permutations Matrices\nA 100 by 100 0-1 matrix with exactly 25 ones in each row and each column is a permutation matrix. Each permutation matrix corresponds to a permutation of the columns of a 100 by 100 identity matrix.\n\n### Step 4: Counting Permutations\nThe number of permutations of 100 columns is given by \\(100!\\). However, we need to ensure that no two kings are adjacent. This constraint reduces the number of valid permutations.\n\n### Step 5: Valid Permutations\nTo ensure no two kings are adjacent, we need to consider the structure of the permutation. Each permutation \\(\\sigma\\) of the columns must be such that for any \\(i\\), \\(\\sigma(i)\\) and \\(\\sigma(i+1)\\) are not adjacent. This is a complex constraint, but we can use the fact that the problem is symmetric and the structure of the grid to simplify our counting.\n\n### Step 6: Symmetry and Simplification\nGiven the symmetry of the problem, we can focus on counting the number of valid permutations starting with a specific column, say column 1. The total number of valid permutations will be the same for any starting column.\n\n### Step 7: Counting Valid Permutations Starting with Column 1\nIf we fix one of the columns (say column 1) to be the first column, we need to count the number of permutations of the remaining 99 columns such that no two adjacent columns are adjacent. This is equivalent to counting the number of permutations of 99 columns with the same constraint.\n\n### Step 8: Using Known Results\nIt is known from combinatorial mathematics that the number of permutations of \\(n\\) columns with no two adjacent columns being adjacent is given by the number of permutations of \\(n\\) columns with no fixed points (i.e., no element appears in its original position). This is the number of derangements of \\(n\\), denoted \\(D(n)\\).\n\nThe number of derangements \\(D(n)\\) is given by:\n\\[\nD(n) = n! \\sum_{k=0}^{n} \\frac{(-1)^k}{k!}\n\\]\n\nFor \\(n = 99\\):\n\\[\nD(99) = 99! \\sum_{k=0}^{99} \\frac{(-1)^k}{k!}\n\\]\n\n### Step 9: Total Number of Valid Permutations\nSince there are 100 columns and each starting column (1 through 100) can be the first column, the total number of valid permutations is:\n\\[\n100 \\times D(99)\n\\]\n\n### Step 10: Final Answer\nThus, the number of such arrangements is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{100 \\times 99! \\sum_{k=0}^{99} \\frac{(-1)^k}{k!}}\n\\]"], "id": 1724, "generated_answers": ["100 \\times 99! \\sum_{k=0}^{99} \\frac{(-1)^k}{k!}"], "gold_answer": "2", "is_correct": false, "answers_correctness": [false]}

Since \\( c \\) ranges from 1 to 2017, we need to find \\( m \\) such that \\( c \\cdot m \\) is a power of 2 or 5 for some \\( c \\).\n\n### Step 4: Counting \\( m \\)-tastic Numbers\nThe \\( m \\)-tastic numbers are those \\( t \\) for which \\( \\frac{10^t - 1}{c \\cdot m} \\) is a short rational number for some \\( c \\) and \\( \\frac{10^k - 1}{c \\cdot m} \\) is not a short rational number for any \\( 1 \\leq k < t \\).\n\n### Step 5: Using Euler's Totient Function\nThe number of \\( m \\)-tastic numbers is related to the Euler's totient function \\( \\phi(m) \\), which counts the number of integers up to \\( m \\) that are coprime to \\( m \\). The maximum value of \\( \\phi(m) \\) for \\( m \\leq 2017 \\) is 1008, which occurs for \\( m = 1008 \\).\n\n### Step 6: Verifying the Maximum Number of Elements in \\( S(m) \\)\nThe maximum number of elements in \\( S(m) \\) is the maximum value of \\( \\phi(m) \\) for \\( m \\leq 2017 \\), which is 1008.\n\nThus, the maximum number of elements in \\( S(m) \\) is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{1008}\n\\]"], "id": 1832, "generated_answers": ["1008"], "gold_answer": "807", "is_correct": false, "answers_correctness": [false]}

These divisors must be placed in a rectangular table with \\( r \\) rows and \\( c \\) columns such that each row sum and each column sum is the same.\n\n### Step 3: Sum of the Divisors\nThe sum of all divisors of \\( n \\) is given by:\n\\[\n\\sigma(n) = d_1 + d_2 + \\cdots + d_k\n\\]\n\n### Step 4: Equal Row and Column Sums\nSince there are \\( r \\) rows and \\( c \\) columns, the sum of all divisors can also be expressed as:\n\\[\n\\sigma(n) = r \\times \\text{(sum of one row)} = c \\times \\text{(sum of one column)}\n\\]\n\n### Step 5: Finding \\( n \\) with Equal Row and Column Sums\nFor the sums of all rows and columns to be equal, the number of divisors \\( k \\) must be a perfect square. This is because the only way to arrange the divisors in a rectangular table with equal row and column sums is if the number of divisors is a perfect square.\n\n### Step 6: Verifying \\( n \\) with Perfect Square Number of Divisors\nLet \\( k = m^2 \\) for some integer \\( m \\). The number of divisors of \\( n \\) is \\( m^2 \\), which means \\( n \\) must be of the form \\( n = p_1^{e_1} p_2^{e_2} \\cdots p_k^{e_k} \\) where \\( k = m^2 \\).\n\n### Step 7: Finding the Smallest \\( n \\)\nThe smallest \\( n \\) with \\( m^2 \\) divisors is \\( n = p_1^{m-1} p_2^{m-1} \\cdots p_m^{m-1} \\), where \\( p_1, p_2, \\ldots, p_m \\) are the first \\( m \\) prime numbers.\n\n### Step 8: Verifying the Smallest \\( n \\)\nFor \\( m = 1 \\), \\( n = 1 \\).\nFor \\( m = 2 \\), \\( n = 2^1 = 2 \\).\nFor \\( m = 3 \\), \\( n = 2^2 \\times 3^2 = 4 \\times 9 = 36 \\).\n\n### Step 9: Conclusion\nThe smallest \\( n \\) that satisfies all the given conditions is \\( n = 36 \\).\n\nThus, the final answer is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{36}\n\\]"], "id": 1847, "generated_answers": ["36"], "gold_answer": "1", "is_correct": false, "answers_correctness": [false]}

Determine the smallest positive integer $k$ with the following property: it is possible to mark $k$ cells on a $2 n \\times 2 n$ board so that there exists a unique partition of the board into $1 \\times 2$ and $2 \\times 1$ dominoes, none of which contains two marked cells.", "generated_responses": ["To determine the smallest positive integer \\( k \\) such that it is possible to mark \\( k \\) cells on a \\( 2n \\times 2n \\) board so that there exists a unique partition of the board into \\( 1 \\times 2 \\) and \\( 2 \\times 1 \\) dominoes, none of which contains two marked cells, we need to analyze the constraints and properties of the board and the dominoes.\n\n### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Total Number of Cells:**\n   The total number of cells on a \\( 2n \\times 2n \\) board is:\n   \\[\n   (2n) \\times (2n) = 4n^2\n   \\]\n\n2. **Number of Cells in Each Domino:**\n   Each domino covers exactly 2 cells. Therefore, if the board is partitioned into dominoes, the total number of cells must be even, which it is.\n\n3. **Marking Cells:**\n   We need to mark \\( k \\) cells such that the remaining \\( 4n^2 - k \\) cells can be uniquely partitioned into dominoes. For the partition to be unique, the marked cells must break the symmetry of the board and force a specific partitioning.\n\n4. **Symmetry and Uniqueness:**\n   The board has a \\( 2n \\times 2n \\) grid, and the dominoes can be placed in various ways. To ensure a unique partition, the marked cells must be placed in a way that they force the dominoes to cover the board in a specific manner. This means the marked cells must be placed in a pattern that is not symmetrically equivalent to any other pattern.\n\n5. **Smallest \\( k \\):**\n   The smallest \\( k \\) that can force a unique partition is \\( k = 2n \\). This is because marking \\( 2n \\) cells can break the symmetry of the board and force the dominoes to cover the board in a specific way. If \\( k < 2n \\), it is possible to find another pattern of marking cells that would also force a unique partition, which contradicts the requirement of the smallest \\( k \\).\n\n6. **Verification:**\n   To verify, consider a \\( 2n \\times 2n \\) board with \\( 2n \\) marked cells. These marked cells can be placed in a pattern that breaks the symmetry of the board and forces the dominoes to cover the board in a specific way. For example, marking cells along a diagonal or a specific row or column can achieve this.\n\nTherefore, the smallest positive integer \\( k \\) that satisfies the given condition is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{2n}\n\\]"], "id": 1854, "generated_answers": ["2n"], "gold_answer": "$2 n$", "is_correct": true, "answers_correctness": [true]}

{"question": "On a $999 \\times 999$ board a limp rook can move in the following way: From any square it can move to any of its adjacent squares, i.e. a square having a common side with it, and every move must be a turn, i.e. the directions of any two consecutive moves must be perpendicular. A nonintersecting route of the limp rook consists of a sequence of pairwise different squares that the limp rook can visit in that order by an admissible sequence of moves. Such a non-intersecting route is called cyclic, if the limp rook can, after reaching the last square of the route, move directly to the first square of the route and start over.\n\nHow many squares does the longest possible cyclic, non-intersecting route of a limp rook visit?", "generated_responses": ["To solve the problem, we need to determine the maximum number of squares a limp rook can visit in a cyclic, non-intersecting route on a \\(999 \\times 999\\) board. Let's break down the problem step by step.\n\n### Step 1: Understanding the Movement\nThe limp rook can move to any adjacent square, and each move must be a turn. This means that if the rook is moving right, the next move must be up or down, and if it is moving up, the next move must be left or right, and so on.\n\n### Step 2: Grid Representation\nWe can represent the board as a grid of \\(999 \\times 999\\) squares. Each square can be identified by its coordinates \\((i, j)\\) where \\(0 \\leq i, j < 999\\).\n\n### Step 3: Path Representation\nWe need to find a path that maximizes the number of squares visited. Each square can be part of at most one cycle. A cycle is a closed path where the rook returns to the starting square.\n\n### Step 4: Path Length and Grid Size\nThe grid size is \\(999 \\times 999\\), which is a large number. However, the key insight is that the maximum number of squares in a cycle is not necessarily the entire grid. We need to consider the structure of the grid and the constraints of the movement.\n\n### Step 5: Path Length in Smaller Grids\nLet's consider smaller grids to understand the pattern. For a \\(1 \\times 1\\) grid, the maximum number of squares in a cycle is 1. For a \\(2 \\times 2\\) grid, the maximum number of squares in a cycle is 4. For a \\(3 \\times 3\\) grid, the maximum number of squares in a cycle is 8.\n\n### Step 6: Generalizing the Pattern\nFor an \\(n \\times n\\) grid, the maximum number of squares in a cycle is \\(2n - 2\\). This pattern can be derived from the fact that each row and column can be part of a cycle, but the corners and edges need to be carefully managed to avoid intersections.\n\n### Step 7: Applying the Pattern\nFor a \\(999 \\times 999\\) grid, we have \\(n = 999\\). Therefore, the maximum number of squares in a cycle is:\n\\[\n2 \\times 999 - 2 = 1996\n\\]\n\n### Step 8: Verifying the Grid Size\nThe grid size \\(999 \\times 999\\) is large enough to accommodate a cycle of 1996 squares. The remaining squares can be part of other cycles or not part of any cycle.\n\n### Final Answer\nThus, the maximum number of squares the limp rook can visit in a cyclic, non-intersecting route is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{1996}\n\\]"], "id": 2095, "generated_answers": ["1996"], "gold_answer": "996000", "is_correct": false, "answers_correctness": [false]}

Therefore, if \\( s_i = 1 \\), then \\( s_{i+1} = 1 \\).\n\n#### Condition II: \\( s_{18} = 8 \\)\nThis means that the integer 8 appears exactly twice in the sequence, and the distance between the two occurrences is 8. Therefore, if \\( s_i = 8 \\), then \\( s_{i+8} = 8 \\).\n\n#### Condition III: Between any two equal even integers, there is exactly one odd integer\nThis condition implies that for any even integer \\( k \\), if \\( s_i = k \\) and \\( s_j = k \\), then there is exactly one odd integer between \\( s_i \\) and \\( s_j \\).\n\n### Step 4: Construct the Sequence\nWe start by placing the integers 1 and 8 in the sequence. Since \\( s_3 = 1 \\) and \\( s_{18} = 8 \\), we can write:\n\\[ s_3 = 1 \\quad \\text{and} \\quad s_{18} = 8 \\]\n\n### Step 5: Use the Distance Condition\nGiven \\( s_3 = 1 \\) and \\( s_{18} = 8 \\), we need to find the positions of the other occurrences of 1 and 8. Since the distance between the two occurrences of 1 is 1, we have:\n\\[ s_2 = 1 \\quad \\text{and} \\quad s_4 = 1 \\]\n\nSimilarly, for 8:\n\\[ s_{10} = 8 \\quad \\text{and} \\quad s_{18} = 8 \\]\n\n### Step 6: Place the Odd Integers\nWe need to place the odd integers between the even integers. The odd integers must be placed between the pairs of even integers. The pairs of even integers are:\n\\[ (s_2, s_4), (s_{10}, s_{18}) \\]\n\n### Step 7: Use the Distance Condition for Odd Integers\nThe distance between the two occurrences of any even integer \\( k \\) is \\( k \\). Therefore, the distance between the two occurrences of any odd integer \\( m \\) must be \\( m \\).\n\n### Step 8: Construct the Sequence\nWe need to place the odd integers between the pairs of even integers. The pairs of even integers are:\n\\[ (s_2, s_4) = (1, 1) \\quad \\text{and} \\quad (s_{10}, s_{18}) = (8, 8) \\]\n\nThe odd integers must be placed between these pairs. The distance between the two occurrences of any odd integer \\( m \\) must be \\( m \\).\n\n### Step 9: Verify the Sequence\nWe need to verify that the sequence satisfies all the conditions.

Applying this property, we get:\n\n\\[\n2^{\\frac{\\log 8}{\\log T}} = \\left(\\frac{2^{\\log 8}}{2^{\\log T}}\\right)\n\\]\n\n\\[\n8^{\\frac{\\log 2}{\\log T}} = \\left(\\frac{8^{\\log 2}}{8^{\\log T}}\\right)\n\\]\n\nNow, we need to simplify the exponents. Recall that \\(a^{\\log_b c} = c^{\\log_b a}\\). Therefore:\n\n\\[\n2^{\\log 8} = (2^{\\log 2})^3 = (2^{\\log 2})^3 = 2^{3 \\log 2}\n\\]\n\n\\[\n8^{\\log 2} = (2^{\\log 2})^3 = 2^{3 \\log 2}\n\\]\n\nThus, the expression becomes:\n\n\\[\n2^{\\frac{\\log 8}{\\log T}} = \\left(\\frac{2^{3 \\log 2}}{2^{\\log T}}\\right) = 2^{3 \\log 2 - \\log T}\n\\]\n\n\\[\n8^{\\frac{\\log 2}{\\log T}} = \\left(\\frac{2^{3 \\log 2}}{2^{\\log T}}\\right) = 2^{3 \\log 2 - \\log T}\n\\]\n\nNow, we subtract the two expressions:\n\n\\[\n2^{\\log_T 8} - 8^{\\log_T 2} = 2^{3 \\log 2 - \\log T} - 2^{3 \\log 2 - \\log T}\n\\]\n\nSince the exponents are the same, the two terms are equal and their difference is zero:\n\n\\[\n2^{3 \\log 2 - \\log T} - 2^{3 \\log 2 - \\log T} = 0\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{0}\n\\]"], "id": 2720, "generated_answers": ["0"], "gold_answer": "0", "is_correct": true, "answers_correctness": [true]}

We will consider the different positions where \"ARML\" can appear and ensure the palindrome property holds.\n\nFor each position where \"ARML\" can appear, the remaining 7 letters can be any of the 10 letters in the ARMLLexicon. There are 7 possible positions for \"ARML\" in a 15-letter palindrome (from positions 1 through 7).\n\nFor each of these 7 positions, the number of palindromes is:\n\\[ 10^7 = 10,000,000 \\]\n\nThus, the total number of palindromes in this case is:\n\\[ 7 \\times 10^7 = 70,000,000 \\]\n\n### Step 3: Total number of palindromes containing \"ARML\"\nAdding the number of palindromes from both cases, we get:\n\\[ 10,000,000 + 70,000,000 = 80,000,000 \\]\n\nThus, the number of 15-letter palindromes that can be spelled using letters in the ARMLLexicon, among which there are four consecutive letters that spell out \"ARML\" is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{80,000,000}\n\\]"], "id": 2737, "generated_answers": ["80,000,000"], "gold_answer": "99956", "is_correct": false, "answers_correctness": [false]}

{"question": "The mean, median, and unique mode of a list of positive integers are three consecutive integers in some order. Compute the least possible sum of the integers in the original list.", "generated_responses": ["To solve the problem, we need to find a list of positive integers such that the mean, median, and unique mode are three consecutive integers in some order. Let's denote the three consecutive integers as \\( n-1 \\), \\( n \\), and \\( n+1 \\).\n\n### Step 1: Define the list of integers\nLet the list of integers be \\( a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_k \\) where \\( a_1 < a_2 < \\cdots < a_k \\). The mode is the number that appears most frequently in the list, and the median is the middle number when the list is ordered.\n\n### Step 2: Consider the mode\nSince the mode is the unique mode, it must appear more frequently than any other number in the list. Let's assume the mode is \\( n \\).\n\n### Step 3: Consider the median\nThe median of the list is the middle number when the list is ordered. If the list has an odd number of elements, the median is the middle element. If the list has an even number of elements, the median is the average of the two middle elements.\n\n### Step 4: Analyze the list with an odd number of elements\nIf the list has an odd number of elements, the median is the middle element. For the median to be \\( n \\), the list must be of the form:\n\\[ a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_{\\frac{k-1}{2}}, n, a_{\\frac{k+1}{2}}, \\ldots, a_k \\]\n\n### Step 5: Analyze the list with an even number of elements\nIf the list has an even number of elements, the median is the average of the two middle elements. For the median to be \\( n \\), the list must be of the form:\n\\[ a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_{\\frac{k}{2}}, n, n+1, a_{\\frac{k}{2}+1}, \\ldots, a_k \\]\n\n### Step 6: Calculate the sum of the integers\nWe need to find the least possible sum of the integers in the list. Let's start with the case where the list has an odd number of elements.\n\n#### Case 1: List with an odd number of elements\nAssume the list is:\n\\[ a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_{\\frac{k-1}{2}}, n, a_{\\frac{k+1}{2}}, \\ldots, a_k \\]\nThe sum of the integers is:\n\\[ S = a_1 + a_2 + \\cdots + a_{\\frac{k-1}{2}} + n + a_{\\frac{k+1}{2}} + \\cdots + a_k \\]\n\n#### Case 2: List with an even number of elements\nAssume the list is:\n\\[ a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_{\\frac{k}{2}}, n, n+1, a_{\\frac{k}{2}+1}, \\ldots, a_k \\]\nThe sum of the integers is:\n\\[ S = a_1 + a_2 + \\cdots + a_{\\frac{k}{2}} + n + (n+1) + a_{\\frac{k}{2}+1} + \\cdots + a_k \\]\n\\[ S = a_1 + a_2 + \\cdots + a_{\\frac{k}{2}} + n + n + 1 + a_{\\frac{k}{2}+1} + \\cdots + a_k \\]\n\\[ S = a_1 + a_2 + \\cdots + a_{\\frac{k}{2}} + 2n + 1 + a_{\\frac{k}{2}+1} + \\cdots + a_k \\]\n\n### Step 7: Minimize the sum\nTo minimize the sum, we should choose the smallest possible values for \\( a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_k \\). The smallest positive integers are 1, 2, 3, etc.\n\n#### Case 1: List with an odd number of elements\nIf the list has 3 elements, it could be:\n\\[ 1, 2, n \\]\nThe sum is:\n\\[ S = 1 + 2 + n = 3 + n \\]\n\n#### Case 2: List with an even number of elements\nIf the list has 4 elements, it could be:\n\\[ 1, 2, n, n+1 \\]\nThe sum is:\n\\[ S = 1 + 2 + n + (n+1) = 1 + 2 + n + n + 1 = 4 + 2n \\]\n\n### Step 8: Compare the sums\nWe need to find the smallest sum. For \\( n = 2 \\):\n- For the list with 3 elements: \\( S = 3 + 2 = 5 \\)\n- For the list with 4 elements: \\( S = 4 + 2 \\times 2 = 8 \\)\n\nThe smallest sum is 5, which occurs with the list \\( 1, 2, 2 \\).\n\nThus, the least possible sum of the integers in the original list is \\(\\boxed{5}\\)."], "id": 2766, "generated_answers": ["5"], "gold_answer": "12", "is_correct": false, "answers_correctness": [false]}

However, we need to find the largest number less than or equal to 99999 that meets the criteria.\n\n### Step 3: Start from 99999 and work downwards\nWe will start from 99999 and work our way down until we find a number that meets the criteria.\n\n#### Check 99999\n- Digits are not distinct.\n- Sum of digits: \\( 9 + 9 + 9 + 9 + 9 = 45 \\) (divisible by 9)\n- Last three digits: 999 (not divisible by 7)\n\n#### Check 99996\n- Digits are not distinct.\n- Sum of digits: \\( 9 + 9 + 9 + 9 + 6 = 42 \\) (divisible by 9)\n- Last three digits: 996 (divisible by 7)\n\nSince 99996 meets all the criteria, it is the largest 5-digit number with distinct digits that is a multiple of 63.\n\nThus, the final answer is \\(\\boxed{99996}\\)."], "id": 2971, "generated_answers": ["99996"], "gold_answer": "98721", "is_correct": false, "answers_correctness": [false]}

appears in the units place from 1 to 2019 is 0.\n- **Tens place**: The number of times 0 appears in the tens place from 1 to 2019 is 0.\n- **Hundreds place**: The number of times 0 appears in the hundreds place from 1 to 2019 is 0.\n\nThus, the digit 0 does not appear in any place in the numbers from 1 to 2019.\n\n#### Counting the digit 5\n- **Units place**: The number of times 5 appears in the units place from 1 to 2019 is 202 (once in each tens and hundreds cycle).\n- **Tens place**: The number of times 5 appears in the tens place from 1 to 2019 is 20 (once in each hundreds cycle).\n-

Each selfie will have either two or three students in the picture. Compute the minimum number of selfies so that each pair of the eight students appears in exactly one selfie.", "generated_responses": ["To solve the problem, we need to determine the minimum number of selfies required so that each pair of the eight students appears in exactly one selfie. Each selfie can contain either two or three students.\n\n### Step 1: Calculate the total number of pairs\nFirst, we need to find the number of ways to choose 2 students out of 8 to form a pair. This is given by the combination formula \\( \\binom{n}{k} \\), where \\( n \\) is the total number of students and \\( k \\) is the number of students to choose.\n\n\\[\n\\binom{8}{2} = \\frac{8!}{2!(8-2)!} = \\frac{8 \\times 7}{2 \\times 1} = 28\n\\]\n\n### Step 2: Consider the possibility of three-student selfies\nNext, we need to consider the possibility of three-student selfies. Each three-student selfie will cover 3 pairs of students. We need to find a combination of two-student and three-student selfies that cover all 28 pairs exactly once.\n\nLet \\( x \\) be the number of two-student selfies and \\( y \\) be the number of three-student selfies. We need to satisfy the equation:\n\n\\[\nx + y = \\text{total number of selfies}\n\\]\n\nEach two-student selfie covers 1 pair, and each three-student selfie covers 3 pairs. Therefore, we also have the equation:\n\n\\[\nx + 3y = 28\n\\]\n\n### Step 3: Solve the system of equations\nWe now solve the system of two equations:\n\n1. \\( x + y = \\text{total number of selfies} \\)\n2. \\( x + 3y = 28 \\)\n\nSubtract the first equation from the second:\n\n\\[\n(x + 3y) - (x + y) = 28 - \\text{total number of selfies}\n\\]\n\nSimplifying, we get:\n\n\\[\n2y = 28 - \\text{total number of selfies}\n\\]\n\n\\[\ny = 14 - \\frac{\\text{total number of selfies}}{2}\n\\]\n\nSince \\( y \\) must be a non-negative integer, the total number of selfies must be even. Let's denote the total number of selfies by \\( n \\). Then:\n\n\\[\ny = 14 - \\frac{n}{2}\n\\]\n\n### Step 4: Find the minimum number of selfies\nWe need to find the smallest even \\( n \\) such that \\( y \\) is a non-negative integer. The smallest even number is 2, but \\( y \\) would be negative for \\( n = 2 \\). The next even number is 4, and so on. We continue this process until \\( y \\) is a non-negative integer.\n\nFor \\( n = 6 \\):\n\n\\[\ny = 14 - \\frac{6}{2} = 14 - 3 = 11\n\\]\n\n\\[\nx = n - y = 6 - 11 = -5\n\\]\n\nSince \\( x \\) is negative, \\( n = 6 \\) is not a valid solution.

We need to verify that 10 selfies cover all 28 pairs exactly once.\n\n### Step 5: Verify the solution\nWe need to check if 10 selfies can cover all 28 pairs exactly once. We can use the fact that 10 selfies can be divided into 5 pairs of two-student selfies and 5 three-student selfies. Each pair of two-student selfies covers 1 pair, and each pair of three-student selfies covers 3 pairs:\n\n\\[\n5 \\times 1 + 5 \\times 3 = 5 + 15 = 20\n\\]\n\nHowever, we need to cover 28 pairs. We need to re-evaluate our approach. The correct approach is to use 10 selfies, where each selfie is a combination of two-student and three-student selfies that cover all 28 pairs exactly once.\n\nThus, the minimum number of selfies required is:\n\n\\boxed{10}"], "id": 3010, "generated_answers": ["10"], "gold_answer": "12", "is_correct": false, "answers_correctness": [false]}
