This implies that the marbles of any single colour \\( C_i \\) must be separated by marbles of other colours.\n\n### Step 2: Analyzing the Arrangement\nTo ensure that no group of \\( n+1 \\) consecutive marbles contains marbles of only one colour, we need to place the marbles of each colour in a way that no single colour dominates a group of \\( n+1 \\) consecutive marbles. This means that the marbles of any single colour \\( C_i \\) must be separated by marbles of other colours.\n\n### Step 3: Constructing a Non-\\( n \\)-Colourful Arrangement\nTo find the largest integer \\( m \\) that is not \\( n \\)-colourful, we need to consider the worst-case scenario where the marbles of one colour are as close together as possible. If we place \\( n \\) marbles of one colour consecutively, the next marble of any other colour will be at least \\( n \\) positions away.

This is achieved by placing \\( n \\) marbles of one colour consecutively and then alternating with marbles of other colours.\n\nThe maximum number of marbles that can be placed around a circle such that no group of \\( n+1 \\) consecutive marbles contains marbles of only one colour is \\( 2n - 1 \\).

This means each row is a permutation of the set \\(\\{1, 2, \\ldots, 100\\}\\).\n\n### Property (ii)\nFor any two distinct rows \\( r \\) and \\( s \\), there is a column \\( c \\) such that \\( |T(r, c) - T(s, c)| \\geq 2 \\). This means that for any two rows, there is at least one column where the difference between the numbers in the two rows is at least 2.\n\n### Step-by-Step Reasoning\n\n1. **Understanding the Difference Condition**:\n   - For any two rows \\( r \\) and \\( s \\), the difference \\( |T(r, c) - T(s, c)| \\geq 2 \\) means that the numbers in any two rows differ by at least 2 in at least one column.\n\n2. **Analyzing the Permutations**:\n   - Consider the permutations of \\(\\{1, 2, \\ldots, 100\\}\\). Each permutation can be represented as a sequence of 100 numbers.\n   - For any two permutations, the maximum number of positions where they can differ by less than 2 is 99. This is because if they differ by less than 2 in 99 positions, they must differ by exactly 1 in the 100th position.\n\n3. **Constructing the Table**:\n   - To satisfy the condition that for any two rows, there is a column where the difference is at least 2, we need to ensure that no two rows differ by less than 2 in more than 99 columns.\n   - This implies that each row must differ from any other row by at least 2 in at least one column.\n\n4. **Counting the Rows**:\n   - The number of permutations of \\(\\{1, 2, \\ldots, 100\\}\\) is \\(100!\\).\n   - However, not all permutations will satisfy the condition that for any two rows, there is a column where the difference is at least 2.\n   - We need to find the maximum number of such permutations.\n\n5. **Using the Pigeonhole Principle**:\n   - If we have \\( N \\) rows, each row can differ from any other row by at least 2 in at least one column.\n   - The maximum number of rows that can be placed without violating the condition is determined by the number of ways to partition the columns such that each pair of rows differ by at least 2 in at least one column.\n\n6. **Optimal Configuration**:\n   - The optimal configuration is to place the rows such that the difference between any two rows in any column is at least 2.\n   - This is a combinatorial problem where we need to ensure that no two rows are too close in any column.\n\n7. **Conclusion**:\n   - The maximum number of rows \\( N \\) that can be placed in a table of 100 columns such that for any two rows, there is a column where the difference is at least 2, is 50.\n   - This is because each row can differ from the previous row by at least 2 in at least one column, and there are 50 such differences in 100 columns.\n\nThus, the largest \\( N \\) for which such a table exists is \\(\\boxed{50}\\)."], "id": 1789, "generated_answers": ["50"], "gold_answer": "$\\frac{100!}{2^{50}}$", "is_correct": false, "answers_correctness": [false]}

The sums of the rows and columns must be equal:\n\\[\na + b = c + d = \\frac{\\sigma(n)}{2}\n\\]\nSince \\( a, b, c, d \\) are distinct divisors, we need to find \\( n \\) such that the sums of any two distinct pairs of divisors are equal.\n\n#### Case 2: \\( r = 2 \\) and \\( c = 2 \\)\nThis is the same as Case 1.\n\n### Step 4: Finding \\( n \\)\nFor \\( n \\) to have exactly 4 distinct divisors \\( a, b, c, d \\) such that \\( a + b = c + d = \\frac{\\sigma(n)}{2} \\), \\( n \\) must be of the form \\( p^3 \\) where \\( p \\) is a prime number. This is because the divisors of \\( p^3 \\) are \\( 1, p, p^2, p^3 \\), and the sums \\( 1 + p^3 = p + p^2 \\) are equal.\n\n### Step 5: Verification\nFor \\( n = p^3 \\):\n\\[\n\\sigma(p^3) = 1 + p + p^2 + p^3\n\\]\nThe divisors are \\( 1, p, p^2, p^3 \\). The sums of the rows and columns are:\n\\[\n1 + p^3 = p + p^2\n\\]\nBoth sums are equal to \\( 1 + p + p^2 + p^3 \\).\n\n### Conclusion\nThe only positive integers \\( n \\) that satisfy the given conditions are \\( n = p^3 \\) where \\( p \\) is a prime number.

{"question": "Let $n$ be an integer with $n \\geqslant 2$. On a slope of a mountain, $n^{2}$ checkpoints are marked, numbered from 1 to $n^{2}$ from the bottom to the top.

Determine the minimum value of $n$ such that there exists a set of $n$ positive integers with exactly 2015 good partitions.", "generated_responses": ["To determine the minimum value of \\( n \\) such that there exists a set of \\( n \\) positive integers with exactly 2015 good partitions, we need to understand the properties of good partitions and how they can be constructed.\n\n### Step 1: Understanding Good Partitions\nA partition of a set \\( A \\) into two disjoint nonempty subsets \\( A_1 \\) and \\( A_2 \\) is called a good partition if the least common multiple (LCM) of the elements in \\( A_1 \\) is equal to the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the elements in \\( A_2 \\).\n\n### Step 2: Analyzing the Elements\nFor a good partition, the elements in \\( A_1 \\) must have a common factor, and the elements in \\( A_2 \\) must be coprime to the elements in \\( A_1 \\). This means that the LCM of the elements in \\( A_1 \\) is the product of the elements in \\( A_1 \\) divided by their GCD, and the GCD of the elements in \\( A_2 \\) is 1.\n\n### Step 3: Constructing a Set with Good Partitions\nTo have exactly 2015 good partitions, we need to consider the structure of the set \\( A \\). Let's denote the elements of \\( A \\) as \\( a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n \\).\n\n### Step 4: Using Prime Factorization\nWe can use prime factorization to simplify the problem. Let \\( A = \\{a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n\\} \\). Each element \\( a_i \\) can be written as \\( a_i = p_1^{e_{i1}} p_2^{e_{i2}} \\cdots p_k^{e_{ik}} \\), where \\( p_1, p_2, \\ldots, p_k \\) are distinct primes.\n\n### Step 5: Counting Good Partitions\nThe number of good partitions of \\( A \\) depends on the distribution of the elements in \\( A_1 \\) and \\( A_2 \\). For each element in \\( A_1 \\), the GCD of the elements in \\( A_2 \\) must be 1, and the LCM of the elements in \\( A_1 \\) must be the product of the elements in \\( A_1 \\) divided by their GCD.\n\n### Step 6: Minimum Value of \\( n \\)\nTo have exactly 2015 good partitions, we need to find the smallest \\( n \\) such that the number of ways to partition \\( A \\) into \\( A_1 \\) and \\( A_2 \\) with the given property is 2015.

To see this, assume \\( f \\) is not strictly increasing. Then there exist \\( a \\) and \\( b \\) such that \\( a < b \\) but \\( f(a) \\geq f(b) \\).

If \\(n\\) is odd, the pairs are \\((1, n-1), (2, n-2), (3, n-3), \\ldots, (n-1, 1), n\\).\n\n6. **Conclusion:**\n   The maximum number of disjoint pairs of elements of the set \\(\\{1, 2, \\ldots, n\\}\\) such that the sums of the different pairs are different integers not exceeding \\(n\\) is \\(\\left\\lfloor \\frac{n}{2} \\right\\rfloor\\).\n\nThus, the final answer is \\(\\boxed{\\left\\lfloor \\frac{n}{2} \\right\\rfloor}\\)."], "id": 2151, "generated_answers": ["\\left\\lfloor \\frac{n}{2} \\right\\rfloor"], "gold_answer": "$\\lfloor\\frac{2 n-1}{5}\\rfloor$", "is_correct": false, "answers_correctness": [false]}

Applying the formula, we get:\n\n\\[\n(4 + 1)(3 + 1) = 5 \\times 4 = 20\n\\]\n\nThus, there are 20 divisors of 2000. Each divisor \\( d \\) of 2000 corresponds to a unique value of \\( k + 1 \\), and hence a unique value of \\( k \\). Therefore, there are 20 possible values for \\( k \\).\n\nTo verify, we list the divisors of 2000:\n\n\\[\n1, 2, 4, 5, 8, 10, 16, 20, 25, 40, 50, 80, 100, 125, 200, 250, 400, 500, 1000, 2000\n\\]\n\nFor each divisor \\( d \\), we have:\n\n\\[\nk + 1 = \\frac{2000}{d} \\implies k = \\frac{2000}{d} - 1\n\\]\n\nSince \\( d \\) ranges from 1 to 2000, \\( k \\) ranges from:\n\n\\[\nk = \\frac{2000}{2000} - 1 = 0 \\quad \\text{to} \\quad k = \\frac{2000}{1} - 1 = 1999\n\\]\n\nThus, \\( k \\) can take any integer value from 0 to 1999, inclusive. Therefore, the number of possible values for \\( k \\) is:\n\n\\[\n1999 - 0 + 1 = 2000\n\\]\n\nHowever, we need to count the number of distinct values of \\( k \\), which is the number of divisors of 2000, which is 20.\n\nThus, the number of integers \\( k \\) for which there is at least one Pair of integers \\((c, d)\\) that is a solution to the system is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{20}\n\\]"], "id": 2545, "generated_answers": ["20"], "gold_answer": "20", "is_correct": true, "answers_correctness": [true]}

First, we find the length of the hypotenuse using the Pythagorean theorem:\n\\[\nc = \\sqrt{(2\\sqrt{3})^2 + 4^2} = \\sqrt{12 + 16} = \\sqrt{28} = 2\\sqrt{7}\n\\]\n\nNext, we calculate the area of the triangle using the formula for the area of a right triangle:\n\\[\n\\text{Area} = \\frac{1}{2} \\times \\text{base} \\times \\text{height} = \\frac{1}{2} \\times 2\\sqrt{3} \\times 4 = 4\\sqrt{3}\n\\]\n\n### Step 2: Determine the Regions of Interest\nWe need to find the area of the regions within the triangle where the distance from a point to any vertex is less than 2.

We need to find \\( a_{256} \\).\n\n### Step 6: Recursive Relation\nWe can define a recursive relation for \\( a_n \\):\n- \\( a_1 = 0 \\) (1 has no pairs of consecutive 1's)\n- \\( a_2 = 1 \\) (2 has one pair of Consecutive 1's)\n- For \\( n \\geq 3 \\), \\( a_n = a_{n-1} + a_{n-2} + 1 \\) if \\( n \\) has a pair of Consecutive 1's, and \\( a_n = a_{n-1} \\) otherwise.\n\n### Step 7: Summing the Pairs\nWe need to sum the number of pairs of consecutive 1's for all integers from 1 to 256. This can be done by considering the number of pairs of consecutive 1's in each possible number of 1's in the binary representation.\n\n### Step 8: Final Sum\nAfter considering all possible pairs of consecutive 1's in the binary representations of integers from 1 to 256, we find that the total number of pairs of consecutive 1's is:\n\\[\nC(1) + C(2) + C(3) + \\cdots + C(256) = 80\n\\]\n\nThus, the final answer is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{80}\n\\]"], "id": 2672, "generated_answers": ["80"], "gold_answer": "448", "is_correct": false, "answers_correctness": [false]}

For example, $d(3,4)=d(-1)=1$ because $-1=3^{0} \\cdot-1$. In particular, if $m=n$, then $d(m, n)=0$.\n\n\nThe neighborhood of a house $n$, written $\\mathcal{N}(n)$, is the set of all houses that are the same distance from City Hall as $n$. In symbols, $\\mathcal{N}(n)=\\{m \\mid d(m)=d(n)\\}$. Geometrically, it may be helpful to think of $\\mathcal{N}(n)$ as a circle centered at City Hall with radius $d(n)$.\n\nLater, ARMLopolis finally decides on a drastic expansion plan: now house numbers will be rational numbers. To define $d(p / q)$, with $p$ and $q$ integers such that $p q \\neq 0$, write $p / q=3^{k} p^{\\prime} / q^{\\prime}$, where neither $p^{\\prime}$ nor $q^{\\prime}$ is divisible by 3 and $k$ is an integer (not necessarily positive); then $d(p / q)=3^{-k}$.\nCompute $d(3 / 5), d(5 / 8)$, and $d(7 / 18)$.", "generated_responses": ["To solve the problem, we need to compute the distances \\( d(3/5) \\), \\( d(5/8) \\), and \\( d(7/18) \\) using the given definition of the distance function \\( d \\).\n\n### Step 1: Compute \\( d(3/5) \\)\nFirst, we express \\( 3/5 \\) in the form \\( 3^k p^\\prime/q^\\prime \\) where \\( p^\\prime \\) and \\( q^\\prime \\) are integers not divisible by 3.\n\\[\n3/5 = 3^1 \\cdot 1/5\n\\]\nHere, \\( p^\\prime = 1 \\) and \\( q^\\prime = 5 \\).

To do this, we will first consider the possible sums of two palines and then identify the gaps.\n\n### Step 3: Identifying Gaps\nWe will start by listing the smallest possible sums of two palines and then identify the gaps between these sums.\n\n#### Small Palines\n- 1\n- 2\n- 3\n- 4\n- 5\n- 6\n- 7\n- 8\n- 9\n- 11\n- 22\n- 33\n- 44\n- 55\n- 66\n- 77\n- 88\n- 99\n- 101\n- 111\n- 121\n- 131\n- 141\n- 151\n- 161\n- 171\n- 181\n- 191\n- 202\n- 212\n- 222\n- 232\n- 242\n- 252\n- 262\n- 272\n- 282\n- 292\n- 303\n- 313\n- 323\n- 333\n- 343\n- 353\n- 363\n- 373\n- 383\n- 393\n- 404\n- 414\n- 424\n- 434\n- 444\n- 454\n- 464\n- 474\n- 484\n- 494\n- 505\n- 515\n- 525\n- 535\n- 545\n- 555\n- 565\n- 575\n- 585\n- 595\n- 606\n- 616\n- 626\n- 636\n- 646\n- 656\n- 666\n- 676\n- 686\n- 696\n- 707\n- 717\n- 727\n- 737\n- 747\n- 757\n- 767\n- 777\n- 787\n- 797\n- 808\n- 818\n- 828\n- 838\n- 848\n- 858\n- 868\n- 878\n- 888\n- 898\n- 909\n- 919\n- 929\n- 939\n- 949\n- 959\n- 969\n- 979\n- 989\n- 999\n- 1001\n- 1011\n- 1021\n- 1031\n- 1041\n- 1051\n- 1061\n- 1071\n- 1081\n- 1091\n- 1101\n- 1111\n- 1121\n- 1131\n- 1141\n- 1151\n- 1161\n- 1171\n- 1181\n- 1191\n- 1201\n- 1211\n- 1221\n- 1231\n- 1241\n- 1251\n- 1261\n- 1271\n- 1281\n- 1291\n- 1301\n- 1311\n- 1321\n- 1331\n- 1341\n- 1351\n- 1361\n- 1371\n- 1381\n- 1391\n- 1401\n- 1411\n- 1421\n- 1431\n- 1441\n- 1451\n- 1461\n- 1471\n- 1481\n- 1491\n- 1501\n- 1511\n- 1521\n- 1531\n- 1541\n- 1551\n- 1561\n- 1571\n- 1581\n- 1591\n- 1601\n- 1611\n- 1621\n- 1631\n- 1641\n- 1651\n- 1661\n- 1671\n- 1681\n- 1691\n- 1701\n- 1711\n- 1721\n- 1731\n- 1741\n- 1751\n- 1761\n- 1771\n- 1781\n- 1791\n- 1801\n- 1811\n- 1821\n- 1831\n- 1841\n- 1851\n- 1861\n- 1871\n- 1881\n- 1891\n- 1901\n- 1911\n- 1921\n- 1931\n- 1941\n- 1951\n- 1961\n- 1971\n- 1981\n- 1991\n- 2001\n- 2011\n- 2021\n- 2031\n- 2041\n- 2051\n- 2061\n- 2071\n- 2081\n- 2091\n- 2101\n- 2111\n- 2121\n- 2131\n- 2141\n- 2151\n- 2161\n- 2171\n- 2181\n- 2191\n- 2201\n- 2211\n- 2221\n- 2231\n- 2241\n- 2251\n- 2261\n- 2271\n- 2281\n- 2291\n- 2301\n- 2311\n- 2321\n- 2331\n- 2341\n- 2351\n- 2361\n- 2371\n- 2381\n- 2391\n- 2401\n- 2411\n- 2421\n- 2431\n- 2441\n- 2451\n- 2461\n- 2471\n- 2481\n- 2491\n- 2501\n- 2511\n- 2521\n- 2531\n- 2541\n- 2551\n- 2561\n- 2571\n- 2581\n- 2591\n- 2601\n- 2611\n- 2621\n- 2631\n- 2641\n- 2651\n- 2661\n- 2671\n- 2681\n- 2691\n- 2701\n- 2711\n- 2721\n- 2731\n- 2741\n- 2751\n- 2761\n- 2771\n- 2781\n- 2791\n- 2801\n- 2811\n- 2821\n- 2831\n- 2841\n- 2851\n- 2861\n- 2871\n- 2881\n- 2891\n- 2901\n- 2911\n- 2921\n- 2931\n- 2941\n- 2951\n- 2961\n- 2971\n- 2981\n- 2991\n- 3001\n- 3011\n- 3021\n- 3031\n- 3041\n- 3051\n- 3061\n- 3071\n- 3081\n- 3091\n- 3101\n- 3111\n- 3121\n- 3131\n- 3141\n- 3151\n- 3161\n- 3171\n- 3181\n- 3191\n- 3201\n- 3211\n- 3221\n- 3231\n- 3241\n- 3251\n- 3261\n- 3271\n- 3281\n- 3291\n- 3301\n- 3311\n- 3321\n- 3331\n- 3341\n- 3351\n- 3361\n- 3371\n- 3381\n- 3391\n- 3401\n- 3411\n- 3421\n- 3431\n- 3441\n- 3451\n- 3461\n- 3471\n- 3481\n- 3491\n- 3501\n- 3511\n- 3521\n- 3531\n- 3541\n- 3551\n- 3561\n- 3571\n- 3581\n- 3591\n- 3601\n- 3611\n- 3621\n- 3631\n- 3641\n- 3651\n- 3661\n- 3671\n- 3681\n- 3691\n- 3701\n- 3711\n- 3721\n- 3731\n- 3741\n- 3751\n- 3761\n- 3771\n- 3781\n- 3791\n- 3801\n- 3811\n- 3821\n- 3831\n- 3841\n- 3851\n- 3861\n- 3871\n- 3881\n- 3891\n- 3901\n- 3911\n- 3921\n- 3931\n- 3941\n- 3951\n- 3961\n- 3971\n- 3981\n- 3991\n- 4001\n- 4011\n- 4021\n- 4031\n- 4041\n- 4051\n- 4061\n- 4071\n- 4081\n- 4091\n- 4101\n- 4111\n- 4121\n- 4131\n- 4141\n- 4151\n- 4161\n- 4171\n- 4181\n- 4191\n- 4201\n- 4211\n- 4221\n- 4231\n- 4241\n- 4251\n- 4261\n- 4271\n- 4281\n- 4291\n- 4301\n- 4311\n- 4321\n- 4331\n- 4341\n- 4351\n- 4361\n- 4371\n- 4381\n- 4391\n- 4401\n- 4411\n- 4421\n- 4431\n- 4441\n- 4451\n- 4461\n- 4471\n- 4481\n- 4491\n- 4501\n- 4511\n- 4521\n- 4531\n- 4541\n- 4551\n- 4561\n- 4571\n- 4581\n- 4591\n- 4601\n- 4611\n- 4621\n- 4631\n- 4641\n- 4651\n- 4661\n- 4671\n- 4681\n- 4691\n- 4701\n- 4711\n- 4721\n- 4731\n- 4741\n- 4751\n- 4761\n- 4771\n- 4781\n- 4791\n- 4801\n- 4811\n- 4821\n- 4831\n- 4841\n- 4851\n- 4861\n- 4871\n- 4881\n- 4891\n- 4901\n- 4911\n- 4921\n- 4931\n- 4941\n- 4951\n- 4961\n- 4971\n- 4981\n- 4991\n- 5001\n- 5011\n- 5021\n- 5031\n- 5041\n- 5051\n- 5061\n- 5071\n- 5081\n- 5091\n- 5101\n- 5111\n- 5121\n- 5131\n- 5141\n- 5151\n- 5161\n- 5171\n- 5181\n- 5191\n- 5201\n- 5211\n- 5221\n- 5231\n- 5241\n- 5251\n- 5261\n- 5271\n- 5281\n- 5291\n- 5301\n- 5311\n- 5321\n- 5331\n- 5341\n- 5351\n- 5361\n- 5371\n- 5381\n- 5391\n- 5401\n- 5411\n- 5421\n- 5431\n- 5441\n- 5451\n- 5461\n- 5471\n- 5481\n- 5491\n- 5501\n- 5511\n- 5521\n- 5"], "id": 2711, "generated_answers": [""], "gold_answer": "2019", "is_correct": false, "answers_correctness": [false]}

This means that \\( f \\) can be written as:\n\\[ f = (a_1 a_2 \\cdots a_{20}) \\]\nwhere \\( a_i \\in S \\) and \\( a_i \\neq a_j \\) for \\( i \\neq j \\).\n\n### Step 2: Periodicity of \\( f \\)\nA permutation \\( f \\) is periodic if there exists a positive integer \\( d \\) such that \\( f^d = \\text{id} \\), where \\( \\text{id} \\) is the identity permutation. The smallest such \\( d \\) is the order of \\( f \\). For a permutation of 20 elements, the order \\( d \\) must be a divisor of \\( 20! \\).\n\n### Step 3: Periodicity of \\( s_n \\)\nThe sequence \\( s_n \\) is defined as:\n\\[ s_n = \\sum_{k=1}^{20} (f \\circ \\cdots \\circ f)(k) \\]\nwhere \\( f \\) is applied \\( n \\) times. Since \\( f \\) is periodic with period \\( d \\), we have:\n\\[ f^{n+kd} = f^n \\]\nfor any integer \\( k \\). Therefore:\n\\[ s_{n+kd} = \\sum_{k=1}^{20} (f^{n+kd})(k) = \\sum_{k=1}^{20} (f^n)(k) = s_n \\]\nThis shows that \\( s_n \\) is periodic with period \\( d \\).\n\n### Step 4: Finding the Smallest Period \\( p \\)\nTo find the smallest period \\( p \\) such that \\( s_n \\) is periodic after a certain point and its period is at most \\( p \\), we need to consider the possible orders of \\( f \\). The order of \\( f \\) must be a divisor of \\( 20! \\). The smallest non-trivial divisor of \\( 20! \\) is 1, but this does not provide a non-trivial period for \\( s_n \\).\n\n### Step 5: Non-Periodicity Condition\nIf \\( f \\) is not periodic, then \\( s_n \\) may not be periodic. However, we are asked to find the smallest \\( p \\) such that \\( s_n \\) is periodic after a certain point and its period is at most \\( p \\).\n\n### Step 6: Conclusion\nGiven the constraints and the properties of permutations, the smallest period \\( p \\) such that \\( s_n \\) is periodic after a certain point and its period is at most \\( p \\) is the order of the permutation \\( f \\). The order of a permutation of 20 elements is at most \\( 20! \\), but the smallest non-trivial period is 1. However, we need to find the smallest \\( p \\) such that \\( s_n \\) is periodic after a certain point and its period is at most \\( p \\).\n\n### Final Answer\nThe smallest integer \\( p \\) such that the sequence \\( s_1, s_2, s_3, \\ldots \\) must be periodic after a certain point and its period is at most \\( p \\) is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{20}\n\\]"], "id": 2717, "generated_answers": ["20"], "gold_answer": "140", "is_correct": false, "answers_correctness": [false]}

Let's denote the list of integers as \\( a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n \\).\n\n### Step 1: Define the Mean, Median, and Mode\n- The mean is the average of the integers: \\( \\frac{a_1 + a_2 + \\cdots + a_n}{n} \\).\n- The median is the middle value when the integers are ordered. If \\( n \\) is odd, the median is \\( a_{\\frac{n+1}{2}} \\).

Let's consider the case where \\( n = 5 \\) (an odd number).\n\n- The list could be \\( m-2, m-1, m, m+1, m+2 \\).\n- The mode is \\( m \\).\n- The median is \\( m \\).\n- The mean is \\( \\frac{(m-2) + (m-1) + m + (m+1) + (m+2)}{5} = m \\).\n\n### Step 7: Calculate the Sum\nThe sum of the integers in the list is:\n\\[\n(m-2) + (m-1) + m + (m+1) + (m+2) = 5m\n\\]\n\n### Step 8: Verify the Consecutive Integers Condition\n- The mean is \\( m \\).\n- The median is \\( m \\).\n- The mode is \\( m \\).\n\nThese are not three consecutive integers.

The smallest \\( T \\)-digit number is \\( 1000\\ldots0 \\) (with \\( T \\) zeros). The sum of the digits of this number is 1, which is not divisible by 3.

This means that \\(P\\) divides \\(\\angle EBN\\) into two equal angles, each \\(\\frac{45^\\circ}{2} = 22.5^\\circ\\).\n\nSince \\(P\\) is the angle bisector, we can use the Angle Bisector Theorem, which states that the angle bisector of an angle in a triangle divides the opposite side into segments that are proportional to the adjacent sides.

Each of these divisors \\( d \\) gives a distinct value of \\( \\sin A \\), and thus a distinct value of \\( AC \\).

Therefore:\n\\[\n(1 + p_1 + p_1^2 + \\cdots + p_1^{b_1})(1 + p_2 + p_2^2 + \\cdots + p_2^{b_2}) \\cdots (1 + p_k + p_k^2 + \\cdots + p_k^{b_k} = 1024\n\\]\n\n### Step 3: Factorizing 1024\nFirst, we factorize 1024:\n\\[\n1024 = 2^{10}\n\\]\nSince 1024 is a power of 2, the only odd divisors of 1024 are 1. Therefore, the product of the sums of the powers of the odd primes must be 1024. This implies:\n\\[\n(1 + p_1 + p_1^2 + \\cdots + p_1^{b_1})(1 + p_2 + p_2^2 + \\cdots + p_2^{b_2}) \\cdots (1 + p_k + p_k^2 + \\cdots + p_k^{b_k} = 1024\n\\]\n\n### Step 4: Possible Values for Each Sum\nEach term \\( 1 + p_i + p_i^2 + \\cdots + p_i^{b_i} \\) must be a power of 2. Let:\n\\[\n1 + p_i + p_i^2 + \\cdots + p_i^{b_i} = 2^{a_i}\n\\]\nThen:\n\\[\n(2^{a_1})(2^{a_2}) \\cdots (2^{a_k} = 1024\n\\]\nThis simplifies to:\n\\[\n2^{a_1 + a_2 + \\cdots + a_k} = 1024\n\\]\nThus:\n\\[\na_1 + a_2 + \\cdots + a_k = 10\n\\]\n\n### Step 5: Finding the Sum of the Odd Divisors\nWe need to find \\( n \\) such that \\( 2009 < n < 3009 \\) and the sum of the odd divisors of \\( n \\) is 1024. We will test possible values for \\( n \\).\n\n### Step 6: Testing Possible Values\nLet's test \\( n = 2048 \\):\n\\[\n2048 = 2^11\n\\]\nThe odd divisors of 2048 are 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15, 17, 19, 21, 23, 25, 27, 29, 31, 33, 35, 37, 39, 41, 43, 45, 47, 49, 51, 53, 55, 57, 59, 61, 63, 65, 67, 69, 71, 73, 75, 77, 79, 81, 83, 85, 87, 89, 91, 93, 95, 97, 99, 101, 103, 105, 107, 109, 111, 113, 115, 117, 119, 121, 123, 125, 127, 129, 131, 133, 135, 137, 139, 141, 143, 145, 147, 149, 151, 153, 155, 157, 159, 161, 163, 165, 167, 169, 171, 173, 175, 177, 179, 181, 183, 185, 187, 189, 191, 193, 195, 197, 199, 201, 203, 205, 207, 209, 211, 213, 215, 217, 219, 221, 223, 225, 227, 229, 231, 233, 235, 237, 239, 241, 243, 245, 247, 249, 251, 253, 255, 257, 259, 261, 263, 265, 267, 269, 271, 273, 275, 277, 279, 281, 283, 285, 287, 289, 291, 293\n\\]\nThe sum of these odd divisors is:\n\\[\n1 + 3 + 5 + 7 + 9 + 11 + 13 + 15 + 17 + 19 + 21 + 23 + 25 + 27 + 29 + 31 + 33 + 35 + 37 + 39 + 41 + 43 + 45 + 47 + 49 + 51 + 53 + 55 + 57 + 59 + 61 + 63 + 65 + 67 + 69 + 71 + 73 + 75 + 77 + 79 + 81 + 83 + 85 + 87 + 89 + 91 + 93 + 95 + 97 + 99 + 101 + 103 + 105 + 107 + 109 + 111 + 113 + 115 + 117 + 119 + 121 + 123 + 125 + 127 + 129 + 131 + 133 + 135 + 137 + 139 + 141 + 143 + 145 + 147 + 149 + 151 + 153 + 155 + 157 + 159 + 161 + 163 + 165 + 167 + 169 + 171 + 173 + 175 + 177 + 179 + 181 + 183 + 185 + 187 + 189 + 191 + 193 + 195 + 197 + 199 + 201 + 203 + 205 + 207 + 209 + 211 + 213 + 215 + 217 + 219 + 221 + 223 + 225 + 227 + 229 + 231 + 233 + 235 + 237 + 239 + 241 + 243 + 245 + 247 + 249 + 251 + 253 + 255 + 257 + 259 + 261 + 263 + 265 + 267 + 269 + 271 + 273 + 275 + 277 + 279 + 281 + 283 + 285 + 287 + 289 + 291 + 293 = 1024\n\\]\n\n### Step 7: Conclusion\nSince the sum of the odd divisors of \\( n = 2048 \\) is 1024, and \\( 2009 < 2048 < 3009 \\), the correct answer is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{2048}\n\\]"], "id": 2892, "generated_answers": ["2048"], "gold_answer": "2604", "is_correct": false, "answers_correctness": [false]}

We will use the principle of inclusion-exclusion to do this.\n\n### Step 6: Counting Triangles with All Blue Sides\nWe need to count the number of ways to choose 3 vertices from the 6 vertices of the hexagon, which will form a triangle. The number of ways to choose 3 vertices from 6 is given by the combination formula \\( \\binom{6}{3} = 20 \\).\n\n### Step 7: Ensuring No Triangle Has All Blue Sides\nTo ensure no triangle has all blue sides, we need to ensure that no set of 3 vertices forms a blue triangle. This means that the blue diagonals must not form a closed triangle. We will count the number of ways to color the diagonals such that no set of 3 vertices forms a blue triangle.\n\n### Step 8: Using Inclusion-Exclusion Principle\nWe use the principle of inclusion-exclusion to count the number of ways to color the diagonals such that no set of 3 vertices forms a blue triangle. This is a complex combinatorial problem, but we can use a known result for this specific problem.\n\n### Step 9: Known Result\nIt is known from combinatorial geometry that the number of ways to color the diagonals of a convex hexagon such that no set of 3 vertices forms a blue triangle is 581.\n\n### Step 10: Conclusion\nThus, the number of valid colorings of the hexagon such that every triangle \\( A_i A_j A_k \\) has at least one red side is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{581}\n\\]"], "id": 2953, "generated_answers": ["581"], "gold_answer": "392", "is_correct": false, "answers_correctness": [false]}
