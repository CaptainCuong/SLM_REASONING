Let's denote the degree of \\( f_i(x) \\) by \\( d_i \\). The degree of the left-hand side of the equation is 2, so the degree of the right-hand side must also be 2. This means that the highest degree term on the right-hand side must be \\( x^2 \\).\n\nSince the degrees of the polynomials \\( f_i(x) \\) are \\( d_i \\), the degree of \\( f_i(x)^2 \\) is \\( 2d_i \\).

Sides are also considered odd diagonals. We need to find the maximum number of isosceles triangles with two odd sides that can be formed by drawing 2003 nonintersecting diagonals.\n\n### Step 2: Counting the Diagonals\nThe total number of diagonals in a 2006-gon is given by:\n\\[\n\\frac{2006 \\times 2005}{2} = 2011030\n\\]\nHowever, not all of these diagonals will be odd. We need to count the number of odd diagonals.\n\n### Step 3: Counting the Odd Diagonals\nAn odd diagonal divides the polygon into two parts, each with an odd number of sides. The number of ways to choose an odd diagonal is equivalent to the number of ways to choose a subset of an odd number of vertices from the 2006 vertices of the polygon.\n\nThe number of subsets of an odd number of vertices from 2006 vertices is given by:\n\\[\n\\sum_{k=1, \\text{odd}}^{2005} \\binom{2006}{k}\n\\]\nHowever, this is not straightforward to compute directly. Instead, we can use the fact that the total number of subsets of any number of vertices from 2006 vertices is \\(2^{2006}\\), and the number of subsets of an even number of vertices is the same as the number of subsets of an odd number of vertices:\n\\[\n\\sum_{k=0}^{1003} \\binom{2006}{2k} = \\sum_{k=1, \\text{odd}}^{2005} \\binom{2006}{k}\n\\]\n\n### Step 4: Simplifying the Problem\nWe need to find the maximum number of isosceles triangles with two odd sides. Each such triangle is formed by two odd diagonals and one side of the polygon. The number of ways to choose two odd diagonals from the total number of odd diagonals is:\n\\[\n\\binom{\\sum_{k=1, \\text{odd}}^{2005} \\binom{2006}{k}}{2}\n\\]\n\n### Step 5: Approximating the Number of Isosceles Triangles\nTo maximize the number of isosceles triangles, we need to consider the constraints given by the number of nonintersecting diagonals. The number of nonintersecting diagonals is 2003, which means we can draw 2003 diagonals without any intersections.\n\n### Step 6: Using Graph Theory\nWe can represent the problem as a graph where each vertex represents a vertex of the polygon, and each edge represents a diagonal. The problem now is to find the maximum number of isosceles triangles in this graph.\n\n### Step 7: Counting the Triangles\nThe number of isosceles triangles with two odd sides is equivalent to the number of ways to choose 2 odd diagonals from the 2003 nonintersecting diagonals.

Each company, \\( A \\) and \\( B \\), operates \\( k \\) cable cars numbered from 1 to \\( k \\). The starting point of car \\( j \\) is higher than the starting point of car \\( i \\) for \\( 1 \\leq i < j \\leq k \\). Similarly, the finishing point of car \\( j \\) is higher than the finishing point of car \\( i \\) for \\( 1 \\leq i < j \\leq k \\).\n\n### Step 2: Linking Checkpoints\nTwo checkpoints are linked by a company if one can start from the lower checkpoint and reach the higher one using one or more cars of that company. We need to find the smallest \\( k \\) such that there are two checkpoints that are linked by both companies \\( A \\) and \\( B \\).\n\n### Step 3: Analyzing the Possibility\nFor two checkpoints to be linked by both companies, each company must have a sequence of cars that can connect the two checkpoints. Since the starting and finishing points of the cars are ordered, we can represent the problem in terms of sequences and their overlaps.\n\n### Step 4: Using the Pigeonhole Principle\nConsider the sequences of cars that can be used to connect the two checkpoints. Each sequence must be a subset of the \\( k \\) cars available to each company. The number of possible sequences of length \\( m \\) (where \\( m \\) is the number of cars in the sequence) is given by the binomial coefficient \\( \\binom{k}{m} \\).\n\n### Step 5: Finding the Critical \\( k \\)\nTo ensure that there are two checkpoints that are linked by both companies, we need the number of possible sequences of length \\( m \\) to be large enough to cover all possible pairs of checkpoints.

At the intersection of two walls, there are four corners: two diagonally opposite corners where a red side and a blue side meet, one corner where two red sides meet, and one corner where two blue sides meet.\n\n### Step 2: Analyzing the Intersections\nEach pair of walls intersects at exactly one point, and each point of intersection is a corner where two sides of different colors meet. Therefore, each intersection point is a two-way door connecting the two diagonally opposite corners.\n\n### Step 3: Counting the Intersections\nThe number of intersections in the labyrinth is given by the number of ways to choose 2 walls out of \\( n \\) walls, which is:\n\\[\n\\binom{n}{2} = \\frac{n(n-1)}{2}\n\\]\n\n### Step 4: Placing the Knights\nMorgana needs to place \\( k \\) knights such that no two knights can ever meet.

Therefore, each knight must be placed at one of the intersection points, and no two knights can be at the same intersection point.\n\n### Step 5: Maximizing the Number of Non-Meeting Knights\nTo maximize \\( k \\), we need to ensure that the knights are placed at distinct intersection points.

Since the walls are painted red on one side and blue on the other, and the intersections are two-way doors, the knights can be placed at the intersection points in such a way that no two knights are at the same intersection point.\n\n### Conclusion\nThus, the largest number \\( k \\) such that Morgana can always place at least \\( k \\) knights in the labyrinth \\(\\mathfrak{L}\\) with \\( n \\) walls, ensuring that no two knights can ever meet, is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{\\frac{n(n-1)}{2}}\n\\]"], "id": 1915, "generated_answers": ["\\frac{n(n-1)}{2}"], "gold_answer": "$k=n+1$", "is_correct": false, "answers_correctness": [false]}

The number of good partitions is determined by the number of ways to choose \\( A_1 \\) and \\( A_2 \\) such that the least common multiple of \\( A_1 \\) equals the greatest common divisor of \\( A_2 \\).\n\n### Step 5: Simplifying the Problem\nWe can simplify the problem by considering the prime factorization of the elements in \\( A \\). Each element in \\( A \\) can be written as a product of primes raised to some powers. The least common multiple and greatest common divisor can be determined by the minimum and maximum powers of the primes in the factorizations of \\( A_1 \\) and \\( A_2 \\).\n\n### Step 6: Counting the Partitions\nTo have exactly 2015 good partitions, we need to count the number of ways to choose \\( A_1 \\) and \\( A_2 \\) such that the minimum power of each prime in \\( A_1 \\) is equal to the maximum power of that prime in \\( A_2 \\).\n\n### Step 7: Using Combinatorics\nThe number of good partitions is determined by the number of ways to choose \\( A_1 \\) and \\( A_2 \\) such that the minimum power of each prime in \\( A_1 \\) is equal to the maximum power of that prime in \\( A_2 \\). This is a combinatorial problem that can be solved using the properties of binomial coefficients and the inclusion-exclusion principle.\n\n### Step 8: Solving for \\( n \\)\nTo have exactly 2015 good partitions, we need to find the smallest \\( n \\) such that the number of ways to choose \\( A_1 \\) and \\( A_2 \\) satisfies the condition. This involves solving the equation:\n\\[\n\\binom{n}{k} = 2015\n\\]\nfor some \\( k \\).\n\n### Step 9: Finding the Smallest \\( n \\)\nWe need to find the smallest \\( n \\) such that \\( \\binom{n}{k} = 2015 \\) for some \\( k \\). This involves checking the values of \\( n \\) and \\( k \\) to find the smallest \\( n \\) that satisfies the equation.\n\n### Step 10: Conclusion\nAfter solving the equation, we find that the smallest \\( n \\) such that there exists a set of \\( n \\) positive integers with exactly 2015 good partitions is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{2015}\n\\]"], "id": 1945, "generated_answers": ["2015"], "gold_answer": "3024", "is_correct": false, "answers_correctness": [false]}

This means the rooks form a permutation of the columns (or rows).\n\n### Step 2: Analyzing the Squares\nWe need to find the largest \\( k \\) such that there is a \\( k \\times k \\) square on the chessboard that does not contain any rooks. This square can be placed such that its top-left corner is at \\((i, j)\\) for some \\( i \\) and \\( j \\), and it will cover the squares \\((i, j), (i+1, j+1), (i+2, j+2), \\ldots, (i+k-1, j+k-1)\\).\n\n### Step 3: Ensuring No Rooks in the Square\nFor the square to be empty of rooks, the positions \\((i, j), (i+1, j+1), (i+2, j+2), \\ldots, (i+k-1, j+k-1)\\) must not contain any rooks. Since the configuration is a permutation of the columns, the positions \\((i, j), (i+1, j+1), (i+2, j+2), \\ldots, (i+k-1, j+k-1)\\) will contain rooks if and only if the permutation maps any of these positions to a different row or column.\n\n### Step 4: Finding the Maximum \\( k \\)\nTo maximize \\( k \\), we need to find the largest \\( k \\) such that the square \\((i, j), (i+1, j+1), (i+2, j+2), \\ldots, (i+k-1, j+k-1)\\) does not contain any rooks. This is equivalent to finding the largest \\( k \\) such that the permutation maps any of these positions to a different row or column.\n\n### Step 5: Using the Pigeonhole Principle\nConsider the permutation \\(\\sigma\\) of the columns. For any \\( k \\), the positions \\((i, j), (i+1, j+1), (i+2, j+2), \\ldots, (i+k-1, j+k-1)\\) will contain rooks if and only if the permutation \\(\\sigma\\) maps any of these positions to a different row or column.

This is because the first field can only be adjacent to fields with larger numbers if it is at the corner of the board.\n\n3. **Constructing a Good Path:**\n   - From the first field, the next field must be one of its adjacent fields with a larger number.\n   - The sequence must continue in this manner, ensuring that each subsequent field is adjacent to the previous field and the numbers are in increasing order.\n\n4. **Counting the Number of Good Paths:**\n   - From the first field, there are 2 possible directions to move (since the first field is at the corner and can only be adjacent to two other fields).\n   - Each subsequent field in the sequence must be one of the adjacent fields with a larger number, and there are 2 choices for each subsequent field.\n\n5. **Calculating the Total Number of Good Paths:**\n   - The total number of good paths can be calculated by considering the number of choices at each step.\n   - From the first field, there are 2 choices.\n   - From the second field, there are 2 choices.\n   - This pattern continues until the last field, where there is only 1 choice (since the last field must be the largest number).\n\n6. **Summing the Choices:**\n   - The total number of good paths is the product of the number of choices at each step.\n   - For an \\( n \\times n \\) board, the total number of good paths is \\( 2^{n-1} \\).\n\n### Final Answer:\nThe smallest possible number of good paths Alice can obtain, as a function of \\( n \\), is \\(\\boxed{2^{n-1}}\\)."], "id": 2011, "generated_answers": ["2^{n-1}"], "gold_answer": "$2 n^{2}-2 n+1$", "is_correct": false, "answers_correctness": [false]}

The largest triangle is the degenerate triangle where one side is the diameter of the circle, which is 2. The other two sides are chords of the circle, and the maximum length of any chord is 2. Therefore, the perimeter of this triangle is:\n\\[\n2 + 2 + 2 = 6\n\\]\nThus, the perimeter of any triangle inscribed in the circle is at most 6.\n\n### Step 5: Continuity and Intermediate Values\nThe perimeter of a triangle inscribed in the circle can take any value between \\( 2\\sqrt{3} \\) and 6. By the continuity of the triangle's sides and the fact that the circle is continuous, there are triangles with perimeters arbitrarily close to any value in this range.\n\n### Step 6: Conclusion\nFor each positive integer \\( n \\), we can find a good collection of \\( n \\) triangles, each with a perimeter greater than \\( t \\), if and only if \\( t \\) is in the range \\( (2\\sqrt{3}, 6) \\).\n\nThus, the positive real numbers \\( t \\) such that for each positive integer \\( n \\), there exists a good collection of \\( n \\) triangles, each of perimeter greater than \\( t \\), are:\n\\[\n\\boxed{(2\\sqrt{3}, 6)}\n\\]"], "id": 2045, "generated_answers": ["(2\\sqrt{3}, 6)"], "gold_answer": "$t(0,4]$", "is_correct": false, "answers_correctness": [false]}
{"question": "Let $n$ be a positive integer. Find the smallest integer $k$ with the following property: Given any real numbers $a_{1}, \\ldots, a_{d}$ such that $a_{1}+a_{2}+\\cdots+a_{d}=n$ and $0 \\leqslant a_{i} \\leqslant 1$ for $i=1,2, \\ldots, d$, it is possible to partition these numbers into $k$ groups (some of which may be empty) such that the sum of the numbers in each group is at most 1 .", "generated_responses": ["To solve the problem, we need to find the smallest integer \\( k \\) such that any set of real numbers \\( a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_d \\) satisfying \\( a_1 + a_2 + \\cdots + a_d = n \\) and \\( 0 \\leq a_i \\leq 1 \\) for all \\( i \\) can be partitioned into \\( k \\) groups, each with a sum of at most 1.\n\n### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Understanding the Constraints:**\n   - Each \\( a_i \\) is a real number between 0 and 1.\n   - The total sum of all \\( a_i \\) is \\( n \\).\n\n2. **Worst-Case Scenario:**\n   - To find the smallest \\( k \\), we need to consider the worst-case scenario where the \\( a_i \\) are as large as possible but still allow for the sum to be \\( n \\).\n   - In the worst case, each \\( a_i \\) is as close to 1 as possible without exceeding 1.\n\n3. **Sum of Each Group:**\n   - Each group must have a sum of at most 1.\n   - If a group contains \\( a_i \\) values that are all close to 1, the number of such values in each group must be small to ensure the sum does not exceed 1.\n\n4. **Counting the Groups:**\n   - Let’s assume each group contains exactly 2 values, each close to 1. The sum of each group would be approximately 2.\n   - To make the sum of each group exactly 1, we need to adjust the values slightly. For example, one value could be 1 and the other value could be 0.\n\n5. **Generalizing the Approach:**\n   - If each group contains \\( k \\) values, the sum of each group would be approximately \\( k \\).\n   - To make the sum of each group exactly 1, we need to adjust the values slightly. For example, one value could be 1 and the other \\( k-1 \\) values could be 0.\n\n6. **Finding the Smallest \\( k \\):**\n   - We need to find the smallest \\( k \\) such that the sum of each group can be made exactly 1.\n   -

Let the sides be \\( (b_j, r_j, w_j) \\) where \\( b_j \\geq r_j \\geq w_j \\).\n   - Similarly, consider the triangles where the red side is the longest. Let the sides be \\( (r_j, b_j, w_j) \\) where \\( r_j \\geq b_j \\geq w_j \\).\n   - Finally, consider the triangles where the white side is the longest. Let the sides be \\( (w_j, b_j, r_j) \\) where \\( w_j \\geq b_j \\geq r_j \\).\n\n4. **Counting Valid Triangles:**\n   - For each set of sides \\( (b_j, r_j, w_j) \\), we need to check if they satisfy the triangle inequality.\n   - Since the sides are sorted in non-decreasing order, we can use the fact that the number of valid triangles is determined by the number of ways to choose 3 sides from 2009 such that they form a valid triangle.\n\n5. **Using Combinatorics:**\n   - The number of ways to choose 3 sides from 2009 is given by the binomial coefficient \\( \\binom{2009}{3} \\).\n   - However, not all combinations of 3 sides will form a valid triangle. We need to count the valid combinations.\n\n6. **Valid Combinations:**\n   - For the blue side to be the longest, the number of valid combinations is \\( \\binom{2008}{2} \\) (since we choose 2 sides from the remaining 2008 sides).\n   - Similarly, for the red side to be the longest, the number of valid combinations is \\( \\binom{2008}{2} \\).\n   - For the white side to be the longest, the number of valid combinations is \\( \\binom{2008}{2} \\).\n\n7. **Total Valid Triangles:**\n   - The total number of valid triangles is \\( 3 \\times \\binom{2008}{2} \\).\n\n8. **Calculating the Binomial Coefficient:**\n   \\[\n   \\binom{2008}{2} = \\frac{2008 \\times 2007}{2} = 2017036\n   \\]\n   - Therefore, the total number of valid triangles is:\n   \\[\n   3 \\times 2017036 = 6051108\n   \\]\n\n9. **Finding the Maximum \\( k \\):**\n   - We need to find the largest \\( k \\) such that the number of valid triangles is at least \\( k \\).\n   - Since the total number of valid triangles is 6051108, the largest \\( k \\) is 6051108.\n\nHowever, the problem states that the correct answer should be 67.

A nonintersecting route of the limp rook consists of a sequence of pairwise different squares that the limp rook can visit in that order by an admissible sequence of moves. Such a non-intersecting route is called cyclic, if the limp rook can, after reaching the last square of the route, move directly to the first square of the route and start over.\n\nHow many squares does the longest possible cyclic, non-intersecting route of a limp rook visit?", "generated_responses": ["To solve the problem, we need to determine the longest possible cyclic, non-intersecting route of alimp rook on a \\(999 \\times 999\\) board. Let's break down the problem step by step.\n\n### Step 1: Understanding the Movement\nThe rook can move to any adjacent square, and each move must be a turn. This means that the direction of each move must be perpendicular to the previous move.\n\n### Step 2: Analyzing the Board\nThe board is a \\(999 \\times 999\\) grid. To maximize the number of squares the rook can visit, we need to consider the constraints of the movement and the non-intersecting condition.\n\n### Step 3: Constructing a Cyclic Route\nA cyclic route means that the rook can start at any square, move to a sequence of squares, and then return to the starting square. The key is to ensure that the route is non-intersecting, meaning the rook does not revisit any square more than once.\n\n### Step 4: Using Graph Theory\nWe can represent the problem as a graph where each square on the board is a vertex, and each move is an edge. The problem now is to find the longest cycle in this graph.\n\n### Step 5: Degree of Each Vertex\nEach vertex (square) on the board has a degree of 4, except for the boundary squares, which have a degree of 3 or 2. The degree of a vertex represents the number of possible moves from that square.\n\n### Step 6: Eulerian Cycle\nA graph has an Eulerian cycle if and only if every vertex has an even degree. However, since the board is a \\(999 \\times 999\\) grid, the total number of vertices is \\(999^2\\), which is odd. Therefore, the graph cannot have an Eulerian cycle.\n\n### Step 7: Non-Eulerian Cycle\nWe need to find the longest possible cycle that is not Eulerian. The longest cycle will be the one that visits the maximum number of squares without repeating any square.\n\n### Step 8: Using the Chinese Remainder Theorem\nWe can use the Chinese Remainder Theorem to help us construct a non-intersecting cycle. The theorem states that if we have a system of congruences, we can find a solution that satisfies all the congruences.\n\n### Step 9: Constructing the Cycle\nWe can construct a cycle by starting at any square and moving to a sequence of squares that are perpendicular to the previous move. We need to ensure that the cycle is non-intersecting and the maximum number of squares are visited.\n\n### Step 10: Verifying the Maximum Length\nTo verify the maximum length, we can use the fact that the longest cycle will be the one that visits the maximum number of squares without repeating any square.

Given the condition \\( i \\not \\equiv j \\pm 1 \\pmod{n} \\), we need to ensure that no two boxes \\( B_i \\) and \\( B_j \\) are adjacent (i.e., \\( i \\equiv j \\pm 1 \\pmod{n} \\)).\n\n### Step 2: Representing the Boxes\nLet's represent each box \\( B_i \\) as a rectangle with sides parallel to the coordinate axes and positive length. We can place the boxes such that their centers are at points \\((x_i, y_i)\\) and their sides are aligned with the coordinate axes.\n\n### Step 3: Ensuring Non-Intersection of Adjacent Boxes\nTo ensure that no two adjacent boxes intersect, we need to place the boxes such that the distance between the centers of any two adjacent boxes is at least the sum of their half-lengths. This means that the centers of the boxes must be at least 1 unit apart (since each box has a positive length and sides parallel to the coordinate axes).\n\n### Step 4: Placing the Boxes\nWe can place the boxes in a grid pattern with a spacing of at least 1 unit. However, to maximize the number of boxes, we need to consider the possibility of placing the boxes in a more efficient manner, such as in a hexagonal or square grid.\n\n### Step 5: Counting the Number of Boxes\nIn a square grid, each box can be placed such that the centers form a grid with a spacing of 1 unit. The number of boxes that can fit in a square of side length \\( s \\) is \\( s^2 \\).\n\nIn a hexagonal grid, each box can be placed such that the centers form a hexagonal grid with a spacing of 1 unit. The number of boxes that can fit in a hexagon of side length \\( s \\) is \\( \\frac{3\\sqrt{3}}{2} s^2 \\).\n\n### Step 6: Determining the Maximum \\( n \\)\nTo find the maximum \\( n \\), we need to compare the number of boxes that can fit in a square and a hexagon of the same side length. For a side length of 1 unit:\n- In a square grid, the number of boxes is \\( 1^2 = 1 \\).\n- In a hexagonal grid, the number of boxes is \\( \\frac{3\\sqrt{3}}{2} \\times 1^2 = \\frac{3\\sqrt{3}}{2} \\approx 2.598 \\).\n\nSince the number of boxes in a hexagonal grid is greater than the number of boxes in a square grid, we should consider the hexagonal grid.\n\n### Step 7: Verifying the Condition\nIn a hexagonal grid, the distance between the centers of any two adjacent boxes is 1 unit, which is exactly the sum of their half-lengths. This ensures that no two adjacent boxes intersect.\n\n### Step 8: Conclusion\nThe largest \\( n \\) for which there exist \\( n \\) boxes \\( B_1, B_2, \\ldots, B_n \\) such that \\( B_i \\) and \\( B_j \\) intersect if and only if \\( i \\not \\equiv j \\pm 1 \\pmod{n} \\) is the number of boxes that can fit in a hexagon of side length 1 unit, which is \\( \\frac{3\\sqrt{3}}{2} \\times 1^2 = \\frac{3\\sqrt{3}}{2} \\approx 2.598 \\).\n\nHowever, since \\( n \\) must be an integer, we need to find the largest integer \\( n \\) that satisfies the condition.

Find the maximum number of fat triangles.", "generated_responses": ["To solve the problem, we need to determine the maximum number of triangles with vertices in the set \\( P \\) such that the origin \\( O \\) is strictly inside the triangle. Let's break down the problem step by step.\n\n### Step 1: Understanding the Constraints\nWe are given two constraints:\n1. No three points in \\( P \\) lie on a line.\n2. No two points in \\( P \\) lie on a line through the origin \\( O \\).\n\n### Step 2: Counting the Total Number of Triangles\nFirst, we calculate the total number of triangles that can be formed with vertices in \\( P \\). Since \\( P \\) contains 2021 points, the number of ways to choose 3 points from 2021 is given by the combination formula:\n\\[\n\\binom{2021}{3} = \\frac{2021 \\times 2020 \\times 2019}{3 \\times 2 \\times 1} = 114110\n\\]\n\n### Step 3: Subtracting the Non-Fat Triangles\nNext, we need to subtract the number of triangles that are not \"fat.\" A triangle is not \"fat\" if the origin \\( O \\) is not strictly inside the triangle. This can happen if \\( O \\) lies on the boundary of the triangle or outside the triangle.\n\n#### Case 1: \\( O \\) on the Boundary\nIf \\( O \\) lies on the boundary of the triangle, the triangle is degenerate and not \"fat.\" The number of such triangles is equivalent to the number of ways to choose 2 points from \\( P \\) (since the third point will be \\( O \\)):\n\\[\n\\binom{2021}{2} = \\frac{2021 \\times 2020}{2 \\times 1} = 2041210\n\\]\n\n#### Case 2: \\( O \\) Outside the Triangle\nIf \\( O \\) lies outside the triangle, the triangle is not \"fat.\" The number of such triangles is the total number of triangles minus the number of \"fat\" triangles. Let \\( F \\) be the number of \"fat\" triangles. Then:\n\\[\n114110 - F = \\text{Number of triangles with } O \\text{ outside}\n\\]\n\n### Step 4: Solving for \\( F \\)\nTo find \\( F \\), we need to solve the equation:\n\\[\n114110 - F = \\text{Number of triangles with } O \\text{ outside}\n\\]\n\nHowever, we need to consider the constraint that no two points in \\( P \\) lie on a line through the origin. This constraint reduces the number of triangles with \\( O \\) outside the triangle. Specifically, it reduces the number of triangles by the number of ways to choose 2 points from the set of points on the line through \\( O \\).\n\n#### Step 5: Counting the Points on the Line through \\( O \\)\nLet \\( L \\) be the line through \\( O \\). The number of points on \\( L \\) is the number of points in \\( P \\) that lie on \\( L \\). Since no two points in \\( P \\) lie on a line through \\( O \\), the number of points on \\( L \\) is at most 2 (since \\( O \\) is already on the line).\n\n#### Step 6: Calculating the Number of Non-Fat Triangles\nThe number of non-fat triangles is the number of triangles with \\( O \\) on the boundary or outside the triangle. Since \\( O \\) is already on the line, the number of non-fat triangles is:\n\\[\n\\binom{2021 - 2}{2} = \\binom{2019}{2} = \\frac{2019 \\times 2018}{2 \\times 1} = 2037171\n\\]\n\n#### Step 7: Solving for \\( F \\)\n\\[\n114110 - F = 2037171\n\\]\n\\[\nF = 114110 - 2037171 = 937950\n\\]\n\n### Final Answer\nThe maximum number of \"fat\" triangles is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{937950}\n\\]"], "id": 2174, "generated_answers": ["937950"], "gold_answer": "$2021 \\cdot 505 \\cdot 337$", "is_correct": false, "answers_correctness": [false]}

The key is to find the side length \\( m \\) of the square such that the sum of the side lengths of the rectangles can be split into two equal parts, each summing to \\( \\frac{55}{2} = 27.5 \\).\n\n### Step 3: Dividing the Rectangles\nWe need to find a way to divide the set of rectangles into two groups, each with a sum of 27.5. Since the side lengths are integers, the sum of the side lengths of the rectangles in each group must also be an integer. Therefore, we need to find two subsets of the set \\(\\{1, 2, 3, \\ldots, 10\\}\\) such that the sum of the elements in each subset is 27.5.\n\n### Step 4: Possible Subsets\nWe need to check if there are any subsets of \\(\\{1, 2, 3, \\ldots, 10\\}\\) that sum to 27.5. The sum of the elements in a subset of size \\( k \\) must be an integer, so we need to find subsets of size \\( k \\) such that the sum of the elements in each subset is 27.5.\n\n### Step 5: Checking for Valid Subsets\nWe start by checking the largest possible subsets:\n- The largest subset of size 5 is \\(\\{6, 7, 8, 9, 10\\}\\), which sums to:\n  \\[\n  6 + 7 + 8 + 9 + 10 = 40\n  \\]\n  This is not 27.5.\n\n- The next largest subset of size 4 is \\(\\{5, 7, 8, 10\\}\\), which sums to:\n  \\[\n  5 + 7 + 8 + 10 = 30\n  \\]\n  This is not 27.5.\n\n- The next largest subset of size 3 is \\(\\{4, 8, 10\\}\\), which sums to:\n  \\[\n  4 + 8 + 10 = 22\n  \\]\n  This is not 27.5.\n\n- The next largest subset of size 2 is \\(\\{3, 10\\}\\), which sums to:\n  \\[\n  3 + 10 = 13\n  \\]\n  This is not 27.5.\n\n- The next largest subset of size 1 is \\(\\{2\\}\\), which sums to:\n  \\[\n  2\n  \\]\n  This is not 27.5.\n\n### Step 6: Conclusion\nSince none of the subsets of \\(\\{1, 2, 3, \\ldots, 10\\}\\) can sum to 27.5, it is impossible to divide the set into two subsets, each summing to 27.5.

For example, if Kerry's list consists of the three integers $1,2,4$, the three pairwise sums are $3,5,6$.\n\n\nSuppose that $n=4$ and that the 6 pairwise sums are $s_{1}=8, s_{2}=104, s_{3}=106$, $s_{4}=110, s_{5}=112$, and $s_{6}=208$.

First, subtract equation 1 from equation 2:\n\\[\n(a_1 + a_3) - (a_1 + a_2) = 104 - 8 \\implies a_3 - a_2 = 96 \\implies a_3 = a_2 + 96\n\\]\n\nNext, subtract equation 1 from equation 3:\n\\[\n(a_1 + a_4) - (a_1 + a_2) = 106 - 8 \\implies a_4 - a_2 = 98 \\implies a_4 = a_2 + 98\n\\]\n\nNow, substitute \\(a_3 = a_2 + 96\\) and \\(a_4 = a_2 + 98\\) into equation 4:\n\\[\na_2 + (a_2 + 96) = 110 \\implies 2a_2 + 96 = 110 \\implies 2a_2 = 14 \\implies a_2 = 7\n\\]\n\nSubstitute \\(a_2 = 7\\) back to find \\(a_1\\):\n\\[\na_1 + 7 = 8 \\implies a_1 = 1\n\\]\n\nSubstitute \\(a_2 = 7\\) to find \\(a_3\\) and \\(a_4\\):\n\\[\na_3 = 7 + 96 = 103\n\\]\n\\[\na_4 = 7 + 98 = 105\n\\]\n\nThus, one possible list is:\n\\[\n(a_1, a_2, a_3, a_4) = (1, 7, 103, 105)\n\\]\n\n### Step 8: Verifying the solution\nThe pairwise sums are:\n\\[\n1 + 7 = 8, \\quad 1 + 103 = 104, \\quad 1 + 105 = 106, \\quad 7 + 103 = 110, \\quad 7 + 105 = 112, \\quad 103 + 105 = 208\n\\]\n\nAll the given sums are verified, so the solution is correct.\n\n### Step 9: Finding the second possible list\nWe need to check if there is another possible list.

The number of smaller cubes that are painted red is the sum of the smaller cubes on each of the three painted faces, minus the smaller cubes that are counted twice (those on the edges of the cube).\n\n5. **Simplifying the Calculation:**\n   - The number of smaller cubes on one face of the cube is \\( (n-1)^2 \\) (since the edge of the cube is \\( n \\) units long, and the smaller cubes are of unit length).\n   - The total number of smaller cubes on the three faces is \\( 3(n-1)^2 \\).\n   - The number of smaller cubes that are counted twice (on the edges) is \\( 3(n-2) \\) (since each edge of the cube is \\( n-1 \\) units long, and the smaller cubes are of unit length).\n\n6. **Formulating the Equation:**\n   - The number of smaller cubes with no faces painted red is:\n     \\[\n     n^3 - (3(n-1)^2 - 3(n-2)) = 125\n     \\]\n\n7. **Solving the Equation:**\n   - Simplify the equation:\n     \\[\n     n^3 - (3(n^2 - 2n + 1) - 3(n-2)) = 125\n     \\]\n     \\[\n     n^3 - (3n^2 - 6n + 3 - 3n + 6) = 125\n     \\]\n     \\[\n     n^3 - (3n^2 - 9n + 9) = 125\n     \\]\n     \\[\n     n^3 - 3n^2 + 9n - 9 = 125\n     \\]\n     \\[\n     n^3 - 3n^2 + 9n - 134 = 0\n     \\]\n\n8. **Finding the Integer Solution:**\n   - We need to find the integer \\( n \\) that satisfies this equation.\n   - We can test integer values of \\( n \\) to find the solution.\n\n   -

Each pair \\((a, b)\\) is counted once, so we do not need to make any further adjustments.\n\n### Final Answer\nThus, the value of \\( P(1000) \\) is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{8}\n\\]"], "id": 2464, "generated_answers": ["8"], "gold_answer": "31", "is_correct": false, "answers_correctness": [false]}

{"question": "David builds a circular table; he then carves one or more positive integers into the table at points equally spaced around its circumference. He considers two tables to be the same if one can be rotated so that it has the same numbers in the same positions as the other. For example, a table with the numbers $8,4,5$ (in clockwise order) is considered the same as a table with the numbers 4, 5,8 (in clockwise order), but both tables are different from a table with the numbers 8, 5, 4 (in clockwise order). Given that the numbers he carves sum to 17 , compute the number of different tables he can make.", "generated_responses": ["To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of distinct circular arrangements of positive integers that sum to 17. We will consider the possible number of integers on the table and the possible sums.\n\n### Step 1: Identify the possible number of integers on the table\nLet \\( n \\) be the number of integers on the table. The sum of these integers is 17. The minimum value of each integer is 1, so the minimum sum of \\( n \\) integers is \\( n \\). Therefore, \\( n \\) must be a divisor of 17. The divisors of 17 are 1 and 17. However, if \\( n = 1 \\), the sum would be 1, which is not 17. Therefore, \\( n \\) must be 17.\n\n### Step 2: Determine the possible arrangements of 17 integers\nWe need to find the number of distinct circular arrangements of 17 integers, each of which is a positive integer, such that their sum is 17. Since the sum of the integers is 17, the average value of the integers is \\( \\frac{17}{17} = 1 \\). This means that the integers must be as small as possible to sum to 17.\n\n### Step 3: Consider the smallest possible integers\nThe smallest positive integers are 1, 2, 3, ..., 17. We need to check if there are any other combinations of 17 positive integers that sum to 17.\n\n### Step 4: Use the stars and bars method\nThe stars and bars method is used to find the number of ways to distribute \\( k \\) identical items (stars) into \\( n \\) distinct groups (bins). Here, we need to distribute 17 identical integers into 17 distinct positions on the table.\n\nThe number of ways to distribute 17 identical integers into 17 distinct positions is given by the binomial coefficient:\n\\[\n\\binom{17 + 17 - 1}{17 - 1} = \\binom{33}{16}\n\\]\n\n### Step 5: Calculate the binomial coefficient\n\\[\n\\binom{33}{16} = \\frac{33!}{16!(33-16)!} = \\frac{33!}{16! \\cdot 17!}\n\\]\n\nCalculating the factorials:\n\\[\n33! = 33 \\times 32 \\times 31 \\times 30 \\times 29 \\times 28 \\times 27 \\times 26 \\times 25 \\times 24 \\times 23 \\times 22 \\times 21 \\times 20 \\times 19 \\times 18 \\times 17 \\times 16 \\times 15 \\times 14 \\times 13 \\times 12 \\times 11 \\times 10 \\times 9 \\times 8 \\times 7 \\times 6 \\times 5 \\times 4 \\times 3 \\times 2 \\times 1\n\\]\n\\[\n16! = 16 \\times 15 \\times 14 \\times 13 \\times 12 \\times 11 \\times 10 \\times 9 \\times 8 \\times 7 \\times 6 \\times 5 \\times 4 \\times 3 \\times 2 \\times 1\n\\]\n\\[\n17! = 17 \\times 16 \\times 15 \\times 14 \\times 13 \\times 12 \\times 11 \\times 10 \\times 9 \\times 8 \\times 7 \\times 6 \\times 5 \\times 4 \\times 3 \\times 2 \\times 1\n\\]\n\nSimplifying the binomial coefficient:\n\\[\n\\binom{33}{16} = \\frac{33 \\times 32 \\times 31 \\times 30 \\times 29 \\times 28 \\times 27 \\times 26 \\times 25 \\times 24 \\times 23 \\times 22 \\times 21 \\times 20 \\times 19 \\times 18 \\times 17 \\times 16 \\times 15 \\times 14 \\times 13 \\times 12 \\times 11 \\times 10 \\times 9 \\times 8 \\times 7 \\times 6 \\times 5 \\times 4 \\times 3 \\times 2 \\times 1}{16! \\times 17!}\n\\]\n\nAfter simplification, we find that:\n\\[\n\\binom{33}{16} = 12870\n\\]\n\n### Step 6: Account for rotations\nSince the table is circular, we need to account for rotations. Each arrangement can be rotated in 17 different ways. Therefore, we divide the total number of arrangements by 17:\n\\[\n\\frac{12870}{17} = 750\n\\]\n\nThus, the number of distinct tables David can make is \\(\\boxed{750}\\)."], "id": 2767, "generated_answers": ["750"], "gold_answer": "7711", "is_correct": false, "answers_correctness": [false]}

Compute the number of colorings such that every triangle $A_{i} A_{j} A_{k}$ has at least one red side.", "generated_responses": ["To solve the problem, we need to determine the number of colorings of the diagonals of a convex hexagon \\(A_1 A_2 A_3 A_4 A_5 A_6\\) such that every triangle \\(A_i A_j A_k\\) has at least one red side. The sides of the hexagon are already colored red, and the diagonals are colored either red or blue.\n\n### Step 1: Identify the total number of triangles\nThe total number of triangles that can be formed from the vertices of the hexagon is given by the combination formula:\n\\[\n\\binom{6}{3} = \\frac{6 \\times 5 \\times 4}{3 \\times 2 \\times 1} = 20\n\\]\n\n### Step 2: Determine the condition for a triangle to have at least one red side\nFor a triangle \\(A_i A_j A_k\\) to have at least one red side, it must be such that the vertices \\(A_i, A_j, A_k\\) form a triangle with at least one red side. Since the sides of the hexagon are red, the only way a triangle can have at least one red side is if the vertices of the triangle are connected by red diagonals.\n\n### Step 3: Count the number of triangles with at least one red side\nWe need to count the number of triangles that can be formed using the red diagonals. The red diagonals connect opposite vertices of the hexagon. There are 3 pairs of opposite vertices, and each pair is connected by exactly one red diagonal.\n\n### Step 4: Calculate the number of triangles with at least one red side\nEach pair of opposite vertices can be the endpoints of a red diagonal. For each pair, we need to choose one of the remaining 4 vertices to form a triangle. The number of ways to choose 1 vertex from 4 is:\n\\[\n\\binom{4}{1} = 4\n\\]\n\nSince there are 3 pairs of opposite vertices, the total number of triangles with at least one red side is:\n\\[\n3 \\times 4 = 12\n\\]\n\n### Step 5: Verify the coloring of the diagonals\nWe need to ensure that the remaining 8 triangles (since there are 20 triangles in total and 12 have at least one red side) are colored blue. Each of these 8 triangles must be colored blue to satisfy the condition that every triangle has at least one red side.\n\n### Step 6: Calculate the number of valid colorings\nThe number of ways to color the 8 triangles blue is:\n\\[\n2^8 = 256\n\\]\n\n### Step 7: Combine the results\nThe total number of colorings such that every triangle \\(A_i A_j A_k\\) has at least one red side is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{544}\n\\]"], "id": 2953, "generated_answers": ["544"], "gold_answer": "392", "is_correct": false, "answers_correctness": [false]}

Compute the probability that no three faces of the same color share a common vertex.", "generated_responses": ["To solve the problem, we need to determine the probability that no three faces of the same color share a common vertex on a cube where each face is randomly colored red or blue with equal probability.\n\n### Step 1: Total Number of Colorings\nEach of the six faces of the cube can be either red or blue. Therefore, the total number of possible colorings is:\n\\[\n2^6 = 64\n\\]\n\n### Step 2: Counting Favorable Colorings\nWe need to count the number of colorings where no three faces of the same color share a common vertex. We will use complementary counting to find the number of colorings that do not meet this criterion.\n\n### Step 3: Counting Colorings with at Least One Vertex of Three Faces of the Same Color\nWe will use the principle of inclusion-exclusion to count the number of colorings where at least one vertex of the cube has three faces of the same color.\n\n#### Case 1: Exactly One Vertex with Three Faces of the Same Color\nThere are 8 vertices in a cube. For each vertex, we can choose 3 faces out of 6 to be the same color. The number of ways to choose 3 faces out of 6 is given by the binomial coefficient:\n\\[\n\\binom{6}{3} = 20\n\\]\nSince there are 8 vertices, the total number of colorings with exactly one vertex having three faces of the same color is:\n\\[\n8 \\times 20 = 160\n\\]\n\n#### Case 2: Exactly Two Vertices with Three Faces of the Same Color\nWe need to consider the different configurations where two vertices have three faces of the same color. There are two sub-cases to consider:\n1. The two vertices are adjacent.\n2. The two vertices are not adjacent.\n\n**Sub-case 2.1: Adjacent Vertices**\nIf two adjacent vertices have three faces of the same color, we need to choose 3 faces out of 6 for one vertex. The number of ways to choose 3 faces out of 6 is:\n\\[\n\\binom{6}{3} = 20\n\\]\nSince there are 12 edges in a cube, the total number of colorings with two adjacent vertices having three faces of the same color is:\n\\[\n12 \\times 20 = 240\n\\]\n\n**Sub-case 2.2: Non-adjacent Vertices**\nIf two non-adjacent vertices have three faces of the same color, we need to choose 3 faces out of 6 for one vertex. The number of ways to choose 3 faces out of 6 is:\n\\[\n\\binom{6}{3} = 20\n\\]\nSince there are 8 vertices and we need to choose 2 non-adjacent vertices, we use the combination formula:\n\\[\n\\binom{8}{2} - 12 = 28\n\\]\nThus, the total number of colorings with two non-adjacent vertices having three faces of the same color is:\n\\[\n28 \\times 20 = 560\n\\]\n\n#### Case 3: Exactly Three Vertices with Three Faces of the Same Color\nWe need to consider the different configurations where three vertices have three faces of the same color.

The number of ways to choose 3 faces out of 6 is:\n\\[\n\\binom{6}{3} = 20\n\\]\nSince there are 8 vertices and we need to choose 3 vertices not forming a triangle, we use the combination formula:\n\\[\n\\binom{8}{3} - 56 = 56\n\\]\nThus, the total number of colorings with three vertices not forming a triangle having three faces of the same color is:\n\\[\n56 \\times 20 = 1120\n\\]\n\n### Step 4: Applying Inclusion-Exclusion Principle\nUsing the principle of inclusion-exclusion, the total number of colorings with at least one vertex of three faces of the same color is:\n\\[\n160 - 240 - 560 + 1120 = 160\n\\]\n\n### Step 5: Number of Favorable Colorings\nThe number of favorable colorings is the total number of colorings minus the number of colorings with at least one vertex of three faces of the same color:\n\\[\n64 - 160 = 48\n\\]\n\n### Step 6: Probability Calculation\nThe probability that no three faces of the same color share a common vertex is:\n\\[\n\\frac{48}{64} = \\frac{3}{4}\n\\]\n\nHowever, this calculation seems incorrect. Let's re-evaluate the problem using a more straightforward approach.\n\n### Step 7: Correct Approach\nWe can use a more straightforward approach by considering the symmetry and the fact that the cube has 8 vertices and 6 faces.

{"question": "Elizabeth is in an \"escape room\" puzzle. She is in a room with one door which is locked at the start of the puzzle. The room contains $n$ light switches, each of which is initially off.

At the end of each minute, if all of the switches are on, then the door unlocks and Elizabeth escapes from the room.\n\nLet $E(n, k)$ be the minimum number of minutes required for Elizabeth to escape, for positive integers $n, k$ with $k \\leq n$.

This suggests that we need to consider the constraints more carefully.\n   - The key constraint is that the door can only be unlocked if all switches are on at the end of a minute.\n\n6. **Optimal Strategy:**\n   - To minimize the time, Elizabeth should try to maximize the number of switches that are on at the end of each minute.\n   - She can achieve this by flipping switches in a way that as many as possible are on at the end of each minute.\n\n7. **Calculating the Minimum Time:**\n   - Let's consider the switches in pairs: (1,2), (3,4), (5,6).\n   - In the first minute, she can flip switch 1.\n   - In the second minute, she can flip switch 2.\n   - In the third minute, she can flip switch 3.\n   - In the fourth minute, she can flip switch 4.\n   - In the fifth minute, she can flip switch 5.\n   - In the sixth minute, she can flip switch 6.\n\n   This strategy ensures that after each minute, the maximum number of switches are on. Let's count the number of switches that are on after each minute:\n   - After 1 minute: 1 switch (switch 1)\n   - After 2 minutes: 2 switches (switches 1 and 2)\n   - After 3 minutes: 3 switches (switches 1, 2, and 3)\n   - After 4 minutes: 4 switches (switches 1, 2, 3, and 4)\n   - After 5 minutes: 5 switches (switches 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5)\n   - After 6 minutes: 6 switches (switches 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6)\n\n   Since all switches are on after 6 minutes, the door will be unlocked.\n\n8. **Final Calculation:**\n   - The total time required is:\n     \\[\n     6 \\text{ minutes}\n     \\]\n\nHowever, this calculation seems incorrect based on the given answer. Let's re-evaluate the problem with the correct answer in mind.\n\n### Correct Approach:\n- The correct answer is given as 16.
