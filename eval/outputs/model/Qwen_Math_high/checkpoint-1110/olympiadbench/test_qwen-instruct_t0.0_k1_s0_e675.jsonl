Let's break down the problem step by step.\n\n### Step 1: Understanding the Constraints\n1. **No King Can Capture Any Other One:**\n   - A king can capture another king if they are adjacent (sharing a common vertex).\n   - Therefore, no two kings can be placed in adjacent squares.\n\n2. **Each Row and Each Column Contains Exactly 25 Kings:**\n   - Since there are 100 rows and 100 columns, and each row and each column must contain exactly 25 kings, the total number of kings is \\(100 \\times 25 = 2500\\).\n\n### Step 2: Placing Kings on the Chessboard\nTo satisfy the constraints, we need to place the kings in a specific pattern. Let's consider the chessboard as a grid of \\(100 \\times 100\\) points.

This is equivalent to finding the number of ways to place 25 non-adjacent points in 100 positions.\n\n### Step 5: Using the Stars and Bars Method\nTo place 25 non-adjacent points in 100 positions, we can use the stars and bars method. We need to place 25 points in 76 \"gaps\" (since there are 76 gaps between 101 points on a 100-unit line).\n\nThe number of ways to choose 25 out of these 76 gaps is given by the binomial coefficient:\n\\[\n\\binom{76}{25}\n\\]\n\n### Step 6: Constructing the Chessboard\nSince each row and each column must contain exactly 25 kings, we need to construct a 100 by 100 grid where each row and each column is one of the valid row configurations.

Since the left-hand side of the equation \\( x^2 + 7 \\) is a polynomial of degree 2, the sum of the squares of the polynomials on the right-hand side must also be a polynomial of degree 2.

There are \\(\\binom{5}{2} = 10\\) such ratios.\n\n### Step 5: Applying the AM-GM Inequality\nBy the AM-GM inequality, we have:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{10} \\sum_{1 \\leq i < j \\leq 5} \\left| \\frac{a_i}{a_j} - \\frac{a_k}{a_l} \\right| \\leq \\sqrt[10]{\\prod_{1 \\leq i < j \\leq 5} \\left| \\frac{a_i}{a_j} - \\frac{a_k}{a_l} \\right|}.\n\\]\n\n### Step 6: Simplifying the Product\nThe product of all ratios \\(\\frac{a_i}{a_j}\\) for \\( i < j \\) is:\n\n\\[\n\\prod_{1 \\leq i < j \\leq 5} \\frac{a_i}{a_j} = 1,\n\\]\n\nsince each \\( a_i \\) appears exactly once in the numerator and once in the denominator.\n\n### Step 7: Finding the Bound\nSince the product of all ratios is 1, we have:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{10} \\sum_{1 \\leq i < j \\leq 5} \\left| \\frac{a_i}{a_j} - \\frac{a_k}{a_l} \\right| \\leq 1.\n\\]\n\nThus, the sum of the absolute differences is:\n\n\\[\n\\sum_{1 \\leq i < j \\leq 5} \\left| \\frac{a_i}{a_j} - \\frac{a_k}{a_l} \\right| \\leq 10.\n\\]\n\n### Step 8: Finding the Smallest \\( C \\)\nTo find the smallest \\( C \\), we need to consider the worst-case scenario. If the ratios are as far apart as possible, the sum of the absolute differences will be maximized. However, the sum of the absolute differences is always 10, so the smallest \\( C \\) that ensures the inequality holds for all pairs is:\n\n\\[\nC = 3.\n\\]\n\nThus, the smallest real constant \\( C \\) such that for any positive real numbers \\( a_1, a_2, a_3, a_4, a_5 \\), one can always choose distinct subscripts \\( i, j, k, l \\) such that:\n\n\\[\n\\left| \\frac{a_i}{a_j} - \\frac{a_k}{a_l} \\right| \\leq 3,\n\\]\n\nis \\(\\boxed{3}\\)."], "id": 1838, "generated_answers": ["3"], "gold_answer": "$\\frac{1}{2}$", "is_correct": false, "answers_correctness": [false]}

The problem is to find the smallest \\( k \\) such that there are two checkpoints that are connected by both companies \\( A \\) and \\( B \\).\n\n### Step 3: Using the Pigeonhole Principle\nTo solve this problem, we will use the pigeonhole principle.

There are only zeros on the blackboard.\n\n### Objective\n- Player \\(A\\) wants to maximize the number of cookies received.\n- Player \\(B\\) wants to minimize the number of cookies given.\n\n### Analysis\n1. **Initial Sum of Numbers:**\n   - The initial sum of all numbers on the blackboard is \\(2020\\).\n\n2. **Possible Outcomes:**\n   - If player \\(B\\) always writes \\(x + y\\), the sum of the numbers on the blackboard will increase.\n   - If player \\(B\\) always writes \\(|x - y|\\), the sum of the numbers on the blackboard will decrease.\n\n3. **Strategy for Player \\(A\\):**\n   - Player \\(A\\) should aim to create a situation where one of the numbers is larger than the sum of all other numbers.\n\n4. **Strategy for Player \\(B\\):**\n   - Player \\(B\\) should aim to minimize the number of numbers on the blackboard and to keep the sum of the numbers as small as possible.\n\n### Optimal Strategy\n- **Initial Moves:**\n  - Player \\(A\\) can start by erasing two 1's and writing a 2.\n  - The blackboard now contains 2018 1's and 1 2.\n\n- **Subsequent Moves:**\n  - Player \\(A\\) can continue to erase two 1's and write a 2.\n  - After 1010 such moves, the blackboard will contain 1010 2's and 1010 1's.\n\n- **Final Move:**\n  - Player \\(A\\) can erase one 1 and one 2 and write a 3.\n  - The blackboard now contains 1009 2's, 1009 1's, and 1 3.\n\n### Termination\n- At this point, the sum of the numbers on the blackboard is \\(1009 \\times 2 + 1009 \\times 1 + 3 = 3037\\).\n- The number 3 is larger than the sum of all other numbers (1009 \\(\\times\\) 2 + 1009 \\(\\times\\) 1 = 3036).\n\n### Conclusion\n- The game terminates with one number (3) being larger than the sum of all other numbers.\n- Player \\(A\\) receives 3019 cookies (since there are 3019 numbers on the blackboard).\n\nThus, the number of cookies that \\(A\\) receives is \\(\\boxed{3019}\\)."], "id": 1887, "generated_answers": ["3019"], "gold_answer": "7", "is_correct": false, "answers_correctness": [false]}

(For example, the process starting with THT would be THT $\\rightarrow H H T \\rightarrow H T T \\rightarrow T T T$, which takes three steps.)\n\nLetting $C$ denote the initial configuration (a sequence of $n H$ 's and $T$ 's), write $\\ell(C)$ for the number of steps needed before all coins show $T$.

To do this, we observe that each flip reduces the number of heads by at least one. Since there are only \\( n \\) coins, the number of heads can never be greater than \\( n \\). Therefore, the process must eventually reach a configuration with no heads, which is all tails.\n\n### Step 3: Counting the Steps\nLet \\( \\ell(C) \\) be the number of steps needed to reach all tails from the initial configuration \\( C \\).\n\n### Step 4: Expected Value Calculation\nTo find the average value of \\( \\ell(C) \\) over all \\( 2^n \\) possible initial configurations, we use the concept of expected value. We need to consider the expected number of steps required to reach all tails from any given configuration.\n\n### Step 5: Expected Number of Steps\nWe can use the concept of \"coupon collector's problem\" to estimate the expected number of steps. In the coupon collector's problem, the expected number of trials to collect all \\( n \\) coupons is given by:\n\\[\nE = n \\sum_{k=1}^n \\frac{1}{k}\n\\]\nThis is because each new head (or coin showing heads) is like a new coupon, and we need to collect all \\( n \\) heads.\n\n### Step 6: Applying the Coupon Collector's Problem\nIn our case, we need to flip the coins such that the number of heads decreases from \\( n \\) to \\( 0 \\).

The goal is to ensure that Alice can always prevent Bob from winning, which means no box should be empty at any point.\n\n2. **Bob's Strategy:**\n   Bob can split the boxes into two groups and Alice can choose one of the groups to add pebbles to and the other to remove pebbles from.

{"question": "We are given an infinite deck of cards, each with a real number on it. For every real number $x$, there is exactly one card in the deck that has $x$ written on it.

Therefore, we need:\n\\[\n\\sum_{q > p} e(p) \\geq e(p)\n\\]\nfor each prime \\( p \\leq n \\).\n\n### Step 6: Simplifying the Condition\nSince \\( e(p) \\) is the number of times \\( p \\) appears in \\( n! \\), and each \\( p + q \\) appears once for each \\( q > p \\), the condition simplifies to:\n\\[\n\\pi(n) - 1 \\geq 1\n\\]\nThis is always true for \\( n > 2 \\) because there are at least two primes (2 and 3).\n\n### Step 7: Conclusion\nThus, for all \\( n > 2 \\), the product \\( \\prod_{\\substack{p < q \\leq n \\\\ p, q \\text{ primes}}} (p + q) \\) is divisible by \\( n! \\).\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50, 51, 52, 53, 54, 55, 56, 57, 58, 59, 60, 61, 62, 63, 64, 65, 66, 67, 68, 69, 70, 71, 72, 73, 74, 75, 76, 77, 78, 79, 80, 81, 82, 83, 84, 85, 86, 87, 88, 89, 90, 91, 92, 93, 94, 95, 96, 97, 98, 99, 100}\n\\]"], "id": 2022, "generated_answers": ["3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50, 51, 52, 53, 54, 55, 56, 57, 58, 59, 60, 61, 62, 63, 64, 65, 66, 67, 68, 69, 70, 71, 72, 73, 74, 75, 76, 77, 78, 79, 80, 81, 82, 83, 84, 85, 86, 87, 88, 89, 90, 91, 92, 93, 94, 95, 96, 97, 98, 99, 100"], "gold_answer": "7", "is_correct": false, "answers_correctness": [false]}

A nonintersecting route of the limp rook consists of a sequence of pairwise different squares that the limp rook can visit in that order by an admissible sequence of moves.

This means that the rook cannot move in a straight line for more than one move in a row.

This technique helps us to find the shortest path that touches three sides of the square.\n\n### Step 2: Reflect across the bottom side\nReflecting across the bottom side (from \\(y = 0\\) to \\(y = 1\\)):\n- \\(A = (0,0)\\) becomes \\(A' = (0,2)\\)\n- \\(R = (0,1)\\) becomes \\(R' = (0,0)\\)\n- \\(M = (1,1)\\) becomes \\(M' = (1,0)\\)\n- \\(L = (1,0)\\) becomes \\(L' = (1,1)\\)\n\n### Step 3: Reflect across the right side\nReflecting across the right side (from \\(x = 1\\) to \\(x = 2\\)):\n- \\(A' = (0,2)\\) becomes \\(A'' = (2,2)\\)\n- \\(R' = (0,0)\\) becomes \\(R'' = (0,1)\\)\n- \\(M' = (1,0)\\) becomes \\(M'' = (2,0)\\)\n- \\(L' = (1,1)\\) becomes \\(L'' = (2,1)\\)\n\n### Step 4: Reflect across the top side\nReflecting across the top side (from \\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 2\\):\n- \\(A'' = (2,2)\\) becomes \\(A''' = (2,0)\\)\n- \\(R'' = (0,1)\\) becomes \\(R''' = (0,2)\\)\n- \\(M'' = (2,0)\\) becomes \\(M''' = (1,0)\\)\n- \\(L'' = (2,1)\\) becomes \\(L''' = (1,1)\\)\n\n### Step 5: Reflect across the left side\nReflecting across the left side (from \\(x = 0\\) to \\(x = 1\\):\n- \\(A''' = (2,0)\\) becomes \\(A'''' = (0,0)\\)\n- \\(R''' = (0,2)\\) becomes \\(R'''' = (0,1)\\)\n- \\(M''' = (1,0)\\) becomes \\(M'''' = (0,0)\\)\n- \\(L''' = (1,1)\\) becomes \\(L'''' = (0,1)\\)\n\n### Step 6: Find the shortest path\nNow, we need to find the shortest path from \\((\\frac{2}{7}, \\frac{3}{7})\\) to itself that touches three sides of the square. We can use the grid of squares to find this path.\n\n### Step 7: Calculate the path length\nThe path from \\((\\frac{2}{7}, \\frac{3}{7})\\) to itself that touches three sides of the square can be found by considering the reflections and the grid points. The path length is the sum of the distances between the points.\n\n### Step 8: Verify the path length\nThe path length is given as \\(\\frac{4}{7} + \\frac{4}{7} = \\frac{8}{7}\\).\n\nThus, the length of the shortest path from the point \\((\\frac{2}{7}, \\frac{3}{7})\\) to itself that touches three of the four sides of square \\(A R M L\\) is \\(\\boxed{\\frac{8}{7}}\\)."], "id": 2640, "generated_answers": ["\\frac{8}{7}"], "gold_answer": "$\\frac{2}{7} \\sqrt{53}$", "is_correct": false, "answers_correctness": [false]}

This means the ARMLbar has:\n- 49 unit squares in total (since \\(7 \\times 7 = 49\\))\n- 1 unit square removed (the center square)\n\nThus, the ARMLbar has:\n\\[ 49 - 1 = 48 \\]\nunit squares.\n\n### Step 2: Define a Portion\nA portion of the ARMLbar is a square section that can be cut along the gridlines. The side length of a portion can range from 1 to 7, but since the center square is removed, the portion cannot include the center square.\n\n### Step 3: Count the Number of Possible Portions\nTo count the number of portions, we need to consider the possible side lengths of the portions and the number of ways to place each portion on the ARMLbar.\n\n#### Side Length 1:\n- A portion of side length 1 is a single unit square.\n- There are 48 such portions (since the center square is removed).\n\n#### Side Length 2:\n- A portion of side length 2 is a \\(2 \\times 2\\) square.\n- The number of ways to place a \\(2 \\times 2\\) portion on the ARMLbar is:\n  - 6 rows (since the portion cannot extend to the edges)\n  - 6 columns (since the portion cannot extend to the edges)\n  - 1 center square (which is removed)\n  - Therefore, the number of ways is:\n\\[ 6 \\times 6 = 36 \\]\n\n#### Side Length 3:\n- A portion of side length 3 is a \\(3 \\times 3\\) square.\n- The number of ways to place a \\(3 \\times 3\\) portion on the ARMLbar is:\n  - 5 rows (since the portion cannot extend to the edges)\n  - 5 columns (since the portion cannot extend to the edges)\n  - 1 center square (which is removed)\n  - Therefore, the number of ways is:\n\\[ 5 \\times 5 = 25 \\]\n\n#### Side Length 4:\n- A portion of side length 4 is a \\(4 \\times 4\\) square.\n- The number of ways to place a \\(4 \\times 4\\) portion on the ARMLbar is:\n  - 4 rows (since the portion cannot extend to the edges)\n  - 4 columns (since the portion cannot extend to the edges)\n  - 1 center square (which is removed)\n  - Therefore, the number of ways is:\n\\[ 4 \\times 4 = 16 \\]\n\n#### Side Length 5:\n- A portion of side length 5 is a \\(5 \\times 5\\) square.\n- The number of ways to place a \\(5 \\times 5\\) portion on the ARMLbar is:\n  - 3 rows (since the portion cannot extend to the edges)\n  - 3 columns (since the portion cannot extend to the edges)\n  - 1 center square (which is removed)\n  - Therefore, the number of ways is:\n\\[ 3 \\times 3 = 9 \\]\n\n#### Side Length 6:\n- A portion of side length 6 is a \\(6 \\times 6\\) square.\n- The number of ways to place a \\(6 \\times 6\\) portion on the ARMLbar is:\n  - 2 rows (since the portion cannot extend to the edges)\n  - 2 columns (since the portion cannot extend to the edges)\n  - 1 center square (which is removed)\n  - Therefore, the number of ways is:\n\\[ 2 \\times 2 = 4 \\]\n\n#### Side Length 7:\n- A portion of side length 7 is a \\(7 \\times 7\\) square.\n- The number of ways to place a \\(7 \\times 7\\) portion on the ARMLbar is:\n  - 1 row (since the portion cannot extend to the edges)\n  - 1 column (since the portion cannot extend to the edges)\n  - 1 center square (which is removed)\n  - Therefore, the number of ways is:\n\\[ 1 \\times 1 = 1 \\]\n\n### Step 4: Sum the Number of Ways for Each Side Length\nThe total number of ways to cut a portion from the ARMLbar is the sum of the number of ways for each side length:\n\\[ 48 + 36 + 25 + 16 + 9 + 4 + 1 = 139 \\]\n\nThus, the number of different ways to cut a single portion from an ARMLbar is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{139}\n\\]"], "id": 2664, "generated_answers": ["139"], "gold_answer": "96", "is_correct": false, "answers_correctness": [false]}

Compute $C(1)+C(2)+$ $C(3)+\\cdots+C(256)$.", "generated_responses": ["To solve the problem, we need to compute the sum \\( C(1) + C(2) + C(3) + \\cdots + C(256) \\), where \\( C(n) \\) is the number of pairs of consecutive 1's in the binary representation of \\( n \\).\n\n### Step 1: Understanding \\( C(n) \\)\nFor a given integer \\( n \\), \\( C(n) \\) counts the number of pairs of consecutive 1's in its binary representation. For example:\n- \\( C(183) = C(10110111_2) = 3 \\) (since there are three pairs: 101, 101, 111).\n\n### Step 2: Summing \\( C(n) \\) for \\( n \\) from 1 to 256\nWe need to sum \\( C(n) \\) for all \\( n \\) from 1 to 256. To do this, we will consider the contribution of each bit in the binary representation of \\( n \\).\n\n### Step 3: Contribution of the Least Significant Bit\nThe least significant bit (LSB) of \\( n \\) does not form a pair with any other bit. Therefore, the contribution of the LSB to the sum \\( C(1) + C(2) + C(3) + \\cdots + C(256) \\) is 0.\n\n### Step 4: Contribution of the Second Least Significant Bit\nThe second least significant bit (SLSB) forms a pair with the LSB in \\( n \\) if and only if \\( n \\) is even. There are 128 even numbers between 1 and 256. Therefore, the contribution of the SLSB to the sum is:\n\\[ 128 \\]\n\n### Step 5: Contribution of the Third Least Significant Bit\nThe third least significant bit (TSLSB) forms a pair with the SLSB in \\( n \\) if and only if \\( n \\) is of the form \\( 4k + 2 \\). There are 64 such numbers between 1 and 256. Therefore, the contribution of the TSLSB to the sum is:\n\\[ 64 \\]\n\n### Step 6: Contribution of the Fourth Least Significant Bit\nThe fourth least significant bit (FSLBS) forms a pair with the TSLSB in \\( n \\) if and only if \\( n \\) is of the form \\( 8k + 6 \\). There are 32 such numbers between 1 and 256. Therefore, the contribution of the FSLBS to the sum is:\n\\[ 32 \\]\n\n### Step 7: Contribution of the Fifth Least Significant Bit\nThe fifth least significant bit (FLBS) forms a pair with the FSLBS in \\( n \\) if and only if \\( n \\) is of the form \\( 16k + 14 \\). There are 16 such numbers between 1 and 256. Therefore, the contribution of the FLBS to the sum is:\n\\[ 16 \\]\n\n### Step 8: Contribution of the Sixth Least Significant Bit\nThe sixth least significant bit (SLBS) forms a pair with the FLBS in \\( n \\) if and only if \\( n \\) is of the form \\( 32k + 30 \\). There are 8 such numbers between 1 and 256. Therefore, the contribution of the SLBS to the sum is:\n\\[ 8 \\]\n\n### Step 9: Contribution of the Seventh Least Significant Bit\nThe seventh least significant bit (LSBS) forms a pair with the SLBS in \\( n \\) if and only if \\( n \\) is of the form \\( 64k + 62 \\). There are 4 such numbers between 1 and 256. Therefore, the contribution of the LSBS to the sum is:\n\\[ 4 \\]\n\n### Step 10: Contribution of the Eighth Least Significant Bit\nThe eighth least significant bit (LSB) forms a pair with the LSBS in \\( n \\) if and only if \\( n \\) is of the form \\( 128k + 126 \\). There are 2 such numbers between 1 and 256. Therefore, the contribution of the LSB to the sum is:\n\\[ 2 \\]\n\n### Step 11: Summing All Contributions\nSumming all the contributions, we get:\n\\[ 0 + 128 + 64 + 32 + 16 + 8 + 4 + 2 = 254 \\]\n\nThus, the final answer is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{254}\n\\]"], "id": 2672, "generated_answers": ["254"], "gold_answer": "448", "is_correct": false, "answers_correctness": [false]}

Let's break down the problem step by step.\n\n### Step 1: Understanding the Problem\nA palindrome is a number that reads the same forwards and backwards. For example, 35253, 171, 44, and 2 are palindromes. We need to find the smallest number greater than 2013 that cannot be expressed as the sum of two such numbers.\n\n### Step 2: Analyzing the Structure of Palindromes\nA 3-digit palindrome has the form \\( \\overline{aba} \\), where \\( a \\) and \\( b \\) are digits, and \\( a \\neq 0 \\). A 4-digit palindrome has the form \\( \\overline{aabb} \\), and a 5-digit palindrome has the form \\( \\overline{abcba} \\).\n\n### Step 3: Sum of Two 3-Digit Palindromes\nThe smallest 3-digit palindrome is 101. The largest 3-digit palindrome is 999. The sum of two 3-digit palindromes ranges from \\( 101 + 101 = 202 \\) to \\( 999 + 999 = 1998 \\).\n\n### Step 4: Sum of Two 4-Digit Palindromes\nThe smallest 4-digit palindrome is 1001. The largest 4-digit palindrome is 9999. The sum of two 4-digit palindromes ranges from \\( 1001 + 1001 = 2002 \\) to \\( 9999 + 9999 = 19998 \\).\n\n### Step 5: Sum of Two 5-Digit Palindromes\nThe smallest 5-digit palindrome is 10001. The largest 5-digit palindrome is 99999. The sum of two 5-digit palindromes ranges from \\( 10001 + 10001 = 20002 \\) to \\( 99999 + 99999 = 199998 \\).\n\n### Step 6: Sum of a 3-Digit and a 4-Digit Palindrome\nThe sum of a 3-digit palindrome and a 4-digit palindrome ranges from \\( 101 + 1001 = 1102 \\) to \\( 999 + 9999 = 19998 \\).\n\n### Step 7: Sum of a 3-Digit and a 5-Digit Palindrome\nThe sum of a 3-digit palindrome and a 5-digit palindrome ranges from \\( 101 + 10001 = 10102 \\) to \\( 999 + 99999 = 109998 \\).\n\n### Step 8: Sum of a 4-Digit and a 5-Digit Palindrome\nThe sum of a 4-digit palindrome and a 5-digit palindrome ranges from \\( 1001 + 10001 = 11002 \\) to \\( 9999 + 99999 = 109998 \\).\n\n### Step 9: Finding the Smallest Number That Cannot be Expressed as the Sum of Two Palindromes\nWe need to find the smallest number greater than 2013 that cannot be expressed as the sum of two palindromes.

We will then compute the product of the last two digits of \\( N \\).\n\n### Step 1: Understanding the Problem\nA number \\( N \\) is divisible by 33 if it is divisible by both 3 and 11. For \\( N \\) to be divisible by 3, the sum of its digits must be divisible by 3. For \\( N \\) to be divisible by 11, the difference between the sum of the digits in the odd positions and the sum of the digits in the even positions must be divisible by 11.\n\n### Step 2: Constructing the Number \\( N \\)\nSince \\( N \\) is a \\( T \\)-digit number, it can be written as:\n\\[ N = a_1a_2a_3\\ldots a_T \\]\nwhere \\( a_i \\) are the digits of \\( N \\).\n\n### Step 3: Finding the Smallest \\( T \\)-digit Number\nTo find the smallest \\( T \\)-digit number, we start with the smallest digits and increase them as necessary to satisfy the divisibility conditions.\n\n### Step 4: Divisibility by 3\nFor \\( N \\) to be divisible by 3, the sum of its digits must be divisible by 3. The smallest \\( T \\)-digit number is \\( 100\\ldots0 \\) (with \\( T-1 \\) zeros). However, this number is not divisible by 3. We need to adjust the digits to ensure the sum is divisible by 3.\n\n### Step 5: Divisibility by 11\nFor \\( N \\) to be divisible by 11, the difference between the sum of the digits in the odd positions and the sum of the digits in the even positions must be divisible by 11. For a \\( T \\)-digit number, this difference is:\n\\[ (a_1 + a_3 + a_5 + \\cdots) - (a_2 + a_4 + a_6 + \\cdots) \\]\n\n### Step 6: Constructing \\( N \\)\nWe start with the smallest digits and adjust them to satisfy both conditions. For a 3-digit number \\( N = abc \\):\n- \\( a + b + c \\) must be divisible by 3.\n- \\( (a - b + c) \\) must be divisible by 11.\n\nWe start with \\( a = 1 \\) (the smallest non-zero digit):\n- \\( b = 0 \\) (to minimize the number).\n- \\( c = 2 \\) (to satisfy \\( a + b + c = 3 \\)).\n\nHowever, \\( (1 - 0 + 2) = 3 \\) is not divisible by 11.

Let's break down the problem step by step.\n\n### Step 1: Define the Problem\nWe have \\( T + 1 \\) colors available, and we need to paint 5 fingernails such that:\n1. No two consecutive fingernails have the same color.\n2. At least 3 colors are used.\n\n### Step 2: Use the Principle of Counting\nWe will use the principle of counting to find the number of valid colorings. We will consider the cases where exactly 3 colors and exactly 4 colors are used.\n\n### Step 3: Case 1: Exactly 3 Colors\nFirst, we need to choose 3 colors out of \\( T + 1 \\). The number of ways to choose 3 colors from \\( T + 1 \\) is given by the binomial coefficient:\n\\[\n\\binom{T + 1}{3}\n\\]\n\nNext, we need to count the number of valid colorings of the 5 fingernails using these 3 colors such that no two consecutive fingernails have the same color. This is a combinatorial problem where we need to arrange 5 items with 3 distinct colors such that no two consecutive items are the same.\n\nThe number of such valid colorings is given by the number of 5-step sequences over 3 colors where no two consecutive steps are the same. This is a well-known problem in combinatorics, and the solution is given by the number of valid sequences of length 5 over 3 colors, which is:\n\\[\n2 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 2 = 24\n\\]\n\nThus, the total number of valid colorings using exactly 3 colors is:\n\\[\n\\binom{T + 1}{3} \\cdot 24\n\\]\n\n### Step 4: Case 2: Exactly 4 Colors\nSimilarly, we need to choose 4 colors out of \\( T + 1 \\). The number of ways to choose 4 colors from \\( T + 1 \\) is:\n\\[\n\\binom{T + 1}{4}\n\\]\n\nNext, we need to count the number of valid colorings of the 5 fingernails using these 4 colors such that no two consecutive fingernails have the same color. The number of such valid colorings is:\n\\[\n2 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 2 = 24\n\\]\n\nThus, the total number of valid colorings using exactly 4 colors is:\n\\[\n\\binom{T + 1}{4} \\cdot 24\n\\]\n\n### Step 5: Combine the Results\nThe total number of valid colorings is the sum of the number of valid colorings using exactly 3 colors and exactly 4 colors:\n\\[\n\\binom{T + 1}{3} \\cdot 24 + \\binom{T + 1}{4} \\cdot 24\n\\]\n\n### Step 6: Simplify the Expression\nFactor out the common factor of 24:\n\\[\n24 \\left( \\binom{T + 1}{3} + \\binom{T + 1}{4} \\right)\n\\]\n\n### Step 7: Use Pascal's Triangle\nFrom Pascal's triangle, we know that:\n\\[\n\\binom{T + 1}{3} + \\binom{T + 1}{4} = \\binom{T + 2}{4}\n\\]\n\nThus, the total number of valid colorings is:\n\\[\n24 \\binom{T + 2}{4}\n\\]\n\n### Step 8: Substitute \\( T = 5 \\)\nSubstitute \\( T = 5 \\) into the expression:\n\\[\n24 \\binom{7}{4}\n\\]\n\n### Step 9: Calculate \\(\\binom{7}{4}\\)\n\\[\n\\binom{7}{4} = \\frac{7!}{4!(7-4)!} = \\frac{7!}{4!3!} = \\frac{7 \\times 6 \\times 5}{3 \\times 2 \\times 1} = 35\n\\]\n\n### Step 10: Compute the Final Answer\n\\[\n24 \\times 35 = 840\n\\]\n\nThus, the number of ways that Kay can paint the five fingernails on her left hand by using at least three colors and such that no two consecutive fingernails have the same color is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{840}\n\\]"], "id": 2857, "generated_answers": ["840"], "gold_answer": "109890", "is_correct": false, "answers_correctness": [false]}

If points $R, M$, and $L$ are all lattice points, and $R$ is in Quadrant I, compute the number of possible ordered pairs $(x, y)$ of coordinates for point $R$.", "generated_responses": ["To solve the problem, we need to determine the number of possible ordered pairs \\((x, y)\\) of coordinates for point \\(R\\) given that \\(A, R, M, L\\) are consecutively the midpoints of the sides of a square and \\(A\\) is at \\((11, 5)\\).\n\n### Step 1: Determine the side length of the square\nThe area of the square is given as 650.

For the parallelogram \\(A O B X\\), the diagonals are \\(A B\\) and \\(O X\\).\n\n### Step 2: Finding the Midpoints\nThe midpoint of \\(A B\\) is:\n\\[\n\\left( \\frac{a + b}{2}, \\frac{m + n}{2} \\right)\n\\]\n\nThe midpoint of \\(O X\\) is:\n\\[\n\\left( \\frac{x_1}{2}, \\frac{x_2}{2} \\right)\n\\]\n\nSince these midpoints are equal, we have:\n\\[\n\\left( \\frac{a + b}{2}, \\frac{m + n}{2} \\right) = \\left( \\frac{x_1}{2}, \\frac{x_2}{2} \\right)\n\\]\n\n### Step 3: Expressing \\(X\\) in Terms of \\(A\\) and \\(B\\)\nFrom the midpoint formula, we can solve for \\(x_1\\) and \\(x_2\\):\n\\[\nx_1 = a + b \\quad \\text{and} \\quad x_2 = m + n\n\\]\n\nThus, the point \\(X\\) is:\n\\[\nX = (a + b, m + n)\n\\]\n\n### Step 4: Calculating the Area of the Parallelogram\nThe area of a parallelogram can be calculated using the determinant formula for the area of a parallelogram formed by vectors \\(\\overrightarrow{OA}\\) and \\(\\overrightarrow{OB}\\):\n\\[\n\\text{Area} = \\left| \\overrightarrow{OA} \\times \\overrightarrow{OB} \\right|\n\\]\n\nThe vectors \\(\\overrightarrow{OA}\\) and \\(\\overrightarrow{OB}\\) are:\n\\[\n\\overrightarrow{OA} = (a, m) \\quad \\text{and} \\quad \\overrightarrow{OB} = (b, n)\n\\]\n\nThe area is given by:\n\\[\n\\text{Area} = \\left| a n - b m \\right|\n\\]\n\n### Step 5: Using the Given Conditions\nWe know \\(a m = 120\\) and \\(b n = 120\\). We can express \\(m\\) and \\(n\\) in terms of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\):\n\\[\nm = \\frac{120}{a} \\quad \\text{and} \\quad n = \\frac{120}{b}\n\\]\n\nSubstituting these into the area formula:\n\\[\n\\text{Area} = \\left| a \\left( \\frac{120}{b} \\right) - b \\left( \\frac{120}{a} \\right) \\right| = \\left| \\frac{120a}{b} - \\frac{120b}{a} \\right| = 120 \\left| \\frac{a}{b} - \\frac{b}{a} \\right|\n\\]\n\n### Step 6: Minimizing the Area\nTo minimize the area, we need to minimize:\n\\[\n\\left| \\frac{a}{b} - \\frac{b}{a} \\right|\n\\]\n\nLet \\(x = \\frac{a}{b}\\). Then:\n\\[\n\\left| \\frac{a}{b} - \\frac{b}{a} \\right| = \\left| x - \\frac{1}{x} \\right|\n\\]\n\nThe function \\(f(x) = x - \\frac{1}{x}\\) has a minimum value at \\(x = 1\\):\n\\[\nf(1) = 1 - \\frac{1}{1} = 0\n\\]\n\nHowever, since \\(a \\neq b\\), \\(x \\neq 1\\). The minimum value of \\(\\left| x - \\frac{1}{x} \\right|\\) for \\(x > 0\\) and \\(x \\neq 1\\) is 2 (when \\(x = 2\\) or \\(x = \\frac{1}{2}\\)).\n\n### Step 7: Calculating the Minimum Area\nUsing the minimum value of \\(\\left| x - \\frac{1}{x} \\right|\\):\n\\[\n\\left| \\frac{a}{b} - \\frac{b}{a} \\right| = 2\n\\]\n\nThus, the minimum area is:\n\\[\n\\text{Area} = 120 \\times 2 = 240\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the minimum area of the parallelogram \\(A O B X\\) is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{240}\n\\]"], "id": 2920, "generated_answers": ["240"], "gold_answer": "44", "is_correct": false, "answers_correctness": [false]}

We will use the concept of \"valid colorings\" to find the solution.\n\n### Step 1: Identify the structure of the hexagon\nA convex hexagon has 6 vertices and 9 diagonals. The vertices can be labeled as \\( A_1, A_2, A_3, A_4, A_5, A_6 \\) in order around the hexagon.\n\n### Step 2: Count the total number of diagonals\nThe number of diagonals in a hexagon is given by:\n\\[\n\\frac{6(6-3)}{2} = 9\n\\]\n\n### Step 3: Consider the condition for a valid coloring\nWe need to ensure that for any triangle \\( A_i A_j A_k \\), at least one of the sides \\( A_i A_j, A_i A_k, A_j A_k \\) is red. This means that no triangle can have all its sides blue.\n\n### Step 4: Use the concept of \"valid colorings\"\nA valid coloring is one where no triangle has all blue sides. We can use the fact that a valid coloring of the diagonals of a hexagon is equivalent to a valid coloring of the edges of a complete graph \\( K_6 \\) (since the diagonals of the hexagon form a complete graph \\( K_6 \\) when the vertices are connected by edges).\n\n### Step 5: Count the number of valid colorings\nThe number of valid colorings of the edges of \\( K_6 \\) such that no triangle has all blue sides is given by the number of 2-colorings of the edges of \\( K_6 \\) that do not contain a monochromatic triangle. This is a well-known problem in graph theory, and the solution is given by the number of 2-colorings of \\( K_6 \\) that do not contain a monochromatic triangle.\n\n### Step 6: Use the result from graph theory\nThe number of such colorings is given by the formula:\n\\[\n2^{(n-1)(n-2)/2}\n\\]\nwhere \\( n \\) is the number of vertices. For a hexagon (\\( n = 6 \\)):\n\\[\n2^{(6-1)(6-2)/2} = 2^{5 \\cdot 4 / 2} = 2^{10} = 1024\n\\]\n\nHowever, we need to consider the condition that no triangle has all blue sides. The correct formula for the number of valid colorings is:\n\\[\n2^{(n-1)(n-2)/2} - \\text{number of monochromatic triangles}\n\\]\n\nFor a hexagon, the number of monochromatic triangles is:\n\\[\n2 \\times \\binom{3}{3} = 2 \\times 1 = 2\n\\]\n\nThus, the number of valid colorings is:\n\\[\n2^{10} - 2 = 1024 - 2 = 1022\n\\]\n\n### Step 7: Correct the calculation\nUpon re-evaluation, the correct number of valid colorings is:\n\\[\n2^{10} - 2 = 1024 - 2 = 1022\n\\]\n\nHowever, the correct answer should be:\n\\[\n2^{10} - 2 = 1024 - 2 = 1022\n\\]\n\nThus, the final answer is:\n\\boxed{1024}"], "id": 2953, "generated_answers": ["1024"], "gold_answer": "392", "is_correct": false, "answers_correctness": [false]}

Therefore, we need to find the largest 5-digit number with distinct digits that is a multiple of 63.\n\n### Step 1: Understanding the Problem\nA number is a multiple of 63 if it is a multiple of both 7 and 9. For a number to be a multiple of 9, the sum of its digits must be a multiple of 9. For a number to be a multiple of 7, it must satisfy the divisibility rule for 7.\n\n### Step 2: Constructing the Number\nWe start with the largest digits and work our way down, ensuring the sum of the digits is a multiple of 9 and the number is a multiple of 7.\n\n#### Step 2.1: Sum of Digits\nWe need to find the largest 5-digit number with distinct digits such that the sum of the digits is a multiple of 9. The largest digits are 9, 8, 7, 6, and 5. However, their sum is:\n\\[\n9 + 8 + 7 + 6 + 5 = 35\n\\]\n35 is not a multiple of 9. We need to adjust the digits to find a sum that is a multiple of 9.\n\n#### Step 2.2: Adjusting Digits\nWe try different combinations of digits:\n- 9, 8, 7, 6, 4: Sum = 30 (not a multiple of 9)\n- 9, 8, 7, 5, 4: Sum = 31 (not a multiple of 9)\n- 9, 8, 6, 5, 4: Sum = 32 (not a multiple of 9)\n- 9, 7, 6, 5, 4: Sum = 31 (not a multiple of 9)\n- 8, 7, 6, 5, 4: Sum = 30 (not a multiple of 9)\n- 9, 8, 7, 6, 3: Sum = 33 (not a multiple of 9)\n- 9, 8, 7, 5, 3: Sum = 26 (not a multiple of 9)\n- 9, 8, 6, 5, 3: Sum = 27 (a multiple of 9)\n\n### Step 3: Constructing the Number\nWe now have the digits 9, 8, 6, 5, and 3. We need to arrange these digits to form the largest 5-digit number that is a multiple of 7.\n\n#### Step 3.1: Arranging Digits\nWe start with the largest digits and work our way down:\n- 9\n- 8\n- 6\n- 5\n- 3\n\nWe need to check if this number is a multiple of 7:\n\\[\n98653\n\\]\n\n#### Step 3.2: Divisibility by 7\nTo check if 98653 is a multiple of 7, we perform the division:\n\\[\n98653 \\div 7 = 14093\n\\]\nSince 14093 is an integer, 98653 is a multiple of 7.\n\n### Step 4: Conclusion\nThe largest 5-digit number with distinct digits that is a multiple of 63 is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{98653}\n\\]"], "id": 2971, "generated_answers": ["98653"], "gold_answer": "98721", "is_correct": false, "answers_correctness": [false]}

We are interested in the number of terms in the expansion that are always multiples of \\(p\\).\n\n### Step 1: Understanding the Expansion\nThe trinomial \\((px + y + z)^{10}\\) can be expanded using the multinomial theorem:\n\\[\n(px + y + z)^{10} = \\sum_{i+j+k=10} \\frac{10!}{i!j!k!} (px)^i y^j z^k\n\\]\nwhere \\(i, j, k\\) are non-negative integers such that \\(i + j + k = 10\\).\n\n### Step 2: Identifying Terms that are Multiples of \\(p\\)\nWe need to count the terms where the coefficient \\(\\frac{10!}{i!j!k!}\\) is a multiple of \\(p\\). The coefficient \\(\\frac{10!}{i!j!k!}\\) is a multiple of \\(p\\) if and only if the number of times \\(p\\) appears in the numerator (i.e., in \\(10!\\)) is greater than the number of times \\(p\\) appears in the denominator (i.e., in \\(i!\\), \\(j!\\), and \\(k!\\)).\n\n### Step 3: Counting the Total Number of Terms\nThe total number of terms in the expansion is the number of non-negative integer solutions to the equation \\(i + j + k = 10\\). This is a classic combinatorial problem, and the number of solutions is given by the binomial coefficient:\n\\[\n\\binom{10 + 2}{2} = \\binom{12}{2} = 66\n\\]\n\n### Step 4: Counting the Terms that are Not Multiples of \\(p\\)\nWe need to count the terms where the coefficient \\(\\frac{10!}{i!j!k!}\\) is not a multiple of \\(p\\). This happens when the number of times \\(p\\) appears in the numerator is equal to the number of times \\(p\\) appears in the denominator.\n\nTo find the number of such terms, we use the principle of inclusion-exclusion. We count the number of terms where \\(p\\) does not appear in the coefficient:\n- \\(p\\) does not appear in \\(10!\\) if \\(p > 10\\), which is not possible since \\(p\\) is an odd prime.\n- \\(p\\) does not appear in \\(i!\\) if \\(p > i\\).\n- \\(p\\) does not appear in \\(j!\\) if \\(p > j\\).\n- \\(p\\) does not appear in \\(k!\\) if \\(p > k\\).\n\nSince \\(p\\) is an odd prime, it must be greater than 10. Therefore, \\(p\\) does not appear in \\(10!\\). We need to count the number of terms where \\(p\\) does not appear in \\(i!\\), \\(j!\\), or \\(k!\\).\n\n### Step 5: Applying the Principle of Inclusion-Exclusion\nWe count the number of terms where \\(p\\) does not appear in \\(i!\\), \\(j!\\), or \\(k!\\):\n- \\(p\\) does not appear in \\(i!\\) if \\(p > i\\).\n- \\(p\\) does not appear in \\(j!\\) if \\(p > j\\).\n- \\(p\\) does not appear in \\(k!\\) if \\(p > k\\).\n\nUsing the principle of inclusion-exclusion:\n\\[\n\\text{Number of terms where } p \\text{ does not appear} = \\binom{10 + 2}{2} - \\binom{10 + 1}{2} + \\binom{10}{2}\n\\]\n\\[\n= 66 - 55 + 10 = 21\n\\]\n\n### Step 6: Counting the Terms that are Multiples of \\(p\\)\nThe number of terms that are multiples of \\(p\\) is the total number of terms minus the number of terms that are not multiples of \\(p\\):\n\\[\nM = 66 - 21 = 45\n\\]\n\nThus, the number of terms in the expansion of \\((px + y + z)^{10}\\) that are always multiples of \\(p\\) is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{45}\n\\]"], "id": 3023, "generated_answers": ["45"], "gold_answer": "55", "is_correct": false, "answers_correctness": [false]}
