{"question": "If $f(x)$ is a polynomial of degree 7, and $g(x)$ is a polynomial of degree 7, then what is the product of the minimum and the maximum possible degrees of $f(x) + g(x)$?", "generated_responses": ["To solve the problem, we need to determine the possible degrees of the polynomial \\( f(x) + g(x) \\) when \\( f(x) \\) and \\( g(x) \\) are both polynomials of degree 7.\n\n### Step 1: Understanding the Degrees of Polynomials\n- The degree of a polynomial is the highest power of \\( x \\) with a non-zero coefficient.\n- If \\( f(x) \\) and \\( g(x) \\) are both polynomials of degree 7, then the highest power of \\( x \\) in both \\( f(x) \\) and \\( g(x) \\) is \\( x^7 \\).\n\n### Step 2: Degree of the Sum of Two Polynomials\n- The degree of the sum of two polynomials is determined by the highest degree term that does not cancel out.\n- The maximum possible degree of \\( f(x) + g(x) \\) occurs when the leading coefficients of \\( f(x) \\) and \\( g(x) \\) do not cancel each other out. In this case, the degree of \\( f(x) + g(x) \\) is 7.\n- The minimum possible degree of \\( f(x) + g(x) \\) occurs when the leading coefficients of \\( f(x) \\) and \\( g(x) \\) are exactly opposite in sign and equal in magnitude, causing the \\( x^7 \\) terms to cancel out. In this case, the degree of \\( f(x) + g(x) \\) is less than 7. The lowest possible degree is 0, which occurs if all terms cancel out, resulting in a constant polynomial.\n\n### Step 3: Calculating the Product\n- The maximum possible degree of \\( f(x) + g(x) \\) is 7.\n- The minimum possible degree of \\( f(x) + g(x) \\) is 0.\n- The product of the minimum and maximum possible degrees is:\n  \\[\n  7 \\times 0 = 0\n  \\]\n\nThus, the product of the minimum and maximum possible degrees of \\( f(x) + g(x) \\) is \\(\\boxed{0}\\)."], "id": "1", "generated_answers": ["0"], "gold_answer": "0", "is_correct": true, "answers_correctness": [true]}
