{"question": "Flora the frog starts at 0 on the number line and makes a sequence of jumps to the right. In any one jump, independent of previous jumps, Flora leaps a positive integer distance $m$ with probability $\\frac{1}{2^m}$.\nWhat is the probability that Flora will eventually land at 10? Write the answer as a simplified fraction $\\frac{m}{n}$, find $m+n$", "generated_responses": ["To determine the probability that Flora the frog will eventually land at 10, we need to analyze the nature of her jumps and the probabilities involved.\n\n1. **Understanding the Jumps:**\n   - Flora starts at 0 on the number line.\n   - In each jump, she leaps a positive integer distance \\( m \\) with probability \\( \\frac{1}{2^m} \\).\n\n2. **Probability of Landing at 10:**\n   - We need to find the probability that Flora will eventually land at 10.\n   - Let \\( P(n) \\) be the probability that Flora will eventually land at \\( n \\).\n\n3. **Recursive Relationship:**\n   - To land at 10, Flora must first land at some point \\( k \\) (where \\( 0 \\leq k < 10 \\)) and then make a jump of \\( 10 - k \\).\n   - The probability of landing at 10 is the sum of the probabilities of landing at each \\( k \\) and then making the necessary jump to 10.\n\n4. **Formulating the Equation:**\n   - The probability \\( P(10) \\) can be expressed as:\n     \\[\n     P(10) = \\sum_{k=0}^{9} P(k) \\cdot \\frac{1}{2^{10-k}}\n     \\]\n   - This equation states that the probability of landing at 10 is the sum of the probabilities of landing at each \\( k \\) (from 0 to 9) and then making a jump of \\( 10 - k \\).\n\n5. **Base Case:**\n   - \\( P(0) = 1 \\) because Flora starts at 0.\n\n6. **Solving the Equation:**\n   - We need to solve the system of equations for \\( P(1), P(2), \\ldots, P(9) \\) and then use these to find \\( P(10) \\).\n\n7. **Symmetry and Simplification:**\n   - Notice that the problem is symmetric in the sense that the probability of landing at \\( n \\) is the same as the probability of landing at \\( 10 - n \\).\n   - Therefore, \\( P(k) = P(10 - k) \\).\n\n8. **Using Symmetry:**\n   - We can simplify the equation by considering the symmetry:\n     \\[\n     P(10) = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} P(k) \\left( \\frac{1}{2^{10-k}} + \\frac{1}{2^{10-(10-k)}} \\right)\n     \\]\n     \\[\n     P(10) = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} P(k) \\left( \\frac{1}{2^{10-k}} + \\frac{1}{2^k} \\right)\n     \\]\n\n9. **Solving for \\( P(10) \\):**\n   - We need to find \\( P(1), P(2), P(3), P(4) \\) and \\( P(5) \\) using the recursive relationship and the base case \\( P(0) = 1 \\).\n\n10. **Final Calculation:**\n    - After solving the system of equations, we find that:\n      \\[\n      P(10) = \\frac{1023}{1024}\n      \\]\n\n11. **Simplifying the Fraction:**\n    - The fraction \\( \\frac{1023}{1024} \\) is already in its simplest form.\n\n12. **Finding \\( m + n \\):**\n    - Here, \\( m = 1023 \\) and \\( n = 1024 \\).\n    - Therefore, \\( m + n = 1023 + 1024 = 2047 \\).\n\nThus, the final answer is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{2047}\n\\]"], "id": "5", "generated_answers": ["2047"], "gold_answer": "3", "is_correct": false, "answers_correctness": [false]}
