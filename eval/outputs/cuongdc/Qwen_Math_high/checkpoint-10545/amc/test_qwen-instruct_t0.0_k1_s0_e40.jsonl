{"question": "If $A$ and $B$ are vertices of a polyhedron, define the distance $d(A,B)$ to be the minimum number of edges of the polyhedron one must traverse in order to connect $A$ and $B$.

This is a classic problem in number theory known as the Frobenius coin problem, which seeks the largest number that cannot be expressed as a non-negative integer combination of the given coin values.\n\n### Step 1: Understanding the Problem\nWe are given coin values \\(6\\), \\(10\\), and \\(15\\) cents. We need to find the largest value \\(x\\) that cannot be expressed as:\n\\[ 6a + 10b + 15c \\]\nwhere \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are non-negative integers.\n\n### Step 2: Simplifying the Problem\nFirst, we note that \\(15\\) is a multiple of \\(5\\). Therefore, any combination of \\(6a + 10b + 15c\\) will also be a multiple of \\(5\\). This is because:\n\\[ 6a + 10b + 15c = 5(2b + 3c) + 6a \\]\nSince \\(5(2b + 3c)\\) is always a multiple of \\(5\\), the entire expression \\(6a + 10b + 15c\\) will be a multiple of \\(5\\) if and only if \\(6a\\) is a multiple of \\(5\\). This implies that \\(a\\) must be a multiple of \\(5\\).\n\n### Step 3: Reducing the Problem\nLet \\(a = 5k\\) for some non-negative integer \\(k\\). Then the expression becomes:\n\\[ 6(5k) + 10b + 15c = 30k + 10b + 15c \\]\nWe can factor out \\(5\\):\n\\[ 5(6k + 2b + 3c) \\]\nThus, we need to find the largest number that cannot be expressed as:\n\\[ 5(6k + 2b + 3c) \\]\nThis is equivalent to finding the largest number that cannot be expressed as:\n\\[ 6k + 2b + 3c \\]\nwhere \\(k\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are non-negative integers.\n\n### Step 4: Applying the Chicken McNugget Theorem\nThe Chicken McNugget Theorem states that for two relatively prime integers \\(m\\) and \\(n\\), the largest number that cannot be expressed as \\(am + bn\\) for non-negative integers \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) is \\(mn - m - n\\).\n\nIn our case, we have \\(6k + 2b + 3c\\). We can combine \\(2b\\) and \\(3c\\) into a single term since \\(2\\) and \\(3\\) are relatively prime. Let \\(d = 2b + 3c\\). Then we need to find the largest number that cannot be expressed as:\n\\[ 6k + d \\]\nwhere \\(d\\) can be any non-negative integer.\n\n### Step 5: Finding the Largest Number\nThe largest number that cannot be expressed as \\(6k + d\\) is:\n\\[ 6 \\cdot 1 - 6 - 1 = 5 \\]\nHowever, this is not the correct approach.
