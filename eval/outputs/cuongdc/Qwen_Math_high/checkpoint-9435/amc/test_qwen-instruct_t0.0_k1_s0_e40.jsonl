For example, we can guess (1,2) or (2,1).\n\n  - If (1,2) is covered, then the rectangle is either (1,2) and (2,2) or (1,2) and (1,3).\n  - If (2,1) is covered, then the rectangle is either (2,1) and (2,2) or (1,1) and (2,1).\n\n  In either case, we have identified at least one square covered by the rectangle.\n\n- If (2,2) is not covered, we need to guess one of the remaining 4 squares to ensure we cover at least one square in the rectangle.
