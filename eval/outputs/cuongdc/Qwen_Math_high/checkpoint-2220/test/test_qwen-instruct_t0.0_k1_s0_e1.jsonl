{"question": "If $f(x)$ is a polynomial of degree 7, and $g(x)$ is a polynomial of degree 7, then what is the product of the minimum and the maximum possible degrees of $f(x) + g(x)$?", "generated_responses": ["To determine the product of the minimum and maximum possible degrees of \\( f(x) + g(x) \\) where \\( f(x) \\) and \\( g(x) \\) are both polynomials of degree 7, we need to consider the degrees of the resulting polynomial \\( f(x) + g(x) \\).\n\n### Step 1: Maximum Possible Degree\nThe maximum possible degree of \\( f(x) + g(x) \\) occurs when the leading terms of \\( f(x) \\) and \\( g(x) \\) do not cancel each other out. Since both \\( f(x) \\) and \\( g(x) \\) are polynomials of degree 7, the leading term of \\( f(x) \\) is \\( a_7 x^7 \\) and the leading term of \\( g(x) \\) is \\( b_7 x^7 \\). If \\( a_7 \\neq -b_7 \\), the leading term of \\( f(x) + g(x) \\) will be \\( (a_7 + b_7) x^7 \\), which is a polynomial of degree 7.\n\nThus, the maximum possible degree of \\( f(x) + g(x) \\) is 7.\n\n### Step 2: Minimum Possible Degree\nThe minimum possible degree of \\( f(x) + g(x) \\) occurs when the leading terms of \\( f(x) \\) and \\( g(x) \\) exactly cancel each other out. In this case, the leading term of \\( f(x) + g(x) \\) will be zero, and the resulting polynomial will have a degree less than 7. The lowest possible degree of a non-zero polynomial is 0 (a constant polynomial).\n\nThus, the minimum possible degree of \\( f(x) + g(x) \\) is 0.\n\n### Step 3: Product of Minimum and Maximum Degrees\nNow, we need to find the product of the minimum and maximum possible degrees of \\( f(x) + g(x) \\):\n\\[\n\\text{Product} = 7 \\times 0 = 0\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the product of the minimum and maximum possible degrees of \\( f(x) + g(x) \\) is \\(\\boxed{0}\\)."], "id": "1", "generated_answers": ["0"], "gold_answer": "0", "is_correct": true, "answers_correctness": [true]}
