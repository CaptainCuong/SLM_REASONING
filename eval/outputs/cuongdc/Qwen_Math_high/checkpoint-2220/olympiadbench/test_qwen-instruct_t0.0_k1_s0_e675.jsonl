{"question": "Find (in closed form) the difference between the number of positive integers at most $2^{2017}$ with even weight and the number of positive integers at most $2^{2017}$ with odd weight.", "generated_responses": ["To solve the problem, we need to determine the difference between the number of positive integers at most \\(2^{2017}\\) with even weight and the number of positive integers at most \\(2^{2017}\\) with odd weight. We will use the properties of binary numbers and their weights to achieve this.\n\n### Step 1: Understanding Binary Weights\nThe weight of a binary number is the number of 1s in its binary representation. For example, the binary number \\(1011_2\\) has a weight of 3.\n\n### Step 2: Counting Binary Numbers with Even and Odd Weights\nConsider the set of all positive integers from 1 to \\(2^{2017}\\). Each of these integers can be represented as a binary number with at most 2017 bits.\n\n### Step 3: Symmetry in Binary Representation\nThe binary numbers from 0 to \\(2^{2017} - 1\\) are symmetric. For each binary number with a certain weight, there is a corresponding binary number with the complementary weight (i.e., the number of 0s and 1s are swapped). For example, if a number has 3 1s, its complement will have \\(2017 - 3\\) 1s.\n\n### Step 4: Parity of Weights\nThe total number of binary numbers from 0 to \\(2^{2017} - 1\\) is \\(2^{2017}\\). Since the weights are symmetric, the number of binary numbers with even weights is equal to the number of binary numbers with odd weights.\n\n### Step 5: Excluding Zero\nThe number 0 is not a positive integer, so we exclude it from our count. This means we are only considering the numbers from 1 to \\(2^{2017} - 1\\).\n\n### Step 6: Counting Positive Integers\nThe number of positive integers from 1 to \\(2^{2017} - 1\\) is \\(2^{2017} - 1\\).\n\n### Step 7: Even and Odd Weights in Positive Integers\nSince the weights are symmetric and there are \\(2^{2017} - 1\\) positive integers, half of them will have even weights and half will have odd weights. Therefore, the number of positive integers with even weights is:\n\\[\n\\frac{2^{2017} - 1}{2}\n\\]\nSimilarly, the number of positive integers with odd weights is:\n\\[\n\\frac{2^{2017} - 1}{2}\n\\]\n\n### Step 8: Calculating the Difference\nThe difference between the number of positive integers with even weights and the number of positive integers with odd weights is:\n\\[\n\\left( \\frac{2^{2017} - 1}{2} \\right) - \\left( \\frac{2^{2017} - 1}{2} \\right) = 0\n\\]\n\n### Step 9: Correcting the Approach\nWe need to consider the number of positive integers at most \\(2^{2017}\\), which includes \\(2^{2017}\\) itself. The number \\(2^{2017}\\) has a weight of 1 (since it is \\(1000\\ldots0_2\\)).\n\n### Step 10: Including \\(2^{2017}\\)\nThe number of positive integers at most \\(2^{2017}\\) is \\(2^{2017}\\). The number of positive integers with even weights is:\n\\[\n\\frac{2^{2017}}{2} = 2^{2016}\n\\]\nThe number of positive integers with odd weights is:\n\\[\n2^{2017} - 2^{2016} = 2^{2016}\n\\]\n\n### Step 11: Final Difference\nThe difference between the number of positive integers with even weights and the number of positive integers with odd weights is:\n\\[\n2^{2016} - (2^{2017} - 2^{2016}) = 2^{2016} - 2^{2016} + 2^{2016} = 2^{2016}\n\\]\n\nThus, the final answer is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{2^{2016}}\n\\]"], "id": 1612, "generated_answers": ["2^{2016}"], "gold_answer": "$2^{1009}$", "is_correct": false, "answers_correctness": [false]}

Here, \\( t(k) \\) denotes the largest odd divisor of \\( k \\).\n\n### Step 1: Understanding \\( t(k) \\)\nThe function \\( t(k) \\) gives the largest odd divisor of \\( k \\).

If \\( f_i(x) \\) are polynomials with rational coefficients, then \\( f_i(x)^2 \\) will have a degree that is twice the degree of \\( f_i(x) \\).

The leading coefficient of \\( x^2 \\) is 1. For the sum of squares of polynomials to have a leading coefficient of 1, the leading coefficients of the squares \\( f_i(x)^2 \\) must sum to 1. Since each \\( f_i(x)^2 \\) is a square of a polynomial, its leading coefficient must be non-negative. Therefore, the only way to sum to 1 with non-negative coefficients is if exactly one of the leading coefficients is 1 and the rest are 0.\n\n### Step 3: Consider the Constant Term\nThe constant term of \\( x^2 + 7 \\) is 7. For the sum of squares of polynomials to have a constant term of 7, the constant terms of the squares \\( f_i(x)^2 \\) must sum to 7. Since each \\( f_i(x)^2 \\) is a square of a polynomial, its constant term must be non-negative. Therefore, the only way to sum to 7 with non-negative constants is if exactly one of the constant terms is 7 and the rest are 0.\n\n### Step 4: Constructing the Polynomials\nTo satisfy both the leading coefficient and the constant term conditions, we need to find polynomials \\( f_i(x) \\) such that:\n- One \\( f_i(x) \\) has a leading coefficient of 1 and a constant term of 0.\n- One \\( f_i(x) \\) has a leading coefficient of 0 and a constant term of \\(\\sqrt{7}\\).\n\nHowever, \\(\\sqrt{7}\\) is not a rational number, so we cannot have a polynomial with a constant term of \\(\\sqrt{7}\\) and rational coefficients. Therefore, we need to find a different approach.\n\n### Step 5: Using Four Squares\nWe can use the fact that any positive rational number can be expressed as the sum of four squares of rational numbers. Specifically, we can write:\n\\[\n7 = 2^2 + 1^2 + 1^2 + 1^2.\n\\]\nThus, we can write:\n\\[\nx^2 + 7 = x^2 + 2^2 + 1^2 + 1^2 + 1^2.\n\\]\nThis can be expressed as:\n\\[\nx^2 + 7 = (x)^2 + (2)^2 + (1)^2 + (1)^2 + (1)^2.\n\\]\nHowever, we need to find a way to express \\( x^2 + 7 \\) as a sum of squares of polynomials with rational coefficients.

Let's break it down step by step.\n\n1. **Understanding the 2006-gon and Diagonals:**\n   - A regular 2006-gon has 2006 vertices.\n   - A diagonal is a line segment connecting two non-adjacent vertices.\n   - An odd diagonal is a diagonal whose endpoints divide the boundary into two parts, each composed of an odd number of sides.\n\n2. **Dissection into Triangles:**\n   - The 2006-gon is dissected into 2004 triangles using 2003 nonintersecting diagonals.\n   - Each triangle has three sides, and in this context, a side of a triangle can be either a side of the 2006-gon or a diagonal.\n\n3. **Isosceles Triangles with Two Odd Sides:**\n   - An isosceles triangle with two odd sides must have its third side (the base) as a side of the 2006-gon.\n   - The two equal sides of the isosceles triangle must be odd diagonals.\n\n4. **Counting the Odd Diagonals:**\n   - To form an isosceles triangle with two odd sides, we need to count the number of odd diagonals.\n   - An odd diagonal connects two vertices such that the number of sides between them is odd.\n   - In a regular 2006-gon, the number of odd diagonals from a given vertex is 1002 (since 2006 is even, half the vertices are an odd number of sides away).\n\n5. **Forming Isosceles Triangles:**\n   - Each pair of odd diagonals from a vertex can form an isosceles triangle with a side of the 2006-gon.\n   - The number of ways to choose 2 odd diagonals from 1002 is given by the binomial coefficient \\(\\binom{1002}{2}\\).\n\n6. **Calculating the Number of Isosceles Triangles:**\n   \\[\n   \\binom{1002}{2} = \\frac{1002 \\times 1001}{2} = 501 \\times 1001 = 501501\n   \\]\n\n7. **Adjusting for Overcounting:**\n   - Each isosceles triangle is counted twice (once for each vertex of the base).\n   - Therefore, the actual number of isosceles triangles is:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{501501}{2} = 250750.5\n   \\]\n\n8. **Final Answer:**\n   - Since the number of triangles must be an integer, we take the floor value:\n   \\[\n   \\boxed{1003}\n   \\]\n\nThus, the maximum possible number of isosceles triangles with two odd sides is \\(\\boxed{1003}\\)."], "id": 1750, "generated_answers": ["1003"], "gold_answer": "$1003$", "is_correct": true, "answers_correctness": [true]}

Each cell contains a distinct divisor.\n2. The sums of all rows are equal.\n3. The sums of all columns are equal.\n\nLet's denote the number of rows by \\( r \\) and the number of columns by \\( c \\). The total number of cells in the table is \\( r \\times c \\), which must equal the number of divisors of \\( n \\), denoted by \\( d(n) \\). Therefore, we have:\n\\[\nr \\times c = d(n)\n\\]\n\n### Step 1: Sum of Divisors\nThe sum of all divisors of \\( n \\) is denoted by \\( \\sigma(n) \\). Since the sums of all rows and columns are equal, let the sum of each row be \\( S \\) and the sum of each column be \\( T \\). Then, the total sum of all divisors can be expressed in two ways:\n\\[\nr \\times S = c \\times T = \\sigma(n)\n\\]\n\n### Step 2: Equating Row and Column Sums\nFrom the above equations, we have:\n\\[\nS = \\frac{\\sigma(n)}{r} \\quad \\text{and} \\quad T = \\frac{\\sigma(n)}{c}\n\\]\nSince \\( S \\) and \\( T \\) must be integers, \\( \\sigma(n) \\) must be divisible by both \\( r \\) and \\( c \\). Therefore, \\( \\sigma(n) \\) must be divisible by \\( \\text{lcm}(r, c) \\).\n\n### Step 3: Divisors and Sum of Divisors\nFor \\( n \\) to have a rectangular table of divisors with equal row and column sums, \\( n \\) must have a specific structure. Let's consider the possible values of \\( n \\):\n\n#### Case 1: \\( n \\) is a Prime Power\nIf \\( n = p^k \\) where \\( p \\) is a prime and \\( k \\) is a positive integer, the divisors of \\( n \\) are \\( 1, p, p^2, \\ldots, p^k \\). The number of divisors is \\( k+1 \\), and the sum of the divisors is:\n\\[\n\\sigma(p^k) = 1 + p + p^2 + \\cdots + p^k = \\frac{p^{k+1} - 1}{p - 1}\n\\]\nFor \\( n \\) to have a rectangular table, \\( k+1 \\) must be a product of two integers \\( r \\) and \\( c \\). However, the sum of the divisors \\( \\sigma(p^k) \\) is not generally divisible by both \\( r \\) and \\( c \\) in a way that allows for equal row and column sums. Therefore, \\( n \\) cannot be a prime power.\n\n#### Case 2: \\( n \\) is a Product of Two Distinct Primes\nIf \\( n = p_1 p_2 \\) where \\( p_1 \\) and \\( p_2 \\) are distinct primes, the divisors of \\( n \\) are \\( 1, p_1, p_2, p_1 p_2 \\). The number of divisors is 4, and the sum of the divisors is:\n\\[\n\\sigma(p_1 p_2) = 1 + p_1 + p_2 + p_1 p_2\n\\]\nFor \\( n \\) to have a rectangular table, 4 must be a product of two integers \\( r \\) and \\( c \\). The possible pairs \\((r, c)\\) are \\((2, 2)\\). The sum of the divisors is:\n\\[\n1 + p_1 + p_2 + p_1 p_2\n\\]\nFor the sums of the rows and columns to be equal, we need:\n\\[\n2S = 2T = 1 + p_1 + p_2 + p_1 p_2\n\\]\nThis implies:\n\\[\nS = T = \\frac{1 + p_1 + p_2 + p_1 p_2}{2}\n\\]\nFor \\( S \\) and \\( T \\) to be integers, \\( 1 + p_1 + p_2 + p_1 p_2 \\) must be even. Since \\( p_1 \\) and \\( p_2 \\) are distinct primes, one must be 2 (the only even prime).

The key is to place the marked cells in a pattern that leaves no room for alternative domino placements.\n\n### Step 4: Constructing a Pattern\nConsider a checkerboard pattern on the board. In a checkerboard pattern, each cell is either black or white, and adjacent cells are of different colors. If we mark all the black cells, we can see that the dominoes must cover the white cells and vice versa. This ensures a unique partition.\n\n### Step 5: Counting the Marked Cells\nIn a \\( 2n \\times 2n \\) board, half the cells are black and half are white. Therefore, the number of black cells (or white cells) is:\n\\[\n\\frac{4n^2}{2} = 2n^2\n\\]\n\n### Step 6: Verifying the Pattern\nIf we mark all the black cells, there is no other way to place the dominoes without covering two marked cells. This is because each domino must cover one black and one white cell, and if all black cells are marked, the white cells must be covered by the remaining dominoes.\n\n### Step 7: Conclusion\nThe smallest positive integer \\( k \\) such that it is possible to mark \\( k \\) cells on a \\( 2n \\times 2n \\) board so that there exists a unique partition of the board into \\( 1 \\times 2 \\) and \\( 2 \\times 1 \\) dominoes, none of which contains two marked cells, is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{2n^2}\n\\]"], "id": 1854, "generated_answers": ["2n^2"], "gold_answer": "$2 n$", "is_correct": false, "answers_correctness": [false]}

Let \\( a_i \\) be the number of pebbles in box \\( B_i \\) after the first round. We have:\n   \\[\n   \\sum_{i=1}^{60} a_i = n\n   \\]\n\n2. **Subsequent Rounds:**\n   In each subsequent round, Bob chooses an integer \\( k \\) with \\( 1 \\leq k \\leq 59 \\) and splits the boxes into two groups:\n   - Group 1: \\( B_1, B_2, \\ldots, B_k \\)\n   - Group 2: \\( B_{k+1}, B_{k+2}, \\ldots, B_{60} \\)\n\n   Alice then picks one of these groups and performs the following operations:\n   - Adds one pebble to each box in the chosen group.\n   - Removes one pebble from each box in the other group.\n\n3. **Effect of Each Round:**\n   Let's denote the number of pebbles in box \\( B_i \\) after the \\( r \\)-th round as \\( a_i^{(r)} \\). The operations in each round can be described as:\n   \\[\n   a_i^{(r+1)} = \n   \\begin{cases} \n   a_i^{(r)} + 1 & \\text{if } B_i \\text{ is in the chosen group} \\\\\n   a_i^{(r)} - 1 & \\text{if } B_i \\text{ is in the other group}\n   \\end{cases}\n   \\]\n\n4. **Parity Analysis:**\n   Notice that the parity (odd or even nature) of the number of pebbles in each box changes with each round. Specifically, if a box has an even number of pebbles, it will have an odd number of pebbles after a round, and vice versa.\n\n5. **Initial Parity:**\n   Since Alice starts with \\( n \\) pebbles, the parity of the number of pebbles in each box depends on the initial distribution. However, the total number of pebbles \\( n \\) is fixed.\n\n6. **Winning Condition:**\n   Bob wins if at the end of any round, some box contains no pebbles. For Bob to win, there must be a box with an odd number of pebbles (since removing one pebble from an odd number results in zero).\n\n7. **Preventing Bob from Winning:**\n   Alice can prevent Bob from winning by ensuring that no box has an odd number of pebbles at any point. This can be achieved if \\( n \\) is even, because:\n   - If \\( n \\) is even, Alice can distribute the pebbles such that each box has an even number of pebbles initially.\n   - In each subsequent round, the parity of the number of pebbles in each box will remain even, ensuring no box will have zero pebbles.\n\n8. **Smallest \\( n \\):**\n   The smallest even number greater than zero is 2. However, if \\( n = 2 \\), Alice can distribute the pebbles such that one box has 2 pebbles and the rest have 0 pebbles. Bob can then choose the group with the single box, and Alice will be forced to remove pebbles from that box, resulting in a box with zero pebbles.\n\n   Therefore, the smallest \\( n \\) that ensures Alice can always prevent Bob from winning is \\( n = 3 \\). With \\( n = 3 \\), Alice can distribute the pebbles such that no box has an odd number of pebbles initially, and the parity will remain even in subsequent rounds.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe smallest \\( n \\) such that Alice can prevent Bob from winning is \\(\\boxed{3}\\)."], "id": 1918, "generated_answers": ["3"], "gold_answer": "960", "is_correct": false, "answers_correctness": [false]}

However, this does not necessarily mean that the maximum absolute partial sum \\( G \\) will be small compared to \\( D \\). We need to consider the worst-case scenario for George's strategy.\n\n### Step 5: Constructing a Worst-Case Example\nConsider the sequence \\( x_1, x_2, \\ldots, x_n \\) where \\( x_i = (-1)^i \\).

For example, if \\( n = 3 \\) and the numbers are \\( 1, 1, -2 \\):\n- George might choose \\( -2, 1, 1 \\) to minimize the partial sums.\n- The partial sums are \\( -2, -1, 0 \\).\n- The maximum absolute partial sum \\( G \\) is 2.\n\n### Step 6: Generalizing the Example\nFor a general sequence, George's strategy might not always achieve the minimum possible price \\( D \\). However, it is known that George's strategy can be at most twice as bad as the optimal strategy. This is because at each step, George minimizes the partial sum, which can be at most twice the minimum possible price \\( D \\).\n\n### Step 7: Conclusion\nThus, the least possible constant \\( c \\) such that \\( G \\leq cD \\) for every positive integer \\( n \\) and every collection of \\( n \\) real numbers is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{2}\n\\]"], "id": 1968, "generated_answers": ["2"], "gold_answer": "2", "is_correct": true, "answers_correctness": [true]}

The key insight is that the rule must be based on the relative order of the elements in the sets \\( A \\) and \\( B \\).\n\n### Step 3: Considering the Median\nOne natural way to compare two sets is to use the median of the elements in each set. The median of a set of 100 elements is the 50th element when the elements are ordered. We can define the rule as follows:\n- If the median of \\( A \\) is greater than the median of \\( B \\), then \\( A \\) beats \\( B \\).\n- If the median of \\( A \\) is less than the median of \\( B \\), then \\( B \\) beats \\( A \\).\n- If the medians are equal, we can use a tie-breaking rule, but since the problem states that the rule should be based on the relative order, we can consider this a special case where the rule is not defined.\n\n### Step 4: Verifying the Rule\n- **Relative Order**: The rule depends only on the relative order of the 200 cards.\n- **Strictly Increasing Order**: If \\( a_i > b_i \\) for all \\( i \\), then the median of \\( A \\) will be greater than the median of \\( B \\), satisfying the condition.\n- **Transitivity**: If \\( A \\) beats \\( B \\) and \\( B \\) beats \\( C \\), then the median of \\( A \\) is greater than the median of \\( B \\), and the median of \\( B \\) is greater than the median of \\( C \\). Therefore, the median of \\( A \\) is greater than the median of \\( C \\), and \\( A \\) beats \\( C \\).\n\n### Step 5: Counting the Number of Ways\nSince the rule is based on the median, and the median is a unique element in a set of 100 elements, there is only one way to define such a rule. The rule is fixed by the definition of the median and the conditions given.\n\n### Final Answer\n\\[\n\\boxed{1}\n\\]"], "id": 1977, "generated_answers": ["1"], "gold_answer": "100", "is_correct": true, "answers_correctness": [true]}

Each subsequent field in the sequence is adjacent to the previous field.\n3. The numbers written on the fields in the sequence are in increasing order.\n\n### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Identify the First Field:**\n   - The first field in a good path must be a field that is only adjacent to fields with larger numbers. This means the first field must be a local minimum in the sequence of numbers on the board.\n\n2. **Count the Number of Local Minima:**\n   - In an \\( n \\times n \\) board, the number of local minima is at least \\( n \\). This is because in the worst case, the smallest number in each row can be a local minimum. Since there are \\( n \\) rows, there are at least \\( n \\) local minima.\n\n3. **Construct a Board with Minimum Good Paths:**\n   - To minimize the number of good paths, we need to ensure that each local minimum can only start one good path. This can be achieved by arranging the numbers in such a way that each local minimum is only adjacent to fields with larger numbers and no other local minima.\n\n4. **Example Configuration:**\n   - Consider a board where the numbers are arranged in a way that each row starts with a local minimum and the numbers increase as we move to the right. For example, in a 3x3 board:\n     \\[\n     \\begin{array}{ccc}\n     1 & 2 & 3 \\\\\n     4 & 5 & 6 \\\\\n     7 & 8 & 9 \\\\\n     \\end{array}\n     \\]\n   - In this configuration, the local minima are 1, 4, and 7. Each of these can only start one good path because they are the smallest numbers in their respective rows and are only adjacent to fields with larger numbers.\n\n5. **Generalize for \\( n \\times n \\) Board:**\n   - For an \\( n \\times n \\) board, we can arrange the numbers such that each row starts with a local minimum and the numbers increase as we move to the right. This ensures that each local minimum can only start one good path.\n\n6. **Conclusion:**\n   - Since there are at least \\( n \\) local minima, and each local minimum can only start one good path, the smallest possible number of good paths is \\( n \\).\n\nThus, the smallest possible number of good paths Alice can obtain is \\(\\boxed{n}\\)."], "id": 2011, "generated_answers": ["n"], "gold_answer": "$2 n^{2}-2 n+1$", "is_correct": false, "answers_correctness": [false]}

The function \\( f \\) is a bijection, meaning every non-negative integer is mapped to exactly once. Additionally, the function satisfies the conditions that if \\( f(x_1, y_1) > f(x_2, y_2) \\), then \\( f(x_1 + 1, y_1) > f(x_2 + 1, y_2) \\) and \\( f(x_1, y_1 + 1) > f(x_2, y_2 + 1) \\). This implies that \\( f \\) is a strictly increasing function in both \\( x \\) and \\( y \\).\n\n### Step 1: Understanding the Function \\( f \\)\nSince \\( f \\) is a bijection, it can be thought of as a way to order the pairs \\((x, y)\\) in a strictly increasing manner. One common way to do this is to use the Cantor pairing function, which is defined as:\n\\[\nf(x, y) = \\frac{(x + y)(x + y + 1)}{2} + y\n\\]\nThis function is known to be a bijection from \\(\\mathbb{Z}_{\\geq 0} \\times \\mathbb{Z}_{\\geq 0}\\) to \\(\\mathbb{Z}_{\\geq 0}\\).\n\n### Step 2: Parity of \\( f(x, y) \\)\nWe need to determine the parity (odd or even) of \\( f(x, y) \\). The function \\( f(x, y) \\) can be rewritten as:\n\\[\nf(x, y) = \\frac{(x + y)(x + y + 1)}{2} + y\n\\]\nThe term \\(\\frac{(x + y)(x + y + 1)}{2}\\) is the sum of the first \\( x + y \\) integers, which is always an integer. Therefore, the parity of \\( f(x, y) \\) depends on the parity of \\( y \\).\n\n- If \\( y \\) is even, then \\( f(x, y) \\) is even.\n- If \\( y \\) is odd, then \\( f(x, y) \\) is odd.\n\n### Step 3: Counting Pairs \\((x, y)\\) with \\( f(x, y) \\) Odd\nWe need to count the number of pairs \\((x, y)\\) such that \\( 0 \\leq x, y < 100 \\) and \\( f(x, y) \\) is odd. Since \\( f(x, y) \\) is odd if and only if \\( y \\) is odd, we need to count the number of pairs where \\( y \\) is odd.\n\nThere are 50 odd values for \\( y \\) in the range \\( 0 \\leq y < 100 \\). For each of these 50 values of \\( y \\), \\( x \\) can take any of the 100 values from 0 to 99. Therefore, the total number of pairs \\((x, y)\\) with \\( f(x, y) \\) odd is:\n\\[\n50 \\times 100 = 5000\n\\]\n\n### Step 4: Smallest and Largest Possible Values of \\( N \\)\nSince \\( f \\) is a bijection and the function \\( f(x, y) \\) is strictly increasing in both \\( x \\) and \\( y \\), the number of pairs \\((x, y)\\) with \\( f(x, y) \\) odd is fixed at 5000.

Each digit \\( d_i \\) (where \\( i \\) ranges from 1 to \\( n \\)) must satisfy \\( 0 \\leq d_i \\leq 9 \\) and \\( \\sum_{i=1}^n d_i = 5 \\).\n\n### Step 2: Using Combinatorics\nWe can use the stars and bars method to count the number of solutions to the equation \\( \\sum_{i=1}^n d_i = 5 \\) where \\( 0 \\leq d_i \\leq 9 \\). However, since the digits are bounded by 9, we need to ensure that no digit exceeds 9. This can be done using the principle of inclusion-exclusion.\n\n### Step 3: Simplifying the Problem\nFor small values of \\( n \\), we can directly count the number of valid combinations. For larger \\( n \\), we use the fact that the number of solutions to \\( \\sum_{i=1}^n d_i = 5 \\) is the same as the number of ways to distribute 5 indistinguishable items (stars) into \\( n \\) distinguishable bins (digits), which is given by the binomial coefficient:\n\\[\nf(n) = \\binom{n+4}{4}\n\\]\nThis formula counts the number of non-negative integer solutions to the equation \\( \\sum_{i=1}^n d_i = 5 \\).\n\n### Step 4: Units Digit of \\( f(n) \\)\nWe need to determine the units digit of \\( f(n) = \\binom{n+4}{4} \\). The units digit of a binomial coefficient \\( \\binom{n}{k} \\) depends on the units digits of \\( n \\) and \\( k \\). Specifically, we need to find the units digit of \\( \\binom{n+4}{4} \\).\n\n### Step 5: Pattern in Units Digits\nWe observe the units digits of \\( \\binom{n+4}{4} \\) for small values of \\( n \\):\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\binom{5}{4} &= 5 \\quad (\\text{units digit } 5) \\\\\n\\binom{6}{4} &= 15 \\quad (\\text{units digit } 5) \\\\\n\\binom{7}{4} &= 35 \\quad (\\text{units digit } 5) \\\\\n\\binom{8}{4} &= 70 \\quad (\\text{units digit } 0) \\\\\n\\binom{9}{4} &= 126 \\quad (\\text{units digit } 6) \\\\\n\\binom{10}{4} &= 210 \\quad (\\text{units digit } 0) \\\\\n\\binom{11}{4} &= 330 \\quad (\\text{units digit } 0) \\\\\n\\binom{12}{4} &= 495 \\quad (\\text{units digit } 5) \\\\\n\\binom{13}{4} &= 715 \\quad (\\text{units digit } 5) \\\\\n\\binom{14}{4} &= 1001 \\quad (\\text{units digit } 1) \\\\\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\n\n### Step 6: Periodicity\nWe observe that the units digits repeat every 10 values of \\( n \\). Specifically, the units digits of \\( \\binom{n+4}{4} \\) for \\( n = 1, 2, \\ldots, 10 \\) are:\n\\[ 5, 5, 5, 0, 6, 0, 0, 5, 5, 1 \\]\n\n### Step 7: Counting the Units Digit 1\nIn each block of 10 values, the units digit 1 appears once. Since there are 2014 values of \\( n \\), we divide 2014 by 10 to find the number of complete blocks and the remainder:\n\\[\n2014 \\div 10 = 201 \\text{ remainder } 4\n\\]\nThus, there are 201 complete blocks and 4 additional values. In the 201 complete blocks, the units digit 1 appears 201 times. In the 4 additional values, the units digits are 5, 5, 5, 0, so the units digit 1 does not appear.\n\n### Step 8: Final Answer\nTherefore, the number of values of \\( f(n) \\) for \\( n = 1, 2, \\ldots, 2014 \\) that have a units digit of 1 is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{201}\n\\]"], "id": 2350, "generated_answers": ["201"], "gold_answer": "202", "is_correct": false, "answers_correctness": [false]}

We need to determine a pattern in the indices of these palindromes.\n\n### Step 2: Determine the Pattern\nThe indices of the palindromes are 1, 2, 4, 6. This suggests that the palindromes occur at even indices. To confirm this, we need to check if \\(a_{2k}\\) is always a palindrome for \\(k \\geq 1\\).\n\n### Step 3: Prove by Induction\nWe will use induction to prove that \\(a_{2k}\\) is a palindrome for all \\(k \\geq 1\\).\n\n**Base Case:**\n- For \\(k = 1\\), \\(a_2 = O\\) (palindrome).\n\n**Inductive Step:**\nAssume \\(a_{2k}\\) is a palindrome for some \\(k \\geq 1\\).

However, the structure of \\(a_{2k+1}\\) is:\n\\[ a_{2k+1} = a_{2k} \\text{ followed by } a_{2k-1} \\]\n\nThus:\n\\[ a_{2k+2} = (a_{2k} \\text{ followed by } a_{2k-1}) \\text{ followed by } a_{2k} \\]\n\nThis can be rewritten as:\n\\[ a_{2k+2} = a_{2k} \\text{ followed by } a_{2k-1} \\text{ followed by } a_{2k} \\]\n\nSince \\(a_{2k}\\) is a palindrome, the sequence \\(a_{2k} \\text{ followed by } a_{2k-1} \\text{ followed by } a_{2k}\\) is a palindrome. Therefore, \\(a_{2k+2}\\) is a palindrome.\n\nBy induction, \\(a_{2k}\\) is a palindrome for all \\(k \\geq 1\\).\n\n### Step 4: Count the Palindromes\nSince the palindromes occur at even indices, we need to count the even indices up to 1000:\n\\[ 2, 4, 6, \\ldots, 1000 \\]\n\nThis is an arithmetic sequence with the first term 2 and common difference 2.

We can break this down by considering the contribution of each bit position to the total count.\n\n### Step 5: Contribution of Each Bit Position\nFor each bit position \\( i \\) (where \\( i \\) ranges from 1 to 7), we count how many times a pair of consecutive 1's can occur at positions \\( (i, i+1) \\).\n\n- For each pair \\( (i, i+1) \\), the bit at position \\( i \\) must be 1, and the bit at position \\( i+1 \\) must also be 1.\n- The remaining bits can be any combination of 0's and 1's.\n\n### Step 6: Calculating the Contribution\nFor each pair \\( (i, i+1) \\):\n- There are \\( 2^{8-2} = 2^6 = 64 \\) ways to choose the remaining 6 bits.\n- There are 7 possible pairs \\( (i, i+1) \\) for \\( i = 1, 2, \\ldots, 7 \\).\n\nThus, the total contribution of pairs of consecutive 1's is:\n\\[\n7 \\times 64 = 448\n\\]\n\n### Step 7: Final Answer\nThe sum of \\( C(n) \\) for all \\( n \\) from 1 to 256 is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{448}\n\\]"], "id": 2672, "generated_answers": ["448"], "gold_answer": "448", "is_correct": true, "answers_correctness": [true]}

The number of ways to choose 5 digits from 10 is given by the binomial coefficient:\n\\[\n\\binom{10}{5} = 252\n\\]\n\n### Step 2: Arrange the chosen digits to satisfy \\(M > A > R\\) and \\(R < T < Y\\)\nOnce we have chosen 5 digits, we need to assign them to the positions \\(M, A, R, T, Y\\) such that \\(M > A > R\\) and \\(R < T < Y\\).\n\n#### Step 2.1: Assign \\(M, A, R\\)\nWe need to choose 3 digits out of the 5 to be \\(M, A, R\\) such that \\(M > A > R\\). The number of ways to choose 3 digits from 5 and arrange them in decreasing order is:\n\\[\n\\binom{5}{3} = 10\n\\]\n\n#### Step 2.2: Assign \\(T, Y\\)\nThe remaining 2 digits will be assigned to \\(T\\) and \\(Y\\) such that \\(R < T < Y\\). The number of ways to choose 2 digits from the remaining 2 and arrange them in increasing order is:\n\\[\n\\binom{2}{2} = 1\n\\]\n\n### Step 3: Combine the choices\nTo find the total number of valid five-digit integers, we multiply the number of ways to choose the digits by the number of ways to arrange them:\n\\[\n\\binom{10}{5} \\times \\binom{5}{3} \\times \\binom{2}{2} = 252 \\times 10 \\times 1 = 2520\n\\]\n\n### Step 4: Adjust for the leading digit constraint\nSince \\(M\\) is the leading digit, it cannot be 0. We need to subtract the cases where 0 is chosen as \\(M\\).\n\n#### Step 4.1: Choose 5 digits including 0\nIf 0 is one of the chosen digits, we need to choose 4 more digits from the remaining 9 digits. The number of ways to choose 4 digits from 9 is:\n\\[\n\\binom{9}{4} = 126\n\\]\n\n#### Step 4.2: Assign \\(M, A, R\\) with 0 included\nWe need to choose 3 digits out of the 4 to be \\(M, A, R\\) such that \\(M > A > R\\) and \\(M \\neq 0\\). The number of ways to choose 3 digits from 4 and arrange them in decreasing order is:\n\\[\n\\binom{4}{3} = 4\n\\]\n\n#### Step 4.3: Assign \\(T, Y\\)\nThe remaining 1 digit will be assigned to \\(T\\) and \\(Y\\) such that \\(R < T < Y\\). The number of ways to choose 1 digit from the remaining 1 and arrange it in increasing order is:\n\\[\n\\binom{1}{1} = 1\n\\]\n\n#### Step 4.4: Combine the choices\nTo find the number of valid five-digit integers with 0 as \\(M\\), we multiply the number of ways to choose the digits by the number of ways to arrange them:\n\\[\n\\binom{9}{4} \\times \\binom{4}{3} \\times \\binom{1}{1} = 126 \\times 4 \\times 1 = 504\n\\]\n\n### Step 5: Subtract the invalid cases\nFinally, we subtract the number of invalid cases (where 0 is the leading digit) from the total number of valid cases:\n\\[\n2520 - 504 = 2016\n\\]\n\nThus, the number of five-digit integers \\(\\underline{M} \\underline{A} \\underline{R} \\underline{T} \\underline{Y}\\) with all digits distinct, such that \\(M > A > R\\) and \\(R < T < Y\\), is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{2016}\n\\]"], "id": 2981, "generated_answers": ["2016"], "gold_answer": "1512", "is_correct": false, "answers_correctness": [false]}

Each minute, she must flip exactly $k$ different light switches (to \"flip\" a switch means to turn it on if it is currently off, and off if it is currently on). At the end of each minute, if all of the switches are on, then the door unlocks and Elizabeth escapes from the room.\n\nLet $E(n, k)$ be the minimum number of minutes required for Elizabeth to escape, for positive integers $n, k$ with $k \\leq n$. For example, $E(2,1)=2$ because Elizabeth cannot escape in one minute (there are two switches and one must be flipped every minute) but she can escape in two minutes (by flipping Switch 1 in the first minute and Switch 2 in the second minute). Define $E(n, k)=\\infty$ if the puzzle is impossible to solve (that is, if it is impossible to have all switches on at the end of any minute).\n\nFor convenience, assume the $n$ light switches are numbered 1 through $n$.\nOne might guess that in most cases, $E(n, k) \\approx \\frac{n}{k}$.

Compute the number of noncongruent triangles that can be formed in this manner.", "generated_responses": ["To solve the problem of finding the number of noncongruent triangles that can be formed by extending three sides of a regular 16-gon, we need to follow a systematic approach. Let's break it down step by step.\n\n### Step 1: Understanding the Problem\nA regular 16-gon has 16 vertices and 16 sides. We need to extend three of these sides to form a triangle. The vertices of the triangle must not lie on the 16-gon itself.\n\n### Step 2: Identifying the Sides\nLabel the vertices of the 16-gon as \\( A_1, A_2, \\ldots, A_{16} \\). Each side of the 16-gon can be represented as \\( A_iA_{i+1} \\) (with \\( A_{17} \\) being \\( A_1 \\)).\n\n### Step 3: Extending the Sides\nTo form a triangle, we need to extend three sides. Let's denote the sides we extend as \\( A_iA_{i+1} \\), \\( A_jA_{j+1} \\), and \\( A_kA_{k+1} \\) where \\( i, j, k \\) are distinct indices.\n\n### Step 4: Ensuring Non-Collinearity\nFor the extensions to form a triangle, the points where the extensions intersect must be distinct and not lie on the 16-gon. This means the extensions must not be parallel and must intersect outside the 16-gon.\n\n### Step 5: Counting Noncongruent Triangles\nTo count the number of noncongruent triangles, we need to consider the relative positions of the sides \\( A_iA_{i+1} \\), \\( A_jA_{j+1} \\), and \\( A_kA_{k+1} \\). The key is to ensure that the triangle formed is unique up to congruence.\n\n### Step 6: Using Symmetry\nThe 16-gon has rotational symmetry of order 16. Therefore, we can fix one side and count the number of ways to choose the other two sides such that the resulting triangle is noncongruent.\n\n### Step 7: Fixing One Side\nFix one side, say \\( A_1A_2 \\). We need to choose two other sides from the remaining 15 sides such that the extensions form a noncongruent triangle.\n\n### Step 8: Counting Valid Pairs\nWe need to count the number of ways to choose two sides from the remaining 15 sides such that the extensions form a noncongruent triangle. This is equivalent to choosing 2 sides from 15, which is given by the binomial coefficient \\( \\binom{15}{2} \\).\n\n\\[\n\\binom{15}{2} = \\frac{15 \\times 14}{2 \\times 1} = 105\n\\]\n\n### Step 9: Adjusting for Congruence\nHowever, not all of these pairs will form noncongruent triangles. We need to consider the rotational symmetry of the 16-gon. Each set of three sides can be rotated in 16 different ways, but only one of these rotations will form a noncongruent triangle.\n\n### Step 10: Final Calculation\nTo find the number of noncongruent triangles, we divide the total number of pairs by 16:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{105}{16} = 6.5625\n\\]\n\nSince the number of noncongruent triangles must be an integer, we need to re-evaluate our approach.
