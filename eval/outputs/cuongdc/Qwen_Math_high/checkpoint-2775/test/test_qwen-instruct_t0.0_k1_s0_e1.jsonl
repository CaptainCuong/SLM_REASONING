{"question": "If $f(x)$ is a polynomial of degree 7, and $g(x)$ is a polynomial of degree 7, then what is the product of the minimum and the maximum possible degrees of $f(x) + g(x)$?", "generated_responses": ["To determine the product of the minimum and maximum possible degrees of \\( f(x) + g(x) \\) where \\( f(x) \\) and \\( g(x) \\) are both polynomials of degree 7, we need to analyze the degrees of the resulting polynomial \\( f(x) + g(x) \\).\n\n### Step 1: Maximum Possible Degree\nThe maximum possible degree of \\( f(x) + g(x) \\) occurs when the leading terms of \\( f(x) \\) and \\( g(x) \\) do not cancel each other out. Since both \\( f(x) \\) and \\( g(x) \\) are polynomials of degree 7, the leading term of \\( f(x) \\) is \\( a_7 x^7 \\) and the leading term of \\( g(x) \\) is \\( b_7 x^7 \\). If \\( a_7 \\neq -b_7 \\), the leading term of \\( f(x) + g(x) \\) will be \\( (a_7 + b_7) x^7 \\), which is a polynomial of degree 7. Therefore, the maximum possible degree of \\( f(x) + g(x) \\) is 7.\n\n### Step 2: Minimum Possible Degree\nThe minimum possible degree of \\( f(x) + g(x) \\) occurs when the leading terms of \\( f(x) \\) and \\( g(x) \\) exactly cancel each other out. In this case, the leading term of \\( f(x) + g(x) \\) will be zero, and the resulting polynomial will have a degree less than 7. The minimum degree of \\( f(x) + g(x) \\) is 0, which occurs when \\( f(x) + g(x) \\) is a constant polynomial (i.e., all terms cancel out).\n\n### Step 3: Product of the Minimum and Maximum Degrees\nThe minimum possible degree of \\( f(x) + g(x) \\) is 0, and the maximum possible degree of \\( f(x) + g(x) \\) is 7. Therefore, the product of the minimum and maximum possible degrees is:\n\\[\n0 \\times 7 = 0\n\\]\n\nThus, the final answer is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{0}\n\\]"], "id": "1", "generated_answers": ["0"], "gold_answer": "0", "is_correct": true, "answers_correctness": [true]}
