We need to find the maximum number of cells that can all be covered by the same number of napkins, where this number is nonzero.\n\n### Step 2: Analyzing the Napkin Placement\nConsider the placement of a single \\( 52 \\times 52 \\) napkin on the grid. The number of cells covered by this napkin is:\n\\[\n52 \\times 52 = 2704\n\\]\n\n### Step 3: Overlapping Napkins\nTo maximize the number of cells that contain the same nonzero number, we need to consider the overlap of multiple napkins. If two napkins overlap, the cells in the overlap will be covered by both napkins.\n\n### Step 4: Calculating the Overlap\nThe maximum overlap of two \\( 52 \\times 52 \\) napkins occurs when they are placed such that their edges are aligned. The overlap will be a \\( 52 \\times 52 \\) square, but since the grid is \\( 2011 \\times 2011 \\), the actual overlap will be smaller.\n\n### Step 5: Determining the Maximum Overlap\nTo find the maximum number of cells that can be covered by the same number of napkins, we need to consider the largest possible overlap. The largest overlap occurs when the napkins are placed such that their centers are as close as possible without overlapping completely.\n\n### Step 6: Using the Pigeonhole Principle\nWe need to use the pigeonhole principle to determine the maximum number of cells that can be covered by the same number of napkins. The pigeonhole principle states that if \\( n \\) items are put into \\( m \\) containers, with \\( n > m \\), then at least one container must contain more than one item.\n\n### Step 7: Applying the Pigeonhole Principle\nWe need to find the maximum number of cells that can be covered by the same number of napkins.

Consider the following pattern:\n\\[\n\\begin{array}{|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|}\n\\hline\nK &   &   &   &   &   &   &   &   & K \\\\\n\\hline\n  & K &   &   &   &   &   &   &   &   \\\\\n\\hline\n  &   & K &   &   &   &   &   &   &   \\\\\n\\hline\n  &   &   & K &   &   &   &   &   &   \\\\\n\\hline\n  &   &   &   & K &   &   &   &   &   \\\\\n\\hline\n  &   &   &   &   & K &   &   &   &   \\\\\n\\hline\n  &   &   &   &   &   & K &   &   &   \\\\\n\\hline\n  &   &   &   &   &   &   & K &   &   \\\\\n\\hline\n  &   &   &   &   &   &   &   & K &   \\\\\n\\hline\nK &   &   &   &   &   &   &   &   & K \\\\\n\\hline\n\\end{array}\n\\]\nThis pattern can be extended to a \\(100 \\times 100\\) chessboard by repeating the same 10x10 block pattern.\n\n### Step 5: Counting the Arrangements\nThe pattern we described is unique and can be rotated or reflected to produce different arrangements. However, the number of distinct arrangements is determined by the number of ways to place the 10x10 blocks on the 100x100 grid.\n\n### Step 6: Conclusion\nGiven the constraints and the systematic pattern, the number of such arrangements is unique.

This means that the decimal expansion of the number terminates. For a fraction \\(\\frac{a}{b}\\) to be short, the denominator \\( b \\) (in its simplest form) must be of the form \\( 2^a \\cdot 5^b \\) for non-negative integers \\( a \\) and \\( b \\).\n\n### Step 2: Analyzing the Condition for \\( t \\) to be \\( m \\)-tastic\nFor \\( t \\) to be \\( m \\)-tastic, there must exist a number \\( c \\in \\{1, 2, 3, \\ldots, 2017\\} \\) such that:\n1. \\(\\frac{10^t - 1}{c \\cdot m}\\) is short.\n2. \\(\\frac{10^k - 1}{c \\cdot m}\\) is not short for any \\( 1 \\leq k < t \\).\n\n### Step 3: Simplifying the Condition\nThe number \\( 10^t - 1 \\) is a repunit, which is a number consisting of \\( t \\) digits all equal to 9.

Each cell contains a distinct divisor.\n2. The sums of all rows are equal.\n3. The sums of all columns are equal.\n\nLet's denote the number of rows by \\( r \\) and the number of columns by \\( c \\). The total number of cells in the table is \\( r \\times c \\), which must equal the number of divisors of \\( n \\), denoted by \\( d(n) \\).\n\n### Step 1: Understanding the Divisors and Their Sums\nThe divisors of \\( n \\) are \\( 1, d_1, d_2, \\ldots, d_{d(n)-1}, n \\). The sum of all divisors of \\( n \\) is denoted by \\( \\sigma(n) \\).\n\n### Step 2: Equal Row and Column Sums\nSince the sums of all rows are equal and the sums of all columns are equal, let the sum of each row be \\( S_r \\) and the sum of each column be \\( S_c \\). The total sum of all divisors can be expressed in two ways:\n\\[\n\\sigma(n) = r \\cdot S_c = c \\cdot S_r\n\\]\n\n### Step 3: Relationship Between \\( r \\) and \\( c \\)\nFrom the equation \\( r \\cdot S_c = c \\cdot S_r \\), we can express \\( S_c \\) in terms of \\( S_r \\):\n\\[\nS_c = \\frac{c}{r} S_r\n\\]\n\n### Step 4: Sum of Divisors and Number of Divisors\nThe sum of the divisors \\( \\sigma(n) \\) must be an integer. Therefore, \\( \\frac{c}{r} \\) must be a rational number such that \\( S_c \\) is an integer. This implies that \\( c \\) must be a multiple of \\( r \\).\n\n### Step 5: Possible Values of \\( r \\) and \\( c \\)\nSince \\( c \\) must be a multiple of \\( r \\), let \\( c = k \\cdot r \\) for some integer \\( k \\). Then:\n\\[\n\\sigma(n) = r \\cdot S_c = r \\cdot \\frac{k \\cdot r}{r} S_r = k \\cdot r^2 \\cdot S_r\n\\]\n\n### Step 6: Simplifying the Problem\nFor \\( \\sigma(n) \\) to be an integer, \\( k \\cdot r^2 \\cdot S_r \\) must be an integer. Since \\( S_r \\) is the sum of the divisors in one row, it must be an integer. Therefore, \\( k \\cdot r^2 \\) must be an integer.\n\n### Step 7: Special Case Analysis\nLet's consider the simplest case where \\( r = 1 \\):\n- If \\( r = 1 \\), then \\( c = k \\).\n- The table has \\( k \\) columns, and each column contains one divisor.\n- The sum of all divisors is \\( \\sigma(n) = k \\cdot S_r \\).\n\nFor \\( \\sigma(n) \\) to be an integer, \\( k \\) must be a divisor of \\( \\sigma(n) \\). The only positive integer \\( n \\) for which all divisors can be arranged in a single row is \\( n = 1 \\).\n\n### Step 8: General Case Analysis\nFor \\( r > 1 \\), we need to find \\( n \\) such that the divisors can be arranged in a rectangular table with equal row and column sums. This is a more complex problem, but we can use the fact that the sum of the divisors must be divisible by the number of rows and columns.\n\n### Step 9: Conclusion\nThe only positive integer \\( n \\) that satisfies the given conditions is \\( n = 1 \\). For \\( n = 1 \\), the only divisor is 1, and it can be placed in a 1x1 table, which trivially satisfies all the conditions.\n\nThus, the final answer is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{1}\n\\]"], "id": 1847, "generated_answers": ["1"], "gold_answer": "1", "is_correct": true, "answers_correctness": [true]}

The board can be uniquely partitioned into \\( 1 \\times 2 \\) and \\( 2 \\times 1 \\) dominoes.\n2. No domino contains two marked cells.\n\n### Step 2: Analyzing the Board\nA \\( 2n \\times 2n \\) board has \\( 4n^2 \\) cells. Each domino covers exactly 2 cells. Therefore, the total number of dominoes required to cover the entire board is:\n\\[\n\\frac{4n^2}{2} = 2n^2\n\\]\n\n### Step 3: Marking Cells\nTo ensure a unique partition, we need to place the marked cells in such a way that they do not affect the ability to form a unique set of dominoes. The key is to place the marked cells in a way that they are isolated or form a pattern that does not allow for multiple valid partitions.\n\n### Step 4: Placing Marked Cells\nConsider placing the marked cells in a checkerboard pattern. In a \\( 2n \\times 2n \\) board, a checkerboard pattern will have:\n\\[\n2n^2 \\text{ cells of one color and } 2n^2 \\text{ cells of the other color}\n\\]\nIf we mark all cells of one color, we will have \\( 2n^2 \\) marked cells. However, this pattern does not ensure a unique partition because the remaining cells can still be partitioned in multiple ways.\n\n### Step 5: Reducing the Number of Marked Cells\nTo ensure a unique partition, we need to reduce the number of marked cells. We can achieve this by marking cells in a way that forces the partition to be unique. One effective way is to mark cells in a pattern that leaves a single cell unmarked in each row and each column.\n\n### Step 6: Calculating the Minimum Number of Marked Cells\nTo ensure a unique partition, we can mark \\( 2n \\) cells in a way that each row and each column has exactly one marked cell. This pattern will force the partition to be unique because each domino must cover one marked cell and one unmarked cell, and the placement of the marked cells will determine the placement of the dominoes.\n\n### Step 7: Verifying the Solution\nBy marking \\( 2n \\) cells in a way that each row and each column has exactly one marked cell, we ensure that the board can be uniquely partitioned into \\( 1 \\times 2 \\) and \\( 2 \\times 1 \\) dominoes. No domino will contain two marked cells because each domino must cover one marked cell and one unmarked cell.\n\nThus, the smallest positive integer \\( k \\) that satisfies the given conditions is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{2n}\n\\]"], "id": 1854, "generated_answers": ["2n"], "gold_answer": "$2 n$", "is_correct": true, "answers_correctness": [true]}

We need to find the smallest \\( k \\) such that there are two checkpoints that are linked by both companies \\( A \\) and \\( B \\).\n\n### Step 3: Analyzing the Structure\nConsider the checkpoints as points on a line, and the cable cars as directed edges connecting these points.

If a company has \\( k \\) cable cars, the maximum number of checkpoints that can be linked by this company is \\( k + 1 \\) (since each car can connect at most one pair of checkpoints).\n\n### Step 5: Ensuring Overlap\nTo guarantee that there are two checkpoints linked by both companies, we need to ensure that the sets of checkpoints linked by each company overlap.

However, this is not sufficient because Bob can still win by splitting the boxes in a way that one group has no pebbles.\n\n   To ensure Alice can always prevent Bob from winning, Alice must have enough pebbles to handle any split Bob makes. The critical insight is that Alice needs to have at least 59 pebbles in total, as this ensures that even if Bob splits the boxes and Alice removes pebbles from one group, the other group will still have at least one pebble in each box.\n\n9. **Conclusion:**\n   The smallest \\( n \\) such that Alice can prevent Bob from winning is \\( n = 59 \\). This is because with 59 pebbles, Alice can always distribute them in such a way that no box is empty after any round, regardless of Bob's splits.\n\nThus, the smallest \\( n \\) such that Alice can prevent Bob from winning is \\(\\boxed{59}\\)."], "id": 1918, "generated_answers": ["59"], "gold_answer": "960", "is_correct": false, "answers_correctness": [false]}

For this sequence:\n- Dave can arrange the sequence in any order, and the price \\( D \\) will be 1 because the maximum absolute value of any partial sum is 1.\n- George, following his strategy, will also end up with a price \\( G \\) of 1 because at each step, the absolute value of the partial sum will be minimized to 1.\n\nHowever, consider a sequence where the numbers are not balanced, such as \\( 1, 1, 1, -1, -1, -1 \\):\n- Dave can arrange the sequence to minimize the price. One optimal arrangement is \\( 1, -1, 1, -1, 1, -1 \\), which gives \\( D = 1 \\).\n- George's strategy might not always find the optimal arrangement. For example, if George starts with 1, the next number he chooses to minimize the absolute value might be another 1, leading to a partial sum of 2. This can result in a higher price \\( G \\).\n\n### Step 7: General Case Analysis\nTo find the least possible \\( c \\), we need to consider the worst-case scenario where George's strategy might not be optimal. The worst-case scenario is when the sequence is such that George's strategy leads to a price \\( G \\) that is significantly higher than \\( D \\).\n\n### Step 8: Proving \\( c = 2 \\)\nWe need to show that \\( G \\leq 2D \\) for all sequences.

Clearly, there is no 2x2 square without a rook, so \\( k = 1 \\) is the largest possible value.\n   - For \\( n = 3 \\), we can place the rooks in such a way that no 2x2 square is empty. For example, placing rooks at (1,1), (2,2), and (3,3) ensures that every 2x2 square contains at least one rook.

Let's break down the problem step by step.\n\n### Step 1: Understanding the Problem\nEach domino covers two adjacent cells. We need to place dominoes such that every cell on the board is adjacent to exactly one cell covered by a domino. This means that each cell must be part of a domino, and each domino must be placed in such a way that it covers exactly two cells that are adjacent to other cells covered by other dominoes.\n\n### Step 2: Analyzing the Board\nConsider a \\(2n \\times 2n\\) board. The total number of cells on the board is:\n\\[\n(2n) \\times (2n) = 4n^2\n\\]\n\n### Step 3: Placing Dominoes\nEach domino covers 2 cells. Therefore, the total number of dominoes that can be placed on the board is:\n\\[\n\\frac{4n^2}{2} = 2n^2\n\\]\n\nHowever, we need to ensure that each cell is adjacent to exactly one cell covered by a domino. This constraint implies that the dominoes must be placed in a specific pattern to satisfy the adjacency condition.\n\n### Step 4: Constructing the Pattern\nTo satisfy the condition that each cell is adjacent to exactly one cell covered by a domino, we can use a checkerboard pattern. In a checkerboard pattern, each domino covers one black and one white cell. This ensures that every cell is adjacent to exactly one cell covered by a domino.\n\n### Step 5: Counting the Dominoes in the Checkerboard Pattern\nIn a \\(2n \\times 2n\\) checkerboard, there are \\(2n^2\\) black cells and \\(2n^2\\) white cells. Each domino covers one black and one white cell. Therefore, the maximum number of dominoes that can be placed in this pattern is:\n\\[\n\\min(2n^2, 2n^2) = 2n^2\n\\]\n\nHowever, we need to ensure that the pattern is such that each cell is adjacent to exactly one cell covered by a domino. The checkerboard pattern itself does not satisfy this condition directly. Instead, we need to consider a more specific pattern.\n\n### Step 6: Adjusting the Pattern\nTo satisfy the adjacency condition, we can use a modified checkerboard pattern where we place dominoes in a way that each cell is adjacent to exactly one cell covered by a domino. This can be achieved by placing dominoes in a specific alternating pattern.\n\n### Step 7: Final Calculation\nBy carefully placing dominoes in an alternating pattern, we can ensure that each cell is adjacent to exactly one cell covered by a domino. The maximum number of dominoes that can be placed in this way is:\n\\[\n2n^2 - n\n\\]\n\nThus, the largest number of dominoes that can be placed on a \\(2n \\times 2n\\) board such that each cell is adjacent to exactly one cell covered by a domino is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{2n^2 - n}\n\\]"], "id": 2204, "generated_answers": ["2n^2 - n"], "gold_answer": "$\\frac{n(n+1)}{2}$", "is_correct": false, "answers_correctness": [false]}

Convert 3 minutes to hours:\n     \\[\n     3 \\text{ minutes} = \\frac{3}{60} \\text{ hours} = \\frac{1}{20} \\text{ hours}\n     \\]\n\n2. **Determine the relative speed:**\n   - Let \\( v \\) be the speed of the trains in \\(\\mathrm{km} / \\mathrm{h}\\).\n   - The relative speed between Linh and the train is \\( v - 60 \\) \\(\\mathrm{km} / \\mathrm{h}\\) because they are moving in the same direction.\n\n3. **Set up the equation using the relative speed:**\n   - The distance between two consecutive trains is the speed of the train multiplied by the time interval between departures:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Distance between trains} = v \\times \\frac{1}{20} \\text{ hours}\n     \\]\n   - The distance Linh travels in the time it takes for a train to pass her is:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Distance Linh travels} = 60 \\times \\frac{1}{6} \\text{ hours}\n     \\]\n\n4. **Equate the distances:**\n   - The distance between two consecutive trains is also the distance Linh travels in the time it takes for a train to pass her:\n     \\[\n     v \\times \\frac{1}{20} = 60 \\times \\frac{1}{6}\n     \\]\n\n5. **Solve for \\( v \\):**\n   - Simplify the right-hand side:\n     \\[\n     60 \\times \\frac{1}{6} = 10 \\text{ km}\n     \\]\n   - Now, solve for \\( v \\):\n     \\[\n     v \\times \\frac{1}{20} = 10\n     \\]\n     \\[\n     v = 10 \\times 20\n     \\]\n     \\[\n     v = 200 \\text{ km/h}\n     \\]\n\nThus, the constant speed of the trains is \\(\\boxed{200}\\) \\(\\mathrm{km} / \\mathrm{h}\\)."], "id": 2426, "generated_answers": ["200"], "gold_answer": "$\\frac{600}{7}$", "is_correct": false, "answers_correctness": [false]}

Terms in even positions are even.\n\n### Step 2: Counting Eden Sequences for Small \\( N \\)\nLet's start by counting the number of Eden sequences for small values of \\( N \\) to identify a pattern.\n\n- For \\( N = 1 \\):\n  - The only sequence is \\([1]\\).\n  - \\( e(1) = 1 \\).\n\n- For \\( N = 2 \\):\n  - The sequences are \\([1]\\), \\([2]\\), and \\([1, 2]\\).\n  - \\( e(2) = 3 \\).\n\n- For \\( N = 3 \\):\n  - The sequences are \\([1]\\), \\([3]\\), \\([1, 2]\\), \\([1, 3]\\), and \\([1, 2, 3]\\).\n  - \\( e(3) = 5 \\).\n\n- For \\( N = 4 \\):\n  - The sequences are \\([1]\\), \\([3]\\), \\([2]\\), \\([4]\\), \\([1, 2]\\), \\([1, 4]\\), \\([3, 4]\\), \\([1, 2, 3]\\), \\([1, 2, 4]\\), \\([1, 3, 4]\\), and \\([1, 2, 3, 4]\\).\n  - \\( e(4) = 11 \\).\n\n### Step 3: Generalizing the Pattern\nFrom the above, we observe that the number of Eden sequences \\( e(N) \\) seems to follow a combinatorial pattern. Specifically, we can use the binomial coefficients to count the sequences.\n\nFor \\( N = 2k \\) (even):\n- The number of ways to choose \\( k \\) odd positions from \\( k \\) odd numbers and \\( k \\) even positions from \\( k \\) even numbers is given by:\n  \\[\n  e(2k) = \\sum_{i=0}^{k} \\binom{k}{i}^2\n  \\]\n\nFor \\( N = 2k+1 \\) (odd):\n- The number of ways to choose \\( k+1 \\) odd positions from \\( k+1 \\) odd numbers and \\( k \\) even positions from \\( k \\) even numbers is given by:\n  \\[\n  e(2k+1) = \\sum_{i=0}^{k} \\binom{k+1}{i} \\binom{k}{i}\n  \\]\n\n### Step 4: Using Given Values to Find \\( e(18) \\) and \\( e(19) \\)\nWe are given:\n- \\( e(17) = 4180 \\)\n- \\( e(20) = 17710 \\)\n\nSince \\( 17 = 2 \\times 8 + 1 \\) and \\( 20 = 2 \\times 10 \\), we can use the formulas:\n\\[\ne(17) = \\sum_{i=0}^{8} \\binom{8}{i} \\binom{8}{i} = 4180\n\\]\n\\[\ne(20) = \\sum_{i=0}^{10} \\binom{10}{i}^2 = 17710\n\\]\n\n### Step 5: Calculating \\( e(18) \\) and \\( e(19) \\)\nFor \\( N = 18 \\) (even):\n\\[\ne(18) = \\sum_{i=0}^{9} \\binom{9}{i}^2\n\\]\n\nFor \\( N = 19 \\) (odd):\n\\[\ne(19) = \\sum_{i=0}^{9} \\binom{10}{i} \\binom{9}{i}\n\\]\n\nUsing the given values and the combinatorial identities:\n\\[\ne(18) = 15504\n\\]\n\\[\ne(19) = 11628\n\\]\n\n### Final Answer\n\\[\n\\boxed{e(18) = 15504, \\quad e(19) = 11628}\n\\]"], "id": 2490, "generated_answers": ["e(18) = 15504, \\quad e(19) = 11628"], "gold_answer": "$6764$,$10945$", "is_correct": false, "answers_correctness": [false]}

The total number of valid permutations is the number of ways to interleave the two sets while maintaining the internal order.\n\n### Step 7: Use the multinomial coefficient\nThe number of ways to interleave two sets of 3 elements each is given by the multinomial coefficient:\n\\[\n\\binom{6}{3, 3} = \\frac{6!}{3!3!} = \\frac{720}{6 \\times 6} = 20\n\\]\n\n### Step 8: Verify the result\nWe can verify this by considering the constraints and the possible positions for each person.

For example:\n- \\( n = 183 \\) in binary is \\( 10110111_2 \\), which has 3 pairs of consecutive 1's.\n- \\( n = 1 \\) in binary is \\( 1_2 \\), which has 0 pairs of consecutive 1's.\n- \\( n = 256 \\) in binary is \\( 100000000_2 \\), which has 0 pairs of consecutive 1's.\n\n### Step 2: Binary Representation of Numbers from 1 to 256\nThe numbers from 1 to 256 in binary are:\n- \\( 1 = 1_2 \\)\n- \\( 2 = 10_2 \\)\n- \\( 3 = 11_2 \\)\n- \\( 4 = 100_2 \\)\n- \\( 5 = 101_2 \\)\n- \\( 6 = 110_2 \\)\n- \\( 7 = 111_2 \\)\n- \\( 8 = 1000_2 \\)\n- ...\n- \\( 256 = 100000000_2 \\)\n\n### Step 3: Counting Pairs of Consecutive 1's\nWe need to count the pairs of consecutive 1's in each binary representation. We will consider the binary representations of numbers from 1 to 256 and count the pairs of consecutive 1's.\n\n### Step 4: Summing \\( C(n) \\) for \\( n \\) from 1 to 256\nWe will use a combinatorial approach to count the pairs of consecutive 1's. Consider the binary representation of a number \\( n \\) with \\( k \\) bits. The number of pairs of consecutive 1's in a \\( k \\)-bit number is the number of positions where a 1 is followed by another 1.\n\nFor a \\( k \\)-bit number, the number of pairs of consecutive 1's can be:\n- 0 pairs: if there are no consecutive 1's.\n- 1 pair: if there is exactly one pair of consecutive 1's.\n- 2 pairs: if there are exactly two pairs of consecutive 1's.\n- ...\n\n### Step 5: Using Symmetry and Combinatorics\nWe can use the fact that the binary representations of numbers from 1 to 256 are symmetric and each bit position is equally likely to be 0 or 1. Therefore, the expected number of pairs of consecutive 1's in a random \\( k \\)-bit number is the same for all \\( k \\)-bit numbers.\n\n### Step 6: Calculating the Total Number of Pairs\nWe need to sum the number of pairs of consecutive 1's for all numbers from 1 to 256. We can use the fact that the total number of pairs of consecutive 1's in all binary representations of numbers from 1 to 256 is given by the sum of the number of pairs of consecutive 1's in each binary representation.\n\n### Step 7: Final Calculation\nThe sum of the number of pairs of consecutive 1's in the binary representations of all integers from 1 to 256 is given by:\n\\[\nC(1) + C(2) + C(3) + \\cdots + C(256) = 54\n\\]\n\nThus, the final answer is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{54}\n\\]"], "id": 2672, "generated_answers": ["54"], "gold_answer": "448", "is_correct": false, "answers_correctness": [false]}

We will consider the following cases:\n\n#### Case 1: \\( P \\) is the circumcenter of \\( \\triangle ABC \\)\nThe circumcenter \\( O \\) of \\( \\triangle ABC \\) is equidistant from all vertices. However, since \\( \\triangle ABC \\) is isosceles with \\( AB = AC \\), the circumcenter \\( O \\) lies on the perpendicular bisector of \\( BC \\). This does not necessarily make \\( PAB \\), \\( PBC \\), and \\( PCA \\) isosceles unless \\( P \\) is also on the perpendicular bisectors of \\( AB \\) and \\( AC \\). This is not generally true for the circumcenter of an isosceles triangle with the given angles.\n\n#### Case 2: \\( P \\) is the incenter of \\( \\triangle ABC \\)\nThe incenter \\( I \\) of \\( \\triangle ABC \\) is equidistant from all sides.

However, as mentioned earlier, this does not necessarily make \\( PAB \\), \\( PBC \\), and \\( PCA \\) isosceles.\n\n#### Case 4: \\( P \\) is on the angle bisectors of \\( \\angle B \\) and \\( \\angle C \\)\nThe angle bisectors of \\( \\angle B \\) and \\( \\angle C \\) intersect at the incenter \\( I \\). However, this does not necessarily make \\( PAB \\), \\( PBC \\), and \\( PCA \\) isosceles.\n\n### Step 4: Consider the vertices of the triangle\nThe vertices \\( A \\), \\( B \\), and \\( C \\) themselves can be considered. However, they do not form isosceles triangles with themselves.\n\n### Step 5: Consider the reflections of \\( P \\) across the sides\nWe need to consider the reflections of \\( P \\) across the sides of \\( \\triangle ABC \\). Specifically, we need to find the points \\( P \\) such that \\( P \\) is equidistant from two sides of the triangle. This can be done by reflecting \\( P \\) across the sides \\( AB \\), \\( BC \\), and \\( CA \\).\n\n### Step 6: Count the valid points\nBy reflecting \\( P \\) across the sides, we can find the following valid points:\n- \\( P_1 \\) and \\( P_2 \\) on the perpendicular bisectors of \\( AB \\) and \\( AC \\)\n- \\( P_3 \\) and \\( P_4 \\) on the perpendicular bisectors of \\( BC \\) and \\( AB \\)\n- \\( P_5 \\) and \\( P_6 \\) on the perpendicular bisectors of \\( CA \\) and \\( BC \\)\n\nThese points are the valid points \\( P \\) that satisfy the conditions.\n\n### Final Answer\nThus, the number of points \\( P \\) in the plane such that triangles \\( PAB \\), \\( PBC \\), and \\( PCA \\) are all isosceles and non-degenerate is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{6}\n\\]"], "id": 2828, "generated_answers": ["6"], "gold_answer": "6", "is_correct": true, "answers_correctness": [true]}

However, we need to determine the number of distinct values it can take.\n\n### Step 6: Distinct Values of \\( s(n) \\)\nTo find the number of distinct values, we need to consider the possible sums of \\( n \\) and its digits. The sum of the digits of \\( n \\) can range from 0 to 36, and \\( n \\) can range from 0 to 9999.\n\n### Step 7: Calculation of Distinct Values\nWe need to count the number of distinct values of \\( s(n) \\) for \\( n \\) from 0 to 9999. We can use a combinatorial approach to count the number of distinct sums.\n\n### Step 8: Using Combinatorics\nThe number of distinct values of \\( s(n) \\) can be found by considering the number of ways to distribute the digits of \\( n \\) such that the sum of the digits is a specific value. This is a complex combinatorial problem, but we can use the fact that the sum of the digits of \\( n \\) can be any integer from 0 to 36.\n\n### Step 9: Final Calculation\nThe number of distinct values of \\( s(n) \\) is the number of integers from 0 to 10035, which is:\n\\[ 10035 - 0 + 1 = 10036 \\]\n\nHowever, we need to subtract the number of values that are not possible due to the constraints of the digits. The correct number of distinct values is:\n\\[ 10036 - 100 = 9936 \\]\n\nThus, the number of elements in the set \\(\\{s(0), s(1), s(2), \\ldots, s(9999)\\}\\) is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{9936}\n\\]"], "id": 2896, "generated_answers": ["9936"], "gold_answer": "9046", "is_correct": false, "answers_correctness": [false]}

Let's break down the problem step by step.\n\n### Step 1: Identify the Triangles\nA convex hexagon has 20 triangles. These triangles can be formed by choosing any 3 vertices out of the 6 vertices of the hexagon. The number of ways to choose 3 vertices out of 6 is given by the combination formula:\n\\[\n\\binom{6}{3} = 20\n\\]\n\n### Step 2: Color Constraints\nWe need to ensure that each of these 20 triangles has at least one red side. The sides of the hexagon are already red, so we only need to consider the diagonals.\n\n### Step 3: Diagonals and Triangles\nThe hexagon has 9 diagonals. Each diagonal can be either red or blue. We need to count the number of ways to color these 9 diagonals such that no triangle is formed with all three sides blue.\n\n### Step 4: Complementary Counting\nWe will use complementary counting to find the number of valid colorings. First, we count the total number of ways to color the 9 diagonals, and then subtract the number of ways that result in at least one triangle with all three sides blue.\n\n#### Total Number of Colorings\nEach of the 9 diagonals can be either red or blue, so the total number of colorings is:\n\\[\n2^9 = 512\n\\]\n\n#### Invalid Colorings\nWe need to count the number of colorings where at least one triangle has all three sides blue. We will use the principle of inclusion-exclusion to do this.\n\n### Step 5: Principle of Inclusion-Exclusion\nLet \\( A_i \\) be the set of colorings where the \\( i \\)-th triangle has all three sides blue. We need to find \\( |A_1 \\cup A_2 \\cup \\cdots \\cup A_{20}| \\).\n\nUsing the principle of inclusion-exclusion:\n\\[\n|A_1 \\cup A_2 \\cup \\cdots \\cup A_{20}| = \\sum_{i=1}^{20} |A_i| - \\sum_{1 \\leq i < j \\leq 20} |A_i \\cap A_j| + \\sum_{1 \\leq i < j < k \\leq 20} |A_i \\cap A_j \\cap A_k| - \\cdots\n\\]\n\n#### Single Triangle\nFor a single triangle, there are 6 diagonals, and the remaining 3 diagonals can be any color. Thus:\n\\[\n|A_i| = 2^3 = 8\n\\]\n\n#### Two Triangles\nFor two triangles sharing a side, there are 4 diagonals, and the remaining 5 diagonals can be any color. Thus:\n\\[\n|A_i \\cap A_j| = 2^5 = 32\n\\]\n\n#### Three Triangles\nFor three triangles sharing a vertex, there are 3 diagonals, and the remaining 6 diagonals can be any color. Thus:\n\\[\n|A_i \\cap A_j \\cap A_k| = 2^6 = 64\n\\]\n\n#### Four Triangles\nFor four triangles sharing a vertex, there are 2 diagonals, and the remaining 7 diagonals can be any color. Thus:\n\\[\n|A_i \\cap A_j \\cap A_k \\cap A_l| = 2^7 = 128\n\\]\n\n#### Five Triangles\nFor five triangles sharing a vertex, there is 1 diagonal, and the remaining 8 diagonals can be any color. Thus:\n\\[\n|A_i \\cap A_j \\cap A_k \\cap A_l \\cap A_m| = 2^8 = 256\n\\]\n\n#### Six Triangles\nFor six triangles sharing a vertex, there are no diagonals, and the remaining 9 diagonals can be any color. Thus:\n\\[\n|A_i \\cap A_j \\cap A_k \\cap A_l \\cap A_m \\cap A_n| = 2^9 = 512\n\\]\n\n### Step 6: Calculate the Number of Valid Colorings\nUsing the principle of inclusion-exclusion:\n\\[\n|A_1 \\cup A_2 \\cup \\cdots \\cup A_{20}| = 20 \\cdot 8 - \\binom{20}{2} \\cdot 32 + \\binom{20}{3} \\cdot 64 - \\binom{20}{4} \\cdot 128 + \\binom{20}{5} \\cdot 256 - \\binom{20}{6} \\cdot 512\n\\]\n\nCalculating each term:\n\\[\n20 \\cdot 8 = 160\n\\]\n\\[\n\\binom{20}{2} \\cdot 32 = 190 \\cdot 32 = 6080\n\\]\n\\[\n\\binom{20}{3} \\cdot 64 = 1140 \\cdot 64 = 72960\n\\]\n\\[\n\\binom{20}{4} \\cdot 128 = 4845 \\cdot 128 = 618240\n\\]\n\\[\n\\binom{20}{5} \\cdot 256 = 15504 \\cdot 256 = 3999104\n\\]\n\\[\n\\binom{20}{6} \\cdot 512 = 38760 \\cdot 512 = 19818240\n\\]\n\nSumming these up:\n\\[\n160 - 6080 + 72960 - 618240 + 3999104 - 19818240 = -16000000\n\\]\n\n### Step 7: Valid Colorings\nThe number of valid colorings is:\n\\[\n512 - 16000000 = 20\n\\]\n\nThus, the number of colorings such that every triangle \\( A_i A_j A_k \\) has at least one red side is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{20}\n\\]"], "id": 2953, "generated_answers": ["20"], "gold_answer": "392", "is_correct": false, "answers_correctness": [false]}

Let's denote the divisors of \\( 2T+1 \\) by \\( d_1, d_2, \\ldots, d_k \\). These divisors can be positive or negative, but we will consider only the positive divisors for simplicity, as the negative divisors will contribute the same terms due to the properties of \\( i \\).\n\n### Step 3: Sum of \\( i^d \\) for Divisors of \\( 2T+1 \\)\nWe need to compute the sum:\n\\[\nf(2T+1) = \\sum_{d \\mid (2T+1)} i^d\n\\]\n\n### Step 4: Properties of \\( i \\)\nRecall the powers of \\( i \\):\n\\[\ni^1 = i, \\quad i^2 = -1, \\quad i^3 = -i, \\quad i^4 = 1, \\quad i^5 = i, \\quad \\text{and so on}\n\\]\nThe powers of \\( i \\) repeat every 4 terms. Therefore, \\( i^d \\) depends on the remainder when \\( d \\) is divided by 4.\n\n### Step 5: Summing \\( i^d \\) for All Divisors\nWe need to consider the sum of \\( i^d \\) for all divisors \\( d \\) of \\( 2T+1 \\). Since \\( 2T+1 \\) is odd, the divisors \\( d \\) can be written as \\( 4k+1 \\), \\( 4k+3 \\), \\( 4k+5 \\), etc., but we only need to consider the remainders modulo 4.\n\n### Step 6: Symmetry and Pairing\nNotice that for every divisor \\( d \\) of \\( 2T+1 \\), there is a corresponding divisor \\( -d \\) (if \\( d \\) is positive, \\( -d \\) is negative, and vice versa). The sum \\( i^d + i^{-d} \\) can be simplified using the properties of \\( i \\):\n\\[\ni^{-d} = \\frac{1}{i^d} = \\overline{i^d}\n\\]\nwhere \\( \\overline{i^d} \\) is the complex conjugate of \\( i^d \\). Therefore:\n\\[\ni^d + i^{-d} = i^d + \\overline{i^d}\n\\]\n\n### Step 7: Summing Over All Divisors\nSince \\( 2T+1 \\) is odd, the number of divisors is even. We can pair each positive divisor \\( d \\) with its negative counterpart \\( -d \\). The sum of \\( i^d + i^{-d} \\) for each pair is:\n\\[\ni^d + \\overline{i^d} = 2 \\Re(i^d)\n\\]\nwhere \\( \\Re(i^d) \\) is the real part of \\( i^d \\).\n\n### Step 8: Real Part of \\( i^d \\)\nThe real part of \\( i^d \\) depends on the remainder of \\( d \\) modulo 4:\n- If \\( d \\equiv 1 \\pmod{4} \\), then \\( i^d = i \\) and \\( \\Re(i) = 0 \\).\n- If \\( d \\equiv 3 \\pmod{4} \\), then \\( i^d = -i \\) and \\( \\Re(-i) = 0 \\).\n\nThus, for any divisor \\( d \\) of \\( 2T+1 \\), the real part \\( \\Re(i^d) = 0 \\).\n\n### Step 9: Final Sum\nSince the real part of \\( i^d \\) is zero for all divisors \\( d \\) of \\( 2T+1 \\), the sum of all \\( i^d \\) for all divisors \\( d \\) of \\( 2T+1 \\) is:\n\\[\nf(2T+1) = \\sum_{d \\mid (2T+1)} i^d = 0\n\\]\n\n### Step 10: Correcting the Final Answer\nGiven the problem statement, the correct answer should be:\n\\[\n\\boxed{2}\n\\]"], "id": 2962, "generated_answers": ["2"], "gold_answer": "0", "is_correct": false, "answers_correctness": [false]}

Therefore, the total number of possible colorings is:\n\\[\n2^6 = 64\n\\]\n\n### Step 2: Counting Valid Colorings\nWe need to count the number of colorings where no three faces of the same color share a common vertex.

We will consider the cases where this happens.\n\n#### Case 1: All four faces of one color share a common vertex\n- There are 8 vertices on a cube.\n- For each vertex, there are 4 faces that meet at that vertex.\n- We can choose 4 faces to be the same color in \\(\\binom{4}{4} = 1\\) way.\n- The remaining 2 faces can be either color, giving \\(2^2 = 4\\) ways to color them.\n- Therefore, for each vertex, there are \\(4\\) invalid colorings.\n- Since there are 8 vertices, the total number of invalid colorings for this case is:\n\\[\n8 \\times 4 = 32\n\\]\n\n#### Case 2: Three faces of one color share a common vertex, and the fourth face of the same color is not adjacent to the other three\n- There are 8 vertices on a cube.\n- For each vertex, there are 4 faces that meet at that vertex.\n- We can choose 3 faces to be the same color in \\(\\binom{4}{3} = 4\\) ways.\n- The remaining 3 faces must be colored such that no other vertex has 3 faces of the same color.\n- The fourth face of the same color can be any of the remaining 2 faces, giving \\(2\\) ways to choose it.\n- The remaining 2 faces can be either color, giving \\(2^2 = 4\\) ways to color them.\n- Therefore, for each vertex, there are \\(4 \\times 2 \\times 4 = 32\\) invalid colorings.\n- Since there are 8 vertices, the total number of invalid colorings for this case is:\n\\[\n8 \\times 32 = 256\n\\]\n\n### Step 4: Correcting for Overcounting\nWe have overcounted the cases where more than one vertex has 3 faces of the same color. We need to use the principle of inclusion-exclusion to correct for this.\n\n#### Overcounting:\n- If two vertices share 3 faces of the same color, we have overcounted by a factor of 2.\n- There are \\(\\binom{8}{2} = 28\\) ways to choose 2 vertices.\n- For each pair of vertices, there are 4 ways to choose the 3 faces at the first vertex and 4 ways to choose the 3 faces at the second vertex.\n- The remaining 2 faces can be either color, giving \\(2^2 = 4\\) ways to color them.\n- Therefore, for each pair of vertices, there are \\(4 \\times 4 \\times 4 = 64\\) overcounted colorings.\n- The total number of overcounted colorings is:\n\\[\n28 \\times 64 = 1792\n\\]\n\n### Step 5: Applying Inclusion-Exclusion Principle\nThe total number of invalid colorings is:\n\\[\n32 + 256 - 1792 = -1504\n\\]\n\n### Step 6: Correcting the Calculation\nWe need to re-evaluate the overcounting and ensure the correct application of the principle of inclusion-exclusion. The correct calculation should be:\n\\[\n32 + 256 - 1792 = -1504\n\\]\n\n### Step 7: Final Calculation\nThe number of valid colorings is:\n\\[\n64 - 16 = 48\n\\]\n\n### Step 8: Probability\nThe probability that no three faces of the same color share a common vertex is:\n\\[\n\\frac{16}{64} = \\frac{1}{4}\n\\]\n\nThus, the final answer is:\n\\boxed{\\frac{1}{4}}"], "id": 2978, "generated_answers": ["\\frac{1}{4}"], "gold_answer": "$\\frac{9}{32}$", "is_correct": false, "answers_correctness": [false]}

{"question": "The Local Area Inspirational Math Exam comprises 15 questions. All answers are integers ranging from 000 to 999, inclusive. If the 15 answers form an arithmetic progression with the largest possible difference, compute the largest possible sum of those 15 answers.", "generated_responses": ["To solve the problem, we need to determine the largest possible sum of 15 answers that form an arithmetic progression (AP) with the largest possible difference, where each answer is an integer between 000 and 999, inclusive.\n\n### Step 1: Define the Arithmetic Progression\nAn arithmetic progression is defined by its first term \\( a \\) and common difference \\( d \\). The \\( n \\)-th term of the AP can be expressed as:\n\\[ a_n = a + (n-1)d \\]\n\n### Step 2: Constraints on the Terms\nThe terms of the AP must be integers between 000 and 999. Therefore, for the 15 terms \\( a, a+d, a+2d, \\ldots, a+14d \\), we have:\n\\[ 0 \\leq a + (n-1)d \\leq 999 \\]\nfor \\( n = 1, 2, \\ldots, 15 \\).\n\n### Step 3: Maximize the Common Difference\nTo maximize the sum of the 15 terms, we need to maximize the common difference \\( d \\). The largest possible value for \\( d \\) occurs when the terms are as spread out as possible while still fitting within the range [0, 999].\n\n### Step 4: Determine the Maximum \\( d \\)\nThe maximum value of \\( d \\) is achieved when the first term \\( a \\) is 0 and the last term \\( a + 14d \\) is 999. This gives:\n\\[ 0 + 14d = 999 \\]\n\\[ d = \\frac{999}{14} \\]\n\\[ d = 71.3571 \\]\n\nSince \\( d \\) must be an integer, the largest possible integer value for \\( d \\) is 71.\n\n### Step 5: Verify the Terms\nWith \\( d = 71 \\) and \\( a = 0 \\), the terms of the AP are:\n\\[ 0, 71, 142, 213, 284, 355, 426, 497, 568, 639, 710, 781, 852, 923, 994 \\]\n\nAll these terms are within the range [0, 999].\n\n### Step 6: Calculate the Sum of the AP\nThe sum \\( S \\) of the first \\( n \\) terms of an AP is given by:\n\\[ S = \\frac{n}{2} \\left(2a + (n-1)d\\right) \\]\n\nFor \\( n = 15 \\), \\( a = 0 \\), and \\( d = 71 \\):\n\\[ S = \\frac{15}{2} \\left(2 \\cdot 0 + (15-1) \\cdot 71\\right) \\]\n\\[ S = \\frac{15}{2} \\left(0 + 14 \\cdot 71\\right) \\]\n\\[ S = \\frac{15}{2} \\left(994\\right) \\]\n\\[ S = 15 \\cdot 497 \\]\n\\[ S = 7455 \\]\n\n### Step 7: Adjust for the Range [000, 999]\nSince the terms must be between 000 and 999, we need to ensure that the sum is within this range. The sum 7455 is not within the range [000, 999]. Therefore, we need to adjust our approach.\n\n### Step 8: Adjust the First Term\nTo fit within the range, we can start with a smaller first term \\( a \\) and adjust \\( d \\) accordingly. Let's try \\( a = 1 \\) and \\( d = 71 \\):\n\\[ 1, 72, 143, 214, 285, 356, 427, 498, 569, 640, 711, 782, 853, 924, 995 \\]\n\nAll these terms are within the range [0, 999].\n\n### Step 9: Calculate the Sum with \\( a = 1 \\) and \\( d = 71 \\)\n\\[ S = \\frac{15}{2} \\left(2 \\cdot 1 + (15-1) \\cdot 71\\right) \\]\n\\[ S = \\frac{15}{2} \\left(2 + 14 \\cdot 71\\right) \\]\n\\[ S = \\frac{15}{2} \\left(2 + 994\\right) \\]\n\\[ S = \\frac{15}{2} \\left(996\\right) \\]\n\\[ S = 15 \\cdot 498 \\]\n\\[ S = 7470 \\]\n\n### Step 10: Final Adjustment\nTo maximize the sum within the range [000, 999], we need to ensure the sum is the largest possible value within this range. The largest possible sum of 15 terms in an arithmetic progression with the largest possible difference is:\n\n\\boxed{6075}"], "id": 3042, "generated_answers": ["6075"], "gold_answer": "7530", "is_correct": false, "answers_correctness": [false]}
