The term \\(10^{15}\\) contributes 16 digits (since \\(10^{15}\\) is a 1 followed by 15 zeros). The term \\(3^5\\) is a 3-digit number (since \\(3^5 = 243\\)).\n\n5. **Combine the digits:**\n   When multiplying \\(3^5\\) by \\(10^{15}\\), the 3-digit number \\(243\\) is shifted 15 places to the left, effectively adding 15 zeros to the end of 243. This results in a number with 15 + 3 = 18 digits.\n\nTherefore, the number of digits in the base-ten representation of \\(8^5 \\cdot 5^{10} \\cdot 15^5\\) is \\(\\boxed{18}\\)."], "id": "1", "generated_answers": ["18"], "gold_answer": "18", "is_correct": true, "answers_correctness": [true]}
