Let's break down the problem step by step.\n\n1. **Identify the structure of the date display:**\n   - The date is represented as an 8-digit integer: \\( \\text{YYYYMMDD} \\).\n   - For the year 2023, the first four digits are fixed as 2023.\n   - The next two digits represent the month (01 to 12).\n   - The last two digits represent the day of the month (01 to 31).\n\n2. **Determine the conditions for each digit to appear an even number of times:**\n   - The digits 2 and 3 must appear an even number of times.\n   - The digits 0 and 1 must appear an even number of times.\n   - The digits 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9 must appear an even number of times.\n\n3. **Analyze the fixed part of the date:**\n   - The fixed part is 2023.\n   - The digits 2 and 3 appear twice each, which is even.\n   - The digits 0 and 1 appear once each, which is odd.\n\n4. **Determine the conditions for the month and day:**\n   - The month (MM) must be such that the digits in MM appear an even number of times.\n   - The day (DD) must be such that the digits in DD appear an even number of times.\n\n5. **List the valid months and days:**\n   - For the month, the valid months are those where the digits appear an even number of times. The valid months are 01, 02, 03, 04, 05, 06, 07, 08, 09, 10, 11, and 12.\n   - For the day, the valid days are those where the digits appear an even number of times. The valid days are 01, 02, 03, 04, 05, 06, 07, 08, 09, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, and 31.\n\n6. **Count the valid combinations:**\n   - There are 12 valid months.\n   - There are 31 valid days.\n   - The total number of valid dates is the product of the number of valid months and the number of valid days.\n\n\\[\n12 \\times 31 = 372\n\\]\n\nHowever, we need to ensure that the digits in the month and day appear an even number of times. We need to re-evaluate the valid days to ensure they meet the criteria.\n\n7. **Re-evaluate the valid days:**\n   - The valid days are those where the digits appear an even number of times. The valid days are 01, 02, 03, 04, 05, 06, 07, 08, 09, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, and 31.\n   - The valid days are 01, 02, 03, 04, 05, 06, 07, 08, 09, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, and 31.\n\n8. **Count the valid combinations again:**\n   - There are 12 valid months.\n   - There are 16 valid days.\n   - The total number of valid dates is the product of the number of valid months and the number of valid days.\n\n\\[\n12 \\times 16 = 192\n\\]\n\nThus, the number of dates in 2023 where each digit appears an even number of times in the 8-digit display is \\(\\boxed{192}\\)."], "id": 21, "generated_answers": ["192"], "gold_answer": "9.0", "is_correct": false, "answers_correctness": [false]}
