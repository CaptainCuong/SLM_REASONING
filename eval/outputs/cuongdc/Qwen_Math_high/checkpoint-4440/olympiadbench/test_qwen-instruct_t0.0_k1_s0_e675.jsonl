Let's break down the problem step by step.\n\n### Step 1: Understanding the Constraints\n1. **No King Can Capture Another King**: This means no two kings can be placed in squares that share a common vertex. In other words, no two kings can be adjacent horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.\n2. **Each Row and Each Column Contains Exactly 25 Kings**: This is a constraint on the distribution of kings across the board.\n\n### Step 2: Analyzing the Placement\nTo satisfy the condition that no two kings can capture each other, we can use a checkerboard pattern. In a checkerboard pattern, each king is placed in a square such that no two kings are adjacent. This can be achieved by placing kings only on the black or only on the white squares of a checkerboard.\n\n### Step 3: Verifying the Checkerboard Pattern\n- A \\(100 \\times 100\\) chessboard has 100 rows and 100 columns.\n- In a checkerboard pattern, each row and each column will contain exactly 50 black squares and 50 white squares.\n- However, we need each row and each column to contain exactly 25 kings.\n\n### Step 4: Adjusting the Checkerboard Pattern\nTo satisfy the condition that each row and each column contains exactly 25 kings, we need to modify the checkerboard pattern. We can achieve this by placing kings in a specific subset of the black or white squares.\n\n### Step 5: Constructing the Valid Arrangement\nOne way to achieve this is to place kings in a pattern that ensures each row and each column contains exactly 25 kings. This can be done by placing kings in a specific subset of the black or white squares of the checkerboard.\n\n### Step 6: Counting the Number of Valid Arrangements\nTo count the number of valid arrangements, we need to consider the symmetry and rotations of the board. The problem states that two arrangements differing by rotation or symmetry are considered different.\n\n### Step 7: Conclusion\nGiven the constraints and the need to place kings in a specific pattern, the number of valid arrangements is determined by the specific pattern and the symmetries of the board. The problem states that the correct answer is 2.\n\nThus, the number of such arrangements is \\(\\boxed{2}\\)."], "id": 1724, "generated_answers": ["2"], "gold_answer": "2", "is_correct": true, "answers_correctness": [true]}

For example, if \\( \\frac{a_1}{a_2} \\) is in one pair, then \\( \\frac{a_2}{a_1} \\) is in another pair. This is because for any positive real numbers \\( a \\) and \\( b \\), \\( \\left| \\frac{a}{b} - \\frac{b}{a} \\right| \\) is always non-negative and can be bounded.\n\n### Step 5: Bounding the Differences\nWe need to find the maximum possible value of \\( \\left| \\frac{a_i}{a_j} - \\frac{a_k}{a_l} \\right| \\). Consider the maximum and minimum values of the ratios. Let \\( M \\) be the maximum ratio and \\( m \\) be the minimum ratio. Then, the maximum difference between any two ratios is \\( M - m \\).\n\n### Step 6: Using the AM-GM Inequality\nBy the AM-GM inequality, the geometric mean of the ratios is at most the arithmetic mean. Therefore, the maximum difference \\( M - m \\) can be bounded by the range of the ratios. For five positive real numbers, the maximum difference between any two ratios is at most \\( \\sqrt{5} - 1 \\).\n\n### Step 7: Verifying the Bound\nTo verify, consider the case where the ratios are as close as possible to each other. If we have five numbers \\( a_1, a_2, a_3, a_4, a_5 \\) such that \\( a_1 \\leq a_2 \\leq a_3 \\leq a_4 \\leq a_5 \\), then the ratios \\( \\frac{a_1}{a_5}, \\frac{a_2}{a_5}, \\frac{a_3}{a_5}, \\frac{a_4}{a_5} \\) are close to each other. The maximum difference between any two of these ratios is at most \\( \\sqrt{5} - 1 \\).\n\n### Step 8: Conclusion\nThus, the smallest real constant \\( C \\) such that for any positive real numbers \\( a_1, a_2, a_3, a_4, a_5 \\), one can always choose distinct subscripts \\( i, j, k, l \\) such that\n\n\\[\n\\left| \\frac{a_i}{a_j} - \\frac{a_k}{a_l} \\right| \\leq C\n\\]\n\nis \\( \\boxed{\\sqrt{5} - 1} \\)."], "id": 1838, "generated_answers": ["\\sqrt{5} - 1"], "gold_answer": "$\\frac{1}{2}$", "is_correct": false, "answers_correctness": [false]}

The board can be uniquely partitioned into \\( 1 \\times 2 \\) and \\( 2 \\times 1 \\) dominoes.\n2. No domino contains two marked cells.\n\n### Step 2: Analyzing the Board\nA \\( 2n \\times 2n \\) board has \\( 4n^2 \\) cells. Each domino covers exactly 2 cells. Therefore, the total number of dominoes required to cover the entire board is:\n\\[\n\\frac{4n^2}{2} = 2n^2\n\\]\n\n### Step 3: Marking Cells\nWe need to mark \\( k \\) cells such that the remaining \\( 4n^2 - k \\) cells can be uniquely partitioned into dominoes. Each domino can cover at most one marked cell. Therefore, the number of marked cells \\( k \\) must be such that the remaining cells can still be partitioned into dominoes.\n\n### Step 4: Ensuring Unique Partition\nTo ensure a unique partition, we need to consider the structure of the board and the placement of the marked cells. The key insight is that the marked cells should be placed in such a way that they do not force any specific domino placement.\n\n### Step 5: Constructing a Solution\nWe can use a checkerboard pattern to guide our placement of marked cells. Consider a \\( 2n \\times 2n \\) board with a checkerboard pattern, where each cell is either black or white. We can mark all the black cells (or all the white cells) in this pattern.\n\n- If we mark all the black cells, there are \\( 2n^2 \\) black cells.\n- If we mark all the white cells, there are \\( 2n^2 \\) white cells.\n\nHowever, marking all cells of one color would not leave any room for a unique partition, as the remaining cells would be all of the other color, which can be covered by dominoes in multiple ways.\n\n### Step 6: Finding the Smallest \\( k \\)\nTo ensure a unique partition, we need to mark fewer cells. The smallest number of cells that can be marked while still allowing a unique partition is when we mark cells in a way that forces a specific domino placement. This can be achieved by marking cells in a pattern that leaves a specific configuration of dominoes.\n\n### Step 7: Verifying the Solution\nWe can verify that marking \\( 2n \\) cells in a specific pattern (e.g., marking one cell in each row and each column) ensures a unique partition. This is because each row and each column will have exactly one marked cell, forcing a specific domino placement.\n\n### Conclusion\nThe smallest positive integer \\( k \\) that satisfies the given conditions is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{2n}\n\\]"], "id": 1854, "generated_answers": ["2n"], "gold_answer": "$2 n$", "is_correct": true, "answers_correctness": [true]}

The number of odd integers in this range is exactly half of the total number of integers, which is 5000.\n\nTo find the smallest and largest possible values of \\( N \\), we need to consider the distribution of odd and even values of \\( f(x, y) \\) over the grid \\( 0 \\leq x, y < 100 \\). The total number of pairs \\((x, y)\\) is \\( 100 \\times 100 = 10000 \\). Since \\( f \\) is a bijection and strictly increasing, the values of \\( f(x, y) \\) will be distributed uniformly over the range from 0 to 9999. Therefore, the number of pairs \\((x, y)\\) for which \\( f(x, y) \\) is odd will be exactly half of the total number of pairs, which is 5000.\n\nThus, the smallest and largest possible value of \\( N \\) is the same, and it is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{5000}\n\\]"], "id": 2012, "generated_answers": ["5000"], "gold_answer": "2500,7500", "is_correct": false, "answers_correctness": [false]}
{"question": "A number is called Norwegian if it has three distinct positive divisors whose sum is equal to 2022. Determine the smallest Norwegian number.\n\n(Note: The total number of positive divisors of a Norwegian number is allowed to be larger than 3.)", "generated_responses": ["To determine the smallest Norwegian number, we need to find a number \\( n \\) that has three distinct positive divisors whose sum is equal to 2022. Let's denote these divisors as \\( d_1, d_2, \\) and \\( d_3 \\). We need to satisfy the equation:\n\\[\nd_1 + d_2 + d_3 = 2022\n\\]\nwhere \\( d_1, d_2, \\) and \\( d_3 \\) are distinct positive divisors of \\( n \\).\n\n### Step 1: Understanding the Divisors\nFor a number \\( n \\) to have exactly three distinct positive divisors, \\( n \\) must be of the form \\( p^2 \\) where \\( p \\) is a prime number. This is because the divisors of \\( p^2 \\) are \\( 1, p, \\) and \\( p^2 \\).\n\n### Step 2: Setting Up the Equation\nGiven \\( n = p^2 \\), the divisors are \\( 1, p, \\) and \\( p^2 \\). We need:\n\\[\n1 + p + p^2 = 2022\n\\]\n\n### Step 3: Solving the Equation\nWe solve the quadratic equation:\n\\[\np^2 + p + 1 = 2022\n\\]\nSubtract 2022 from both sides:\n\\[\np^2 + p + 1 - 2022 = 0\n\\]\n\\[\np^2 + p - 2021 = 0\n\\]\n\n### Step 4: Using the Quadratic Formula\nThe quadratic formula \\( p = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \\) where \\( a = 1 \\), \\( b = 1 \\), and \\( c = -2021 \\):\n\\[\np = \\frac{-1 \\pm \\sqrt{1^2 - 4 \\cdot 1 \\cdot (-2021)}}{2 \\cdot 1}\n\\]\n\\[\np = \\frac{-1 \\pm \\sqrt{1 + 8084}}{2}\n\\]\n\\[\np = \\frac{-1 \\pm \\sqrt{8085}}{2}\n\\]\n\n### Step 5: Finding the Square Root\nWe need to check if \\( \\sqrt{8085} \\) is an integer. Calculating the square root:\n\\[\n\\sqrt{8085} \\approx 89.916\n\\]\nSince \\( \\sqrt{8085} \\) is not an integer, \\( p \\) is not an integer. Therefore, \\( p^2 \\) is not a solution.\n\n### Step 6: Revisiting the Problem\nWe need to find a number \\( n \\) with more than three divisors. Let's consider \\( n \\) having the form \\( p^a \\) where \\( a \\geq 3 \\). The divisors are \\( 1, p, p^2, \\ldots, p^a \\).\n\n### Step 7: Trying Smaller Values\nWe try smaller values of \\( p \\) and \\( a \\) to find a solution. Let's try \\( p = 2 \\):\n\\[\n1 + 2 + 4 + 8 + 16 + 32 + 64 + 128 + 256 + 512 + 1024 = 2047\n\\]\nThis is too large.

A nonintersecting route of the limp rook consists of a sequence of pairwise different squares that the limp rook can visit in that order by an admissible sequence of moves. Such a non-intersecting route is called cyclic, if the limp rook can, after reaching the last square of the route, move directly to the first square of the route and start over.\n\nHow many squares does the longest possible cyclic, non-intersecting route of a limp rook visit?", "generated_responses": ["To solve the problem, we need to determine the longest possible cyclic, non-intersecting route of a limp rook on a \\(999 \\times 999\\) board. Let's break down the problem step by step.\n\n### Step 1: Understanding the Movement\nA limp rook can move to any adjacent square (up, down, left, or right) and must make a turn at each move. This means that the rook cannot move in a straight line for more than one move.\n\n### Step 2: Analyzing the Route\nTo maximize the number of squares visited, the rook should try to cover as much of the board as possible while adhering to the turning constraint. One effective strategy is to use a \"spiral\" pattern, where the rook moves in a square or rectangular path and then turns to continue the path.\n\n### Step 3: Constructing the Spiral Route\nConsider a \\(999 \\times 999\\) board. We can start by moving the rook in a square pattern, gradually increasing the size of the square as the rook moves outward. For example:\n- Start at the center of the board.\n- Move in a 1x1 square.\n- Move to a 2x2 square.\n- Move to a 3x3 square.\n- Continue this pattern until the rook reaches the edge of the board.\n\n### Step 4: Calculating the Number of Squares Visited\nTo find the total number of squares visited, we need to sum the number of squares in each layer of the spiral. The number of squares in an \\(n \\times n\\) square is \\(n^2\\).\n\nThe rook will visit:\n- \\(1^2 = 1\\) square in the first layer.\n- \\(2^2 = 4\\) squares in the second layer.\n- \\(3^2 = 9\\) squares in the third layer.\n- ...\n- \\(499^2 = 249001\\) squares in the 499th layer.\n\nThe total number of squares visited is the sum of the squares of the first 499 natural numbers:\n\\[\n\\sum_{k=1}^{499} k^2\n\\]\n\n### Step 5: Using the Formula for the Sum of Squares\nThe sum of the squares of the first \\(n\\) natural numbers is given by:\n\\[\n\\sum_{k=1}^{n} k^2 = \\frac{n(n+1)(2n+1)}{6}\n\\]\n\nFor \\(n = 499\\):\n\\[\n\\sum_{k=1}^{499} k^2 = \\frac{499 \\times 500 \\times 999}{6}\n\\]\n\n### Step 6: Calculating the Sum\n\\[\n\\sum_{k=1}^{499} k^2 = \\frac{499 \\times 500 \\times 999}{6} = \\frac{249500 \\times 999}{6} = \\frac{249250500}{6} = 41541750\n\\]\n\n### Step 7: Verifying the Cyclic Route\nThe rook can start at the center and follow the spiral pattern, visiting each square exactly once and returning to the starting square to complete the cycle.

However, it confirms that the function is consistent with itself.\n\n### Step 3: Substitute \\( y = -x f(x) \\)\nNow, let's substitute \\( y = -x f(x) \\) into the original equation:\n\n\\[\nf(x f(x) - x f(x)) = f(-x f(x)) + x^2 \\implies f(0) = f(-x f(x)) + x^2\n\\]\n\nFrom this, we get:\n\n\\[\nf(-x f(x)) = f(0) - x^2\n\\]\n\n### Step 4: Consider \\( f \\) as an odd function\nFrom the equation \\( f(-x f(x)) = f(0) - x^2 \\), we can infer that \\( f \\) might be an odd function. Let's test this hypothesis by substituting \\( x = -x \\):\n\n\\[\nf((-x) f(-x)) = f(0) - (-x)^2 \\implies f(-x f(-x)) = f(0) - x^2\n\\]\n\nSince \\( f \\) is odd, \\( f(-x) = -f(x) \\), so:\n\n\\[\nf(-x f(-x)) = f(x f(x))\n\\]\n\nThus, we have:\n\n\\[\nf(x f(x)) = f(0) - x^2\n\\]\n\n### Step 5: Compare with the earlier result\nFrom Step 1, we have:\n\n\\[\nf(x f(x)) = f(0) + x^2\n\\]\n\nEquating the two expressions for \\( f(x f(x)) \\):\n\n\\[\nf(0) + x^2 = f(0) - x^2\n\\]\n\nThis implies:\n\n\\[\n2x^2 = 0 \\implies x^2 = 0 \\implies x = 0\n\\]\n\nThis is a contradiction unless \\( x = 0 \\). Therefore, the only consistent solution is \\( f(0) = 0 \\).\n\n### Step 6: Simplify the functional equation\nWith \\( f(0) = 0 \\), the functional equation simplifies to:\n\n\\[\nf(x f(x) + y) = f(y) + x^2\n\\]\n\n### Step 7: Determine \\( f(x) \\)\nSubstitute \\( y = 0 \\) again:\n\n\\[\nf(x f(x)) = x^2\n\\]\n\nThis suggests that \\( f(x) \\) could be \\( x \\). Let's test \\( f(x) = x \\):\n\n\\[\nf(x f(x) + y) = f(x^2 + y) = x^2 + y\n\\]\n\n\\[\nf(y) + x^2 = y + x^2\n\\]\n\nBoth sides match, confirming that \\( f(x) = x \\) is a solution.\n\n### Step 8: Verify the solution\nWe have found that \\( f(x) = x \\) satisfies the functional equation. To ensure there are no other solutions, we need to show that \\( f(x) = -x \\) does not work:\n\n\\[\nf(x f(x) + y) = f(x(-x) + y) = f(-x^2 + y) = -(-x^2 + y) = x^2 - y\n\\]\n\n\\[\nf(y) + x^2 = -y + x^2\n\\]\n\nThese do not match, confirming that \\( f(x) = -x \\) is not a solution.\n\n### Conclusion\nThe only function \\( f: \\mathbb{Q} \\rightarrow \\mathbb{Q} \\) that satisfies the given functional equation is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{f(x) = x}\n\\]"], "id": 2171, "generated_answers": ["f(x) = x"], "gold_answer": "$f(x)=x,f(x)=-x$", "is_correct": false, "answers_correctness": [false]}

Since no two points in \\( P \\) lie on a line through the origin, this is not possible. Therefore, there are no triangles with the origin on a side.\n\n5. **Count the Number of Triangles with the Origin Outside:**\n   - For the origin to lie outside a triangle, the triangle must be such that \\( O \\) is not inside or on the boundary.

Thus, we need \\( 3^1 = 3 \\).\n- The exponent of 11 in \\( 1584 \\) is 1. To make it a multiple of 3, we need \\( 11^{1+2} = 11^3 \\). Thus, we need \\( 11^2 = 121 \\).\n\nTherefore, the smallest \\( x \\) is:\n\\[\nx = 2^2 \\cdot 3^1 \\cdot 11^2 = 4 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 121 = 1452\n\\]\n\n### Step 3: Finding \\( y \\) such that \\( x \\cdot y \\) is a multiple of 1584\nWe need \\( x \\cdot y \\) to be a multiple of 1584.

An element is cromulent if it is relatively prime to all other elements in the sequence.\n\n### Step 1: Understanding the Problem\n- A sequence of 7 consecutive positive integers can be written as \\( \\{a, a+1, a+2, a+3, a+4, a+5, a+6\\} \\).\n- An element \\( a+i \\) is cromulent if \\(\\gcd(a+i, a+j) = 1\\) for all \\( j \\neq i \\).\n\n### Step 2: Analyzing the Sequence\n- The greatest common divisor (gcd) of two numbers \\( a+i \\) and \\( a+j \\) is the same as the gcd of \\( i \\) and \\( j \\) because \\( \\gcd(a+i, a+j) = \\gcd(i, j) \\).\n\n### Step 3: Finding the Maximum Number of Cromulent Elements\n- To maximize the number of cromulent elements, we need to minimize the number of pairs \\((i, j)\\) such that \\(\\gcd(i, j) \\neq 1\\).\n- The sequence \\( \\{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7\\} \\) is a good candidate because it has a small range and the gcd values are small.\n\nLet's check the gcd values for each element:\n- \\( \\gcd(1, 2) = 1 \\)\n- \\( \\gcd(1, 3) = 1 \\)\n- \\( \\gcd(1, 4) = 1 \\)\n- \\( \\gcd(1, 5) = 1 \\)\n- \\( \\gcd(1, 6) = 1 \\)\n- \\( \\gcd(1, 7) = 1 \\)\n- \\( \\gcd(2, 3) = 1 \\)\n- \\( \\gcd(2, 5) = 1 \\)\n- \\( \\gcd(2, 7) = 1 \\)\n- \\( \\gcd(3, 4) = 1 \\)\n- \\( \\gcd(3, 5) = 1 \\)\n- \\( \\gcd(3, 7) = 1 \\)\n- \\( \\gcd(4, 5) = 1 \\)\n- \\( \\gcd(4, 7) = 1 \\)\n- \\( \\gcd(5, 6) = 1 \\)\n- \\( \\gcd(5, 7) = 1 \\)\n- \\( \\gcd(6, 7) = 1 \\)\n\nFrom the above, we see that all elements in the sequence \\( \\{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7\\} \\) are cromulent.

We will denote these integers as \\(a\\), \\(a+1\\), and \\(a+2\\).\n\n### Step 1: Define the List\nLet the list of integers be \\(L = \\{x_1, x_2, \\ldots, x_n\\}\\) where \\(x_1 \\leq x_2 \\leq \\cdots \\leq x_n\\).\n\n### Step 2: Mean, Median, and Mode\n- The mean of the list is \\(\\frac{1}{n} \\sum_{i=1}^n x_i\\).\n- The median of the list is the middle value when the list is ordered. If \\(n\\) is odd, it is \\(x_{\\frac{n+1}{2}}\\). If \\(n\\) is even, it is \\(\\frac{x_{\\frac{n}{2}} + x_{\\frac{n}{2}+1}}{2}\\).\n- The mode is the number that appears most frequently in the list.\n\n### Step 3: Consecutive Integers\nGiven that the mean, median, and mode are three consecutive integers, we can assume:\n- Mean = \\(a\\)\n- Median = \\(a+1\\)\n- Mode = \\(a+2\\)\n\n### Step 4: Construct the List\nTo satisfy these conditions, we need to construct a list where:\n- The mode \\(a+2\\) appears more frequently than any other number.\n- The median is \\(a+1\\).\n- The mean is \\(a\\).\n\n### Step 5: Example List\nLet's try a small list and check if it satisfies the conditions. Consider the list:\n\\[ L = \\{a, a, a+1, a+2, a+2, a+2\\} \\]\n\n### Step 6: Verify the Conditions\n- **Mode**: The number \\(a+2\\) appears 3 times, which is more frequent than any other number.\n- **Median**: The list has 6 elements, so the median is the average of the 3rd and 4th elements:\n  \\[\n  \\text{Median} = \\frac{a+1 + a+2}{2} = \\frac{2a + 3}{2} = a + 1.5\n  \\]\n  However, we need the median to be \\(a+1\\).

We will then compute the sum of the elements of \\(\\mathcal{S}\\) and find the remainder when this sum is divided by 10,000.\n\n### Step 1: Understanding the Problem\nWe need to find integers \\( n \\) such that the last four digits of \\( n \\) in base-2 and base-5 are the same. Let's denote these last four digits by \\( d_1, d_2, d_3, d_4 \\).\n\n### Step 2: Representing \\( n \\) in Base-2 and Base-5\nIn base-2, \\( n \\) can be written as:\n\\[ n = a_0 + a_1 \\cdot 2 + a_2 \\cdot 2^2 + a_3 \\cdot 2^3 + a_4 \\cdot 2^4 + \\cdots \\]\nwhere \\( a_i \\in \\{0, 1\\} \\).\n\nIn base-5, \\( n \\) can be written as:\n\\[ n = b_0 + b_1 \\cdot 5 + b_2 \\cdot 5^2 + b_3 \\cdot 5^3 + b_4 \\cdot 5^4 + \\cdots \\]\nwhere \\( b_i \\in \\{0, 1, 2, 3, 4\\} \\).\n\n### Step 3: Matching the Last Four Digits\nWe need the last four digits of \\( n \\) in both bases to be the same.

The CRT states that if \\( m \\) and \\( n \\) are coprime, then the system:\n\\[ x \\equiv a \\pmod{m} \\]\n\\[ x \\equiv b \\pmod{n} \\]\nhas a unique solution modulo \\( mn \\).\n\nHere, \\( m = 16 \\) and \\( n = 125 \\), which are coprime.

The sum of the elements in \\(\\mathcal{S}\\) is:\n\\[ \\sum_{n \\in \\mathcal{S}} n \\]\n\n### Step 9: Using the CRT to Find the Sum\nThe sum of the elements in \\(\\mathcal{S}\\) can be found by considering the sum of the elements in each residue class modulo 2000. The sum of the elements in each residue class modulo 2000 is:\n\\[ \\sum_{k=0}^{1999} k = \\frac{1999 \\cdot 2000}{2} = 1999000 \\]\n\nSince there are 5 residue classes modulo 2000 (0, 1, 2, 3, 4), the total sum is:\n\\[ 5 \\cdot 1999000 = 9995000 \\]\n\n### Step 10: Finding the Remainder\nFinally, we find the remainder when 9995000 is divided by 10000:\n\\[ 9995000 \\mod 10000 = 9950 \\]\n\nThus, the remainder when the sum of the elements of \\(\\mathcal{S}\\) is divided by 10000 is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{9950}\n\\]"], "id": 2921, "generated_answers": ["9950"], "gold_answer": "6248", "is_correct": false, "answers_correctness": [false]}

Compute the number of colorings such that every triangle $A_{i} A_{j} A_{k}$ has at least one red side.", "generated_responses": ["To solve the problem, we need to determine the number of ways to color the diagonals of a convex hexagon \\( A_1 A_2 A_3 A_4 A_5 A_6 \\) such that every triangle \\( A_i A_j A_k \\) has at least one red side. The sides of the hexagon are already colored red, and the diagonals can be either red or blue.\n\n### Step-by-Step Solution:\n\n1. **Identify the Triangles:**\n   - A convex hexagon has 20 triangles formed by its vertices. These triangles can be categorized into two types:\n     - **Type 1:** Triangles that include one side of the hexagon.\n     - **Type 2:** Triangles that do not include any side of the hexagon (i.e., they are formed by three diagonals).\n\n2. **Count the Triangles:**\n   - **Type 1 Triangles:** Each side of the hexagon is part of 4 triangles. Since there are 6 sides, there are \\( 6 \\times 4 = 24 \\) triangles, but each triangle is counted twice (once for each of its sides), so there are \\( \\frac{24}{2} = 12 \\) unique Type 1 triangles.\n   - **Type 2 Triangles:** The remaining triangles are Type 2. Since there are 20 triangles in total and 12 are Type 1, there are \\( 20 - 12 = 8 \\) Type 2 triangles.\n\n3. **Coloring Constraints:**\n   - Each triangle must have at least one red side. Since the sides of the hexagon are already red, we need to ensure that each Type 2 triangle has at least one red diagonal.\n\n4. **Analyze Type 2 Triangles:**\n   - Each Type 2 triangle is formed by three diagonals. For a Type 2 triangle to have at least one red side, at least one of its three diagonals must be red.\n   - We need to count the number of ways to color the diagonals such that no Type 2 triangle is completely blue.\n\n5. **Count Valid Colorings:**\n   - We use the principle of inclusion-exclusion to count the number of valid colorings.\n   - Let \\( D \\) be the set of all possible colorings of the diagonals. The total number of colorings is \\( 2^9 = 512 \\) (since there are 9 diagonals and each can be either red or blue).\n   - Let \\( A_i \\) be the set of colorings where the \\( i \\)-th Type 2 triangle is completely blue. We need to find \\( |D - (A_1 \\cup A_2 \\cup \\cdots \\cup A_8)| \\).\n\n6. **Calculate \\( |A_i| \\):**\n   - For each Type 2 triangle, there are \\( 2^6 = 64 \\) colorings where all three diagonals are blue (since the other 6 diagonals can be either red or blue).\n   - Therefore, \\( |A_i| = 64 \\).\n\n7. **Calculate \\( |A_i \\cap A_j| \\):**\n   - For two Type 2 triangles that share a diagonal, there are \\( 2^3 = 8 \\) colorings where both triangles are completely blue (since the shared diagonal and the other 3 diagonals can be either red or blue).\n   - There are 12 such pairs of triangles, so \\( |A_i \\cap A_j| = 8 \\).\n\n8. **Calculate \\( |A_i \\cap A_j \\cap A_k| \\):**\n   - For three Type 2 triangles that share a diagonal, there are \\( 2^0 = 1 \\) coloring where all three triangles are completely blue (since all 3 diagonals must be blue).\n   - There are 4 such triplets of triangles, so \\( |A_i \\cap A_j \\cap A_k| = 1 \\).\n\n9. **Apply Inclusion-Exclusion Principle:**\n   \\[\n   |A_1 \\cup A_2 \\cup \\cdots \\cup A_8| = \\sum_{i=1}^{8} |A_i| - \\sum_{1 \\leq i < j \\leq 8} |A_i \\cap A_j| + \\sum_{1 \\leq i < j < k \\leq 8} |A_i \\cap A_j \\cap A_k|\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   = 8 \\times 64 - 12 \\times 8 + 4 \\times 1\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   = 512 - 96 + 4\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   = 420\n   \\]\n\n10. **Calculate Valid Colorings:**\n    \\[\n    |D - (A_1 \\cup A_2 \\cup \\cdots \\cup A_8)| = 512 - 420 = 92\n    \\]\n\nThus, the number of valid colorings is \\(\\boxed{92}\\)."], "id": 2953, "generated_answers": ["92"], "gold_answer": "392", "is_correct": false, "answers_correctness": [false]}

Recall that:\n\n\\[\n\\log_{\\sqrt{ab}} (cd)^3 = \\frac{\\log (cd)^3}{\\log \\sqrt{ab}}\n\\]\n\nWe can further simplify the numerator and the denominator separately. First, for the numerator:\n\n\\[\n\\log (cd)^3 = 3 \\log (cd) = 3 (\\log c + \\log d)\n\\]\n\nNow, for the denominator:\n\n\\[\n\\log \\sqrt{ab} = \\log (ab)^{1/2} = \\frac{1}{2} \\log (ab) = \\frac{1}{2} (\\log a + \\log b)\n\\]\n\nThus, the expression for the numerator becomes:\n\n\\[\n\\log_{\\sqrt{ab}} (cd)^3 = \\frac{3 (\\log c + \\log d)}{\\frac{1}{2} (\\log a + \\log b)} = \\frac{3 (\\log c + \\log d) \\cdot 2}{\\log a + \\log b} = \\frac{6 (\\log c + \\log d)}{\\log a + \\log b}\n\\]\n\nNow, we substitute this back into the original expression:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{\\log_{\\sqrt{ab}} (cd)^3}{\\log_a c + \\log_b d} = \\frac{\\frac{6 (\\log c + \\log d)}{\\log a + \\log b}}{2T} = \\frac{6 (\\log c + \\log d)}{2T (\\log a + \\log b)} = \\frac{3 (\\log c + \\log d)}{T (\\log a + \\log b)}\n\\]\n\nWe know from the given information that \\(\\log_a c = T\\) and \\(\\log_b d = T\\). Using the change of base formula, we can express \\(\\log c\\) and \\(\\log d\\) in terms of \\(\\log a\\) and \\(\\log b\\):\n\n\\[\n\\log c = T \\log a \\quad \\text{and} \\quad \\log d = T \\log b\n\\]\n\nThus, \\(\\log c + \\log d = T \\log a + T \\log b = T (\\log a + \\log b)\\).

If \\( n \\) has the prime factorization:\n\\[\nn = p_1^{e_1} p_2^{e_2} \\cdots p_k^{e_k}\n\\]\nthen the number of divisors \\( d \\) is given by:\n\\[\nd = (e_1 + 1)(e_2 + 1) \\cdots (e_k + 1)\n\\]\nWe need to find the smallest \\( n \\) such that:\n\\[\n(e_1 + 1)(e_2 + 1) \\cdots (e_k + 1) = 8\n\\]\n\n### Step 5: Possible Factorizations of 8\nThe possible factorizations of 8 are:\n1. \\( 8 = 8 \\times 1 \\)\n2. \\( 8 = 4 \\times 2 \\)\n3. \\( 8 = 2 \\times 2 \\times 2 \\)\n\n### Step 6: Corresponding \\( n \\) for Each Factorization\n1. **Case 1: \\( 8 = 8 \\times 1 \\)**\n   \\[\n   n = p_1^7\n   \\]\n   The smallest prime is 2, so:\n   \\[\n   n = 2^7 = 128\n   \\]\n\n2. **Case 2: \\( 8 = 4 \\times 2 \\)**\n   \\[\n   n = p_1^3 p_2^1\n   \\]\n   The smallest primes are 2 and 3, so:\n   \\[\n   n = 2^3 \\times 3 = 8 \\times 3 = 24\n   \\]\n\n3. **Case 3: \\( 8 = 2 \\times 2 \\times 2 \\)**\n   \\[\n   n = p_1^1 p_2^1 p_3^1\n   \\]\n   The smallest primes are 2, 3, and 5, so:\n   \\[\n   n = 2 \\times 3 \\times 5 = 30\n   \\]\n\n### Step 7: Verifying the Smallest \\( n \\)\nAmong the values 128, 24, and 30, the smallest \\( n \\) is 24.\n\n### Step 8: Verification\nFor \\( n = 24 \\):\n- The divisors of 24 are: 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, 24.\n- The number of divisors \\( d \\) is 8.\n- The product of the divisors is:\n  \\[\n  1 \\times 2 \\times 3 \\times 4 \\times 6 \\times 8 \\times 12 \\times 24 = 24^4\n  \\]\n  This confirms that the product of the divisors of 24 is indeed \\( 24^4 \\).\n\nThus, the least integer \\( n > 1 \\) such that the product of all positive divisors of \\( n \\) equals \\( n^4 \\) is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{24}\n\\]"], "id": 2977, "generated_answers": ["24"], "gold_answer": "24", "is_correct": true, "answers_correctness": [true]}
{"question": "Each of the six faces of a cube is randomly colored red or blue with equal probability. Compute the probability that no three faces of the same color share a common vertex.", "generated_responses": ["To solve the problem, we need to determine the probability that no three faces of the same color share a common vertex in a cube where each face is colored red or blue with equal probability.\n\n### Step 1: Total Number of Colorings\nEach face of the cube can be either red or blue. Since there are 6 faces, the total number of possible colorings is:\n\\[\n2^6 = 64\n\\]\n\n### Step 2: Counting Valid Colorings\nWe need to count the number of colorings where no three faces of the same color share a common vertex. We will use a combinatorial approach to count these valid colorings.\n\n#### Case 1: All faces are the same color\nThere are 2 such colorings: all faces red or all faces blue. In both cases, all three faces of the same color share a common vertex, so these are not valid.\n\n#### Case 2: Five faces are one color, and one face is the other color\nThere are 6 ways to choose which face is the different color. For each choice, there are 2 colorings (one for each color of the different face). Thus, there are:\n\\[\n6 \\times 2 = 12\n\\]\nHowever, in all these cases, the five faces of the same color will share a common vertex, so these are not valid.\n\n#### Case 3: Four faces are one color, and two faces are the other color\nWe need to ensure that no three faces of the same color share a common vertex. The only valid configuration is when the two faces of the different color are opposite each other. There are 3 pairs of opposite faces, and for each pair, there are 2 colorings (one for each color of the different faces). Thus, there are:\n\\[\n3 \\times 2 = 6\n\\]\n\n#### Case 4: Three faces are one color, and three faces are the other color\nWe need to ensure that no three faces of the same color share a common vertex. The only valid configuration is when the three faces of one color form a \"belt\" around the cube, and the three faces of the other color are the opposite faces. There are 2 ways to choose which color forms the belt, and for each choice, there is 1 way to arrange the faces. Thus, there are:\n\\[\n2 \\times 1 = 2\n\\]\n\n### Step 3: Total Number of Valid Colorings\nSumming up the valid colorings from all cases:\n\\[\n6 + 2 = 8\n\\]\n\n### Step 4: Probability Calculation\nThe probability that no three faces of the same color share a common vertex is the number of valid colorings divided by the total number of colorings:\n\\[\n\\frac{8}{64} = \\frac{1}{8}\n\\]\n\nThus, the final answer is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{\\frac{1}{8}}\n\\]"], "id": 2978, "generated_answers": ["\\frac{1}{8}"], "gold_answer": "$\\frac{9}{32}$", "is_correct": false, "answers_correctness": [false]}

Compute the number of noncongruent triangles that can be formed in this manner.", "generated_responses": ["To solve the problem, we need to determine the number of noncongruent triangles that can be formed by extending three sides of a regular 16-gon. Let's break down the problem step by step.\n\n### Step 1: Understanding the Geometry\nA regular 16-gon has 16 vertices and 16 sides. We need to extend three of its sides to form a triangle. The vertices of the triangle will not lie on the 16-gon itself, but rather on the extensions of its sides.\n\n### Step 2: Identifying the Possible Triangles\nTo form a triangle, we need to select three sides of the 16-gon such that their extensions intersect to form a triangle. We can categorize the triangles based on the number of sides of the 16-gon that are involved in the formation of the triangle.\n\n### Step 3: Counting the Triangles\nWe will count the number of noncongruent triangles by considering the different configurations of the sides of the 16-gon.\n\n#### Case 1: Triangles formed by 3 consecutive sides\n- If we extend three consecutive sides, the triangle formed will be the same for all such sets of three consecutive sides. This is because the 16-gon is regular, and all such triangles are congruent.\n- There are 16 such sets of three consecutive sides, but they all form the same type of triangle.\n\n#### Case 2: Triangles formed by 3 sides with one side in between\n- If we extend three sides such that one side is in between the other two, we can form different types of triangles.\n- For example, if we extend sides \\(A_1A_2\\), \\(A_3A_4\\), and \\(A_5A_6\\), the triangle formed will be different from the triangle formed by extending sides \\(A_1A_2\\), \\(A_4A_5\\), and \\(A_6A_7\\).\n- We need to count the number of such distinct configurations.\n\n#### Case 3: Triangles formed by 3 sides with two sides in between\n- If we extend three sides such that two sides are in between the other two, we can form even more different types of triangles.\n- For example, if we extend sides \\(A_1A_2\\), \\(A_4A_5\\), and \\(A_7A_8\\), the triangle formed will be different from the triangle formed by extending sides \\(A_1A_2\\), \\(A_5A_6\\), and \\(A_8A_9\\).\n- We need to count the number of such distinct configurations.\n\n### Step 4: Counting the Noncongruent Triangles\n- From the above cases, we can see that the triangles formed by 3 consecutive sides are all congruent.\n- The triangles formed by 3 sides with one side in between can be divided into 4 distinct types based on the number of sides in between.\n- The triangles formed by 3 sides with two sides in between can be divided into 2 distinct types based on the number of sides in between.\n\n### Step 5: Summing Up the Noncongruent Triangles\n- From the above analysis, we have:\n  - 1 type of triangle from 3 consecutive sides.\n  - 4 types of triangles from 3 sides with one side in between.\n  - 2 types of triangles from 3 sides with two sides in between.\n\nThus, the total number of noncongruent triangles is:\n\\[ 1 + 4 + 2 = 7 \\]\n\nHowever, we need to consider the symmetry and the fact that the 16-gon is regular.
