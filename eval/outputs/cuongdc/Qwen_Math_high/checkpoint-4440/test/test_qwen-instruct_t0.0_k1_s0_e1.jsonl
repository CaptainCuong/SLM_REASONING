{"question": "If $f(x)$ is a polynomial of degree 7, and $g(x)$ is a polynomial of degree 7, then what is the product of the minimum and the maximum possible degrees of $f(x) + g(x)$?", "generated_responses": ["To solve the problem, we need to determine the possible degrees of the polynomial \\( f(x) + g(x) \\) when \\( f(x) \\) and \\( g(x) \\) are both polynomials of degree 7.\n\n### Step 1: Understanding the Degrees of Polynomials\n- The degree of a polynomial is the highest power of \\( x \\) with a non-zero coefficient.\n- If \\( f(x) \\) and \\( g(x) \\) are both polynomials of degree 7, then the leading terms of \\( f(x) \\) and \\( g(x) \\) are of the form \\( a_7 x^7 \\) and \\( b_7 x^7 \\), respectively, where \\( a_7 \\) and \\( b_7 \\) are non-zero constants.\n\n### Step 2: Degree of \\( f(x) + g(x) \\)\n- The degree of \\( f(x) + g(x) \\) depends on the coefficients of the leading terms of \\( f(x) \\) and \\( g(x) \\).\n- The leading term of \\( f(x) + g(x) \\) will be \\( (a_7 + b_7) x^7 \\).\n\n### Step 3: Possible Degrees of \\( f(x) + g(x) \\)\n- **Maximum Degree**: The maximum degree of \\( f(x) + g(x) \\) occurs when the leading coefficients \\( a_7 \\) and \\( b_7 \\) are both non-zero and have the same sign. In this case, the degree of \\( f(x) + g(x) \\) is 7.\n- **Minimum Degree**: The minimum degree of \\( f(x) + g(x) \\) occurs when the leading coefficients \\( a_7 \\) and \\( b_7 \\) are non-zero but have opposite signs, and their sum is zero. In this case, the degree of \\( f(x) + g(x) \\) is less than 7. The lowest possible degree is 0, which occurs if \\( f(x) + g(x) \\) is a constant polynomial.\n\n### Step 4: Product of the Minimum and Maximum Degrees\n- The maximum degree of \\( f(x) + g(x) \\) is 7.\n- The minimum degree of \\( f(x) + g(x) \\) is 0.\n- The product of the minimum and maximum degrees is \\( 7 \\times 0 = 0 \\).\n\nThus, the product of the minimum and maximum possible degrees of \\( f(x) + g(x) \\) is \\(\\boxed{0}\\)."], "id": "1", "generated_answers": ["0"], "gold_answer": "0", "is_correct": true, "answers_correctness": [true]}
