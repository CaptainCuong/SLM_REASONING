{"question": "If $f(x)$ is a polynomial of degree 7, and $g(x)$ is a polynomial of degree 7, then what is the product of the minimum and the maximum possible degrees of $f(x) + g(x)$?", "generated_responses": ["To determine the product of the minimum and maximum possible degrees of \\( f(x) + g(x) \\) where \\( f(x) \\) and \\( g(x) \\) are polynomials of degree 7, we need to analyze the degrees of the sum of these polynomials.\n\n### Step 1: Maximum Possible Degree of \\( f(x) + g(x) \\)\nThe maximum possible degree of \\( f(x) + g(x) \\) occurs when the leading terms of \\( f(x) \\) and \\( g(x) \\) do not cancel each other out. Since both \\( f(x) \\) and \\( g(x) \\) are polynomials of degree 7, the leading term of \\( f(x) \\) is \\( a_7 x^7 \\) and the leading term of \\( g(x) \\) is \\( b_7 x^7 \\). If \\( a_7 \\) and \\( b_7 \\) are not zero and do not cancel each other out, the leading term of \\( f(x) + g(x) \\) will be \\( (a_7 + b_7) x^7 \\), which is a polynomial of degree 7.\n\nThus, the maximum possible degree of \\( f(x) + g(x) \\) is 7.\n\n### Step 2: Minimum Possible Degree of \\( f(x) + g(x) \\)\nThe minimum possible degree of \\( f(x) + g(x) \\) occurs when the leading terms of \\( f(x) \\) and \\( g(x) \\) exactly cancel each other out. In this case, the leading term of \\( f(x) + g(x) \\) will be zero, and the polynomial \\( f(x) + g(x) \\) will be a polynomial of a lower degree. The lowest possible degree of a non-zero polynomial is 0 (a constant polynomial).\n\nThus, the minimum possible degree of \\( f(x) + g(x) \\) is 0.\n\n### Step 3: Product of the Minimum and Maximum Possible Degrees\nThe product of the minimum and maximum possible degrees of \\( f(x) + g(x) \\) is:\n\\[\n7 \\times 0 = 0\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{0}\n\\]"], "id": "1", "generated_answers": ["0"], "gold_answer": "0", "is_correct": true, "answers_correctness": [true]}
