{"question": "If $f(x)$ is a polynomial of degree 7, and $g(x)$ is a polynomial of degree 7, then what is the product of the minimum and the maximum possible degrees of $f(x) + g(x)$?", "generated_responses": ["To determine the product of the minimum and the maximum possible degrees of \\( f(x) + g(x) \\) where \\( f(x) \\) and \\( g(x) \\) are polynomials of degree 7, we need to analyze the behavior of the sum of these polynomials.\n\n### Step 1: Understanding the Degrees of Polynomials\n- A polynomial \\( f(x) \\) of degree 7 can be written as:\n  \\[\n  f(x) = a_7 x^7 + a_6 x^6 + \\cdots + a_1 x + a_0\n  \\]\n  where \\( a_7 \\neq 0 \\).\n- Similarly, a polynomial \\( g(x) \\) of degree 7 can be written as:\n  \\[\n  g(x) = b_7 x^7 + b_6 x^6 + \\cdots + b_1 x + b_0\n  \\]\n  where \\( b_7 \\neq 0 \\).\n\n### Step 2: Sum of Two Polynomials\nThe sum of \\( f(x) \\) and \\( g(x) \\) is:\n\\[\nf(x) + g(x) = (a_7 + b_7) x^7 + (a_6 + b_6) x^6 + \\cdots + (a_1 + b_1) x + (a_0 + b_0)\n\\]\n\n### Step 3: Maximum Degree of \\( f(x) + g(x) \\)\n- The maximum degree of \\( f(x) + g(x) \\) occurs when the leading coefficients \\( a_7 \\) and \\( b_7 \\) do not cancel each other out. In this case, the degree of \\( f(x) + g(x) \\) is 7.\n- Therefore, the maximum possible degree of \\( f(x) + g(x) \\) is 7.\n\n### Step 4: Minimum Degree of \\( f(x) + g(x) \\)\n- The minimum degree of \\( f(x) + g(x) \\) occurs when the leading coefficients \\( a_7 \\) and \\( b_7 \\) cancel each other out. In this case, the degree of \\( f(x) + g(x) \\) is less than 7.\n- If \\( a_7 + b_7 = 0 \\), then the leading term \\( x^7 \\) disappears, and the next highest degree term, \\( x^6 \\), becomes the leading term if \\( a_6 + b_6 \\neq 0 \\). If \\( a_6 + b_6 = 0 \\), we continue this process until we find the first non-zero coefficient.\n- The minimum possible degree of \\( f(x) + g(x) \\) is 0, which occurs when all coefficients of \\( f(x) + g(x) \\) are zero, i.e., \\( f(x) = -g(x) \\).\n\n### Step 5: Product of the Minimum and Maximum Degrees\n- The maximum degree of \\( f(x) + g(x) \\) is 7.\n- The minimum degree of \\( f(x) + g(x) \\) is 0.\n- The product of the minimum and maximum degrees is:\n  \\[\n  7 \\times 0 = 0\n  \\]\n\nThus, the product of the minimum and the maximum possible degrees of \\( f(x) + g(x) \\) is \\(\\boxed{0}\\)."], "id": "1", "generated_answers": ["0"], "gold_answer": "0", "is_correct": true, "answers_correctness": [true]}
