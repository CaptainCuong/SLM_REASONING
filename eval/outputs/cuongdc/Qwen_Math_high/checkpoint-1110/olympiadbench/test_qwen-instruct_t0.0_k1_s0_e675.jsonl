We can use the principle of symmetry in binary strings to count the number of even and odd weight numbers.\n\n### Step 4: Symmetry in Binary Strings\nIn a 2017-bit binary string, each bit can be either 0 or 1. The total number of 2017-bit binary strings is \\(2^{2017}\\). By symmetry, the number of strings with an even number of 1s is equal to the number of strings with an odd number of 1s. This is because for every string with an even number of 1s, there is a corresponding string with an odd number of 1s obtained by flipping all the bits.\n\n### Step 5: Calculating the Difference\nSince the total number of 2017-bit binary strings is \\(2^{2017}\\), and half of them have an even number of 1s and the other half have an odd number of 1s, the number of even weight numbers is:\n\\[\n\\frac{2^{2017}}{2} = 2^{2016}\n\\]\nSimilarly, the number of odd weight numbers is also:\n\\[\n\\frac{2^{2017}}{2} = 2^{2016}\n\\]\n\n### Step 6: Finding the Difference\nThe difference between the number of even weight numbers and the number of odd weight numbers is:\n\\[\n2^{2016} - 2^{2016} = 0\n\\]\n\nThus, the final answer is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{0}\n\\]"], "id": 1612, "generated_answers": ["0"], "gold_answer": "$2^{1009}$", "is_correct": false, "answers_correctness": [false]}

Let's break down the problem step by step.\n\n### Step 1: Understanding the Constraints\n1. **No King Can Capture Another**: This means no two kings can be placed in squares that share a common vertex. In other words, no two kings can be adjacent horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.\n2. **Each Row and Each Column Contains Exactly 25 Kings**: This means we need to place 25 kings in each row and each column.\n\n### Step 2: Placing Kings in a Row\nTo satisfy the condition that no two kings can capture each other, we need to place the kings in such a way that they are not adjacent. One way to do this is to place the kings in every fourth square, starting from the first square in the row. This ensures that no two kings are adjacent.\n\nFor example, in the first row, we can place kings in the following positions:\n\\[ (1, 1), (1, 5), (1, 9), \\ldots, (1, 97) \\]\n\nThis pattern can be repeated for each row. Since there are 100 rows, we can place 25 kings in each row by following this pattern.\n\n### Step 3: Ensuring Each Column Contains Exactly 25 Kings\nTo ensure that each column also contains exactly 25 kings, we need to place the kings in a similar pattern but shifted by 4 columns for each subsequent row. This is because placing kings in every fourth column in each row will ensure that each column also contains exactly 25 kings.\n\nFor example, in the second row, we can place kings in the following positions:\n\\[ (2, 5), (2, 9), (2, 13), \\ldots, (2, 97) \\]\n\nThis pattern can be repeated for each row, shifting by 4 columns for each subsequent row.\n\n### Step 4: Verifying the Solution\nBy following this pattern, we can place 25 kings in each row and each column, and no two kings will be adjacent. This ensures that no king can capture any other king.\n\n### Step 5: Counting the Number of Arrangements\nSince the pattern is fixed and there is only one way to place the kings in each row and each column while satisfying the given conditions, there is only one unique arrangement.\n\nThus, the number of such arrangements is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{1}\n\\]"], "id": 1724, "generated_answers": ["1"], "gold_answer": "2", "is_correct": false, "answers_correctness": [false]}

Find the largest among them.", "generated_responses": ["To solve the problem, we need to determine the largest integer \\( m \\) that is not \\( n \\)-colourful. We will proceed step by step.\n\n### Step 1: Understanding the Problem\nAn integer \\( m \\geq n+1 \\) is called \\( n \\)-colourful if, given infinitely many marbles in each of \\( n \\) colours \\( C_1, C_2, \\ldots, C_n \\), it is possible to place \\( m \\) of them around a circle such that in any group of \\( n+1 \\) consecutive marbles, there is at least one marble of each colour \\( C_i \\) for \\( i = 1, \\ldots, n \\).\n\n### Step 2: Constructing a Valid Configuration\nTo construct a valid configuration, we need to ensure that in any group of \\( n+1 \\) consecutive marbles, all \\( n \\) colours are present. One way to achieve this is to use a repeating pattern of \\( n \\) colours. For example, if we have \\( n \\) colours, we can place them in a repeating sequence such as \\( C_1, C_2, \\ldots, C_n, C_1, C_2, \\ldots, C_n, \\ldots \\).\n\n### Step 3: Determining the Minimum \\( m \\)\nTo ensure that any group of \\( n+1 \\) consecutive marbles contains all \\( n \\) colours, we need to place at least \\( n \\) marbles of each colour. Therefore, the minimum number of marbles required is \\( n \\times n = n^2 \\).\n\n### Step 4: Proving \\( m = n^2 \\) is \\( n \\)-colourful\nWe can place \\( n^2 \\) marbles in a repeating sequence of \\( n \\) colours. For example, if \\( n = 3 \\), the sequence would be \\( C_1, C_2, C_3, C_1, C_2, C_3, \\ldots \\). In any group of \\( n+1 = 4 \\) consecutive marbles, we will always have at least one marble of each colour \\( C_1, C_2, \\) and \\( C_3 \\).\n\n### Step 5: Proving \\( m = n^2 - 1 \\) is Not \\( n \\)-colourful\nTo show that \\( m = n^2 - 1 \\) is not \\( n \\)-colourful, consider the following:\n- If we have \\( n^2 - 1 \\) marbles, we can place \\( n-1 \\) marbles of each colour.\n- In this case, we can place the marbles in a sequence such that one colour is missing in any group of \\( n+1 \\) consecutive marbles.\n\nFor example, if \\( n = 3 \\), we can place \\( 8 \\) marbles in the sequence \\( C_1, C_1, C_1, C_2, C_2, C_2, C_3, C_3 \\). In this sequence, any group of \\( 4 \\) consecutive marbles will not contain all three colours.\n\n### Step 6: Conclusion\nThus, the largest integer \\( m \\) that is not \\( n \\)-colourful is \\( n^2 - 1 \\).\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{n^2 - 1}\n\\]"], "id": 1782, "generated_answers": ["n^2 - 1"], "gold_answer": "$m_{\\max }=n^{2}-n-1$", "is_correct": false, "answers_correctness": [false]}

This means that no two rows can be too similar in terms of their values in any column.\n\n### Step 3: Using the Pigeonhole Principle\nConsider the possible values in each column. Each column can contain any of the 100 numbers, but we need to ensure that the difference condition is met. If we have more than 50 rows, then by the pigeonhole principle, at least two rows must have the same number in at least one column. This would violate Property (ii) because the difference between the same number is 0, which is less than 2.\n\n### Step 4: Constructing a Valid Table with 50 Rows\nWe can construct a table with 50 rows where each row is a permutation of the numbers 1, 2, ..., 100 such that no two rows have the same number in the same column. This can be done by using a Latin square of order 100, which is a 100x100 array filled with 100 different symbols, each occurring exactly once in each row and exactly once in each column.\n\n### Step 5: Verifying the Construction\nIn a Latin square, each row is a permutation of the numbers 1, 2, ..., 100, and no two rows have the same number in the same column. Therefore, for any two distinct rows \\( r \\) and \\( s \\), there is always a column \\( c \\) such that \\( |T(r, c) - T(s, c)| \\geq 2 \\). This is because if \\( T(r, c) = T(s, c) \\), then \\( |T(r, c) - T(s, c)| = 0 \\), which is not possible in a Latin square.\n\n### Conclusion\nThe largest \\( N \\) for which there exists a table \\( T \\) of integers with \\( N \\) rows and 100 columns that satisfies the given properties is 50.\n\nThus, the final answer is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{50}\n\\]"], "id": 1789, "generated_answers": ["50"], "gold_answer": "$\\frac{100!}{2^{50}}$", "is_correct": false, "answers_correctness": [false]}

There are \\(\\binom{5}{2} = 10\\) such ratios. We need to find the smallest \\( C \\) such that among these 10 ratios, there are two ratios whose absolute difference is at most \\( C \\).\n\n### Step 3: Use the Pigeonhole Principle\nTo apply the pigeonhole principle, we need to divide the interval \\((0, \\infty)\\) into subintervals and show that at least two of the ratios must fall into the same subinterval.\n\n### Step 4: Divide the Interval\nDivide the interval \\((0, \\infty)\\) into 5 subintervals of equal length. Let the subintervals be:\n\\[\n(0, 1), [1, 2), [2, 3), [3, 4), [4, \\infty).\n\\]\n\n### Step 5: Apply the Pigeonhole Principle\nSince there are 10 ratios and only 5 subintervals, by the pigeonhole principle, at least two of these ratios must fall into the same subinterval. Let these two ratios be \\( \\frac{a_i}{a_j} \\) and \\( \\frac{a_k}{a_l} \\).\n\n### Step 6: Calculate the Maximum Difference\nThe maximum difference between any two ratios in the same subinterval is the length of the subinterval. The length of each subinterval is 1. Therefore, the maximum difference between any two ratios in the same subinterval is 1.\n\n### Step 7: Consider the Case of Ratios in Different Subintervals\nIf the two ratios \\( \\frac{a_i}{a_j} \\) and \\( \\frac{a_k}{a_l} \\) are in different subintervals, the maximum difference between them is the sum of the lengths of the subintervals between them. The maximum distance between any two subintervals is 3 (from \\((0, 1)\\) to \\([4, \\infty)\\)).\n\n### Step 8: Refine the Bound\nTo refine the bound, consider the specific case where the ratios are in the subintervals \\((0, 1)\\) and \\([1, 2)\\). The maximum difference between a ratio in \\((0, 1)\\) and a ratio in \\([1, 2)\\) is 1. However, we need to consider the possibility of ratios in other subintervals.\n\n### Step 9: Use the Golden Ratio\nThe golden ratio \\(\\phi = \\frac{1 + \\sqrt{5}}{2}\\) is known to be the most irrational number, and it can be used to show that the maximum difference between any two ratios in the same subinterval is \\(\\frac{1}{2}(\\sqrt{5} - 1)\\).\n\n### Step 10: Verify the Bound\nBy considering the specific case where the ratios are in the subintervals \\((0, 1)\\) and \\([1, 2)\\), we can show that the maximum difference is indeed \\(\\frac{1}{2}(\\sqrt{5} - 1)\\).\n\n### Conclusion\nThus, the smallest real constant \\( C \\) such that for any positive real numbers \\( a_1, a_2, a_3, a_4, a_5 \\), one can always choose distinct subscripts \\( i, j, k, l \\) such that\n\n\\[\n\\left| \\frac{a_i}{a_j} - \\frac{a_k}{a_l} \\right| \\leq C\n\\]\n\nis\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{\\frac{1}{2}(\\sqrt{5} - 1)}.\n\\]"], "id": 1838, "generated_answers": ["\\frac{1}{2}(\\sqrt{5} - 1)"], "gold_answer": "$\\frac{1}{2}$", "is_correct": false, "answers_correctness": [false]}

The sum of each row and each column must be:\n\\[\nS = \\frac{\\sigma(n)}{k}\n\\]\n\n### Step 5: Simplifying the Problem\nFor \\( n \\) to satisfy the conditions, \\( \\sigma(n) \\) must be divisible by \\( k \\).

The key is to place the marked cells in a way that they block certain domino placements, leading to a unique solution.\n\n### Step 4: Constructing a Solution\nConsider placing the marked cells in a specific pattern. One effective pattern is to place the marked cells in a checkerboard pattern, but with a twist. We can place the marked cells in a way that they form a \"staircase\" pattern, which will force the dominoes to be placed in a unique way.\n\n### Step 5: Analyzing the Staircase Pattern\nLet's place the marked cells in a staircase pattern starting from the top-left corner. For example, for \\( n = 2 \\), the board is \\( 4 \\times 4 \\), and we can place the marked cells as follows:\n\\[\n\\begin{array}{|c|c|c|c|}\n\\hline\nM &   & M &   \\\\\n\\hline\n  & M &   & M \\\\\n\\hline\nM &   & M &   \\\\\n\\hline\n  & M &   & M \\\\\n\\hline\n\\end{array}\n\\]\nThis pattern ensures that there is a unique way to cover the board with dominoes, and no domino covers two marked cells.\n\n### Step 6: Generalizing the Pattern\nFor a \\( 2n \\times 2n \\) board, we can place the marked cells in a similar staircase pattern. The number of marked cells in this pattern is \\( 2n \\).\n\n### Step 7: Verifying the Solution\nTo verify, consider the \\( 2n \\times 2n \\) board with \\( 2n \\) marked cells in the staircase pattern. Each marked cell forces the placement of a specific domino, and the remaining cells can be covered uniquely by dominoes. This ensures that there is a unique partition of the board into \\( 1 \\times 2 \\) and \\( 2 \\times 1 \\) dominoes.\n\n### Conclusion\nThe smallest positive integer \\( k \\) such that it is possible to mark \\( k \\) cells on a \\( 2n \\times 2n \\) board so that there exists a unique partition of the board into \\( 1 \\times 2 \\) and \\( 2 \\times 1 \\) dominoes, none of which contains two marked cells, is \\( 2n \\).\n\nThus, the final answer is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{2n}\n\\]"], "id": 1854, "generated_answers": ["2n"], "gold_answer": "$2 n$", "is_correct": true, "answers_correctness": [true]}

Every cell on the board is adjacent to exactly one cell covered by a domino.\n\n### Step 2: Analyzing the Board\nA \\(2n \\times 2n\\) board has \\(4n^2\\) cells. Each domino covers 2 cells, so if we place \\(k\\) dominoes, they will cover \\(2k\\) cells.

Therefore, the total number of adjacencies is \\(2k\\).\n\n### Step 4: Ensuring Each Cell is Adjacent to Exactly One Covered Cell\nFor each cell to be adjacent to exactly one covered cell, the total number of adjacencies must be equal to the number of cells on the board.

Each can paddle the kayak at $7 \\mathrm{~km} / \\mathrm{h}$ and swim at $2 \\mathrm{~km} / \\mathrm{h}$. They start from the same point at the same time with Amrita paddling and Zhang swimming. After a while, Amrita stops the kayak and immediately starts swimming. Upon reaching the kayak (which has not moved since Amrita started swimming), Zhang gets in and immediately starts paddling. They arrive on the far side of the lake at the same time, 90 minutes after they began.

Let's break down the problem step by step.\n\n1. **Define Variables:**\n   - Let \\( t_1 \\) be the time (in hours) that Amrita paddles the kayak.\n   - Let \\( t_2 \\) be the time (in hours) that Zhang paddles the kayak.\n   - Let \\( t_3 \\) be the time (in hours) that Amrita swims.\n   - Let \\( t_4 \\) be the time (in hours) that Zhang swims.\n\n2. **Total Time:**\n   - The total time for the trip is 90 minutes, which is \\( \\frac{90}{60} = 1.5 \\) hours.\n   - Therefore, \\( t_1 + t_2 + t_3 + t_4 = 1.5 \\).\n\n3. **Distance Traveled:**\n   - The distance traveled by the kayak is the same for both Amrita and Zhang.\n   - The distance traveled by the kayak while Amrita is paddling is \\( 7t_1 \\) km.\n   -

Compute the base-10 representation of $N$.", "generated_responses": ["To solve the problem, we need to find the smallest integer greater than 20 that is a palindrome in both base 20 and base 14. Let's proceed step by step.\n\n### Step 1: Understanding the Problem\nA number is a palindrome if it reads the same forwards and backwards. We need to find a number \\( N \\) such that:\n1. \\( N \\) is a palindrome in base 20.\n2. \\( N \\) is a palindrome in base 14.\n3. \\( N \\) is greater than 20.\n\n### Step 2: Palindromes in Base 20\nFirst, let's consider the form of a palindrome in base 20. A palindrome in base 20 can be:\n- A single digit (not possible since \\( N > 20 \\)).\n- A two-digit number \\( \\overline{ab} \\) where \\( a = b \\).\n- A three-digit number \\( \\overline{aba} \\).\n\nSince \\( N \\) must be greater than 20, we start with three-digit palindromes in base 20. A three-digit palindrome in base 20 can be written as:\n\\[ N = 20^2a + 20b + a = 400a + 20b + a = 401a + 20b \\]\n\n### Step 3: Palindromes in Base 14\nNext, we need \\( N \\) to be a palindrome in base 14. A palindrome in base 14 can be:\n- A single digit (not possible since \\( N > 20 \\)).\n- A two-digit number \\( \\overline{cd} \\) where \\( c = d \\).\n- A three-digit number \\( \\overline{cde} \\) where \\( c = e \\).\n\nSince \\( N \\) must be greater than 20, we start with three-digit palindromes in base 14. A three-digit palindrome in base 14 can be written as:\n\\[ N = 14^2c + 14d + c = 196c + 14d + c = 197c + 14d \\]\n\n### Step 4: Finding the Common Palindrome\nWe need to find \\( N \\) such that:\n\\[ 401a + 20b = 197c + 14d \\]\n\nWe will test values of \\( a \\) and \\( b \\) to find a corresponding \\( c \\) and \\( d \\) that satisfy this equation.\n\n#### Testing \\( a = 1 \\):\n\\[ 401 \\cdot 1 + 20b = 197c + 14d \\]\n\\[ 401 + 20b = 197c + 14d \\]\n\nWe need \\( 401 + 20b \\) to be a multiple of 14.

The center square is at position \\((4, 4)\\) (assuming the top-left corner is \\((1, 1)\\)).\n\n### Step 2: Determine the possible cuts\nA portion of the ARMLbar is a square section of the grid, cut along the gridlines. We need to consider all possible sizes of square portions that can be cut from the grid.\n\n### Step 3: Count the number of ways to cut each size of square portion\nFor a square portion of size \\(k \\times k\\), we need to count the number of positions where the top-left corner of the square can be placed. The top-left corner of the square can be placed at any position \\((i, j)\\) such that:\n- \\(1 \\leq i \\leq 8 - k\\)\n- \\(1 \\leq j \\leq 8 - k\\)\n\nThis is because the square must fit entirely within the \\(7 \\times 7\\) grid, and the center square is removed, which affects the count.\n\n### Step 4: Calculate the number of valid positions for each size\nFor each \\(k\\) from 1 to 7, we calculate the number of valid positions:\n- For \\(k = 1\\): \\(7 \\times 7 = 49\\) positions\n- For \\(k = 2\\): \\(6 \\times 6 = 36\\) positions\n- For \\(k = 3\\): \\(5 \\times 5 = 25\\) positions\n- For \\(k = 4\\): \\(4 \\times 4 = 16\\) positions\n- For \\(k = 5\\): \\(3 \\times 3 = 9\\) positions\n- For \\(k = 6\\): \\(2 \\times 2 = 4\\) positions\n- For \\(k = 7\\): \\(1 \\times 1 = 1\\) position\n\n### Step 5: Sum the number of valid positions for all sizes\nThe total number of different ways to cut a single portion from the ARMLbar is the sum of the number of valid positions for each size:\n\\[\n49 + 36 + 25 + 16 + 9 + 4 + 1 = 140\n\\]\n\nThus, the number of different ways to cut a single portion from an ARMLbar is \\(\\boxed{140}\\)."], "id": 2664, "generated_answers": ["140"], "gold_answer": "96", "is_correct": false, "answers_correctness": [false]}

Let's break this down step by step.\n\n### Step 1: Understanding \\( C(n) \\)\nFor a given integer \\( n \\), \\( C(n) \\) counts the number of pairs of consecutive 1's in its binary representation. For example:\n- \\( 183_{10} = 10110111_2 \\)\n- \\( C(183) = 3 \\) (since there are three pairs of consecutive 1's: 1011, 1011, and 111)\n\n### Step 2: Analyzing the Binary Representation\nWe need to consider the binary representations of all numbers from 1 to 256. The binary representation of 256 is \\( 100000000_2 \\), which is 9 bits long. Therefore, we will consider all numbers with up to 9 bits.\n\n### Step 3: Counting Pairs of Consecutive 1's\nTo count the pairs of consecutive 1's, we can use a combinatorial approach. We will count the number of times a pair of consecutive 1's appears in all possible binary numbers of length up to 9 bits.\n\n### Step 4: Using a Recursive Approach\nLet \\( a_n \\) be the number of binary numbers of length \\( n \\) that end in 0, and \\( b_n \\) be the number of binary numbers of length \\( n \\) that end in 1. We can use the following recurrence relations:\n- \\( a_{n+1} = a_n + b_n \\) (since a number of length \\( n+1 \\) that ends in 0 can be formed by appending 0 to any number of length \\( n \\))\n- \\( b_{n+1} = a_n \\) (since a number of length \\( n+1 \\) that ends in 1 can only be formed by appending 1 to a number of length \\( n \\) that ends in 0)\n\n### Step 5: Counting Pairs of Consecutive 1's\nTo count the pairs of consecutive 1's, we need to consider the positions where a 1 can be followed by another 1. For a number of length \\( n \\), the number of pairs of consecutive 1's is the number of 1's in the first \\( n-1 \\) positions.\n\n### Step 6: Summing Over All Lengths\nWe sum the number of pairs of consecutive 1's for all lengths from 2 to 9 (since a number of length 1 cannot have consecutive 1's).\n\n### Step 7: Calculating the Total\nWe calculate the total number of pairs of consecutive 1's for each length and sum them up:\n- For length 2: \\( 1 \\) pair (11)\n- For length 3: \\( 2 \\) pairs (110, 111)\n- For length 4: \\( 4 \\) pairs (1100, 1101, 1110, 1111)\n- For length 5: \\( 8 \\) pairs\n- For length 6: \\( 16 \\) pairs\n- For length 7: \\( 32 \\) pairs\n- For length 8: \\( 64 \\) pairs\n- For length 9: \\( 128 \\) pairs\n\nSumming these values:\n\\[\n1 + 2 + 4 + 8 + 16 + 32 + 64 + 128 = 255\n\\]\n\n### Step 8: Final Calculation\nWe need to multiply this sum by the number of such pairs in each length, which is the number of binary numbers of length \\( n \\) that end in 1. The total number of such pairs is:\n\\[\n\\sum_{n=2}^{9} (2^{n-1} - 1) = 255\n\\]\n\nThus, the final sum is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{800}\n\\]"], "id": 2672, "generated_answers": ["800"], "gold_answer": "448", "is_correct": false, "answers_correctness": [false]}

Given that the numbers he carves sum to 17 , compute the number of different tables he can make.", "generated_responses": ["To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of distinct circular arrangements of positive integers that sum to 17. We will use the concept of necklaces (circular permutations) and the properties of divisors to find the solution.\n\n### Step 1: Identify the possible number of integers\nFirst, we need to determine the possible number of integers \\( n \\) that can sum to 17. The smallest integer is 1, and the largest integer is 17. We need to find all combinations of \\( n \\) integers that sum to 17.\n\n### Step 2: Use the properties of necklaces\nFor a circular arrangement of \\( n \\) integers, the number of distinct arrangements is given by the number of necklaces of length \\( n \\) with a sum of 17.

This is a combinatorial problem that can be solved using the concept of generating functions or the Polya enumeration theorem. However, for simplicity, we can use the fact that the number of such necklaces is given by the number of partitions of 17 into 17 parts, which is 1 (since the only way to partition 17 into 17 parts is to have 17 ones).\n\n### Step 4: Sum the number of distinct necklaces\nThe total number of distinct tables is the sum of the number of distinct necklaces for each possible \\( n \\):\n- For \\( n = 1 \\): 1 necklace\n- For \\( n = 17 \\): 1 necklace\n\nThus, the total number of distinct tables is:\n\\[\n1 + 1 = 2\n\\]\n\nHowever, we need to consider the additional cases where \\( n \\) is a divisor of 17 and the sum of the integers is 17. We need to count the number of distinct necklaces for each \\( n \\) that is a divisor of 17.\n\n### Step 5: Consider the cases for \\( n \\) being a divisor of 17\n- **Case \\( n = 1 \\)**: 1 necklace\n- **Case \\( n = 17 \\)**: 1 necklace\n- **Case \\( n = 2 \\)**: We need to find the number of distinct necklaces of length 2 that sum to 17. The only possible arrangement is (8, 9), which is 1 necklace.\n- **Case \\( n = 17 \\)**: 1 necklace\n\n### Step 6: Sum the number of distinct necklaces\nThe total number of distinct tables is the sum of the number of distinct necklaces for each possible \\( n \\):\n\\[\n1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1"], "id": 2767, "generated_answers": [""], "gold_answer": "7711", "is_correct": false, "answers_correctness": [false]}

{"question": "An $\\boldsymbol{n}$-label is a permutation of the numbers 1 through $n$. For example, $J=35214$ is a 5 -label and $K=132$ is a 3 -label. For a fixed positive integer $p$, where $p \\leq n$, consider consecutive blocks of $p$ numbers in an $n$-label. For example, when $p=3$ and $L=263415$, the blocks are 263,634,341, and 415. We can associate to each of these blocks a $p$-label that corresponds to the relative order of the numbers in that block. For $L=263415$, we get the following:\n\n$$\n\\underline{263} 415 \\rightarrow 132 ; \\quad 2 \\underline{63415} \\rightarrow 312 ; \\quad 26 \\underline{341} 5 \\rightarrow 231 ; \\quad 263 \\underline{415} \\rightarrow 213\n$$\n\nMoving from left to right in the $n$-label, there are $n-p+1$ such blocks, which means we obtain an $(n-p+1)$-tuple of $p$-labels. For $L=263415$, we get the 4 -tuple $(132,312,231,213)$. We will call this $(n-p+1)$-tuple the $\\boldsymbol{p}$-signature of $L$ (or signature, if $p$ is clear from the context) and denote it by $S_{p}[L]$; the $p$-labels in the signature are called windows. For $L=263415$, the windows are $132,312,231$, and 213 , and we write\n\n$$\nS_{3}[263415]=(132,312,231,213)\n$$\n\nMore generally, we will call any $(n-p+1)$-tuple of $p$-labels a $p$-signature, even if we do not know of an $n$-label to which it corresponds (and even if no such label exists). A signature that occurs for exactly one $n$-label is called unique, and a signature that doesn't occur for any $n$-labels is called impossible.

The side length \\(s\\) of the square can be found using the formula for the area of a square:\n\\[\ns^2 = 650 \\implies s = \\sqrt{650} = 5\\sqrt{26}\n\\]\n\n### Step 2: Find the coordinates of the vertices of the square\nLet the vertices of the square be \\(P, Q, R, S\\) in clockwise order, with \\(A\\) being the midpoint of \\(PQ\\). Since \\(A\\) is at \\((11, 5)\\), we can express the coordinates of \\(P\\) and \\(Q\\) as:\n\\[\nP = (x_1, y_1) \\quad \\text{and} \\quad Q = (x_2, y_2)\n\\]\nThe midpoint formula gives:\n\\[\n\\left( \\frac{x_1 + x_2}{2}, \\frac{y_1 + y_2}{2} \\right) = (11, 5)\n\\]\nThus, we have:\n\\[\n\\frac{x_1 + x_2}{2} = 11 \\implies x_1 + x_2 = 22\n\\]\n\\[\n\\frac{y_1 + y_2}{2} = 5 \\implies y_1 + y_2 = 10\n\\]\n\n### Step 3: Use the side length to find the coordinates of \\(R\\) and \\(L\\)\nThe distance between \\(P\\) and \\(Q\\) is \\(5\\sqrt{26}\\). Using the distance formula:\n\\[\n\\sqrt{(x_2 - x_1)^2 + (y_2 - y_1)^2} = 5\\sqrt{26}\n\\]\nSquaring both sides:\n\\[\n(x_2 - x_1)^2 + (y_2 - y_1)^2 = 650\n\\]\n\n### Step 4: Express \\(R\\) and \\(L\\) in terms of \\(P\\) and \\(Q\\)\nSince \\(R\\) and \\(L\\) are midpoints of the other sides, we can express their coordinates as:\n\\[\nR = \\left( \\frac{x_2 + x_3}{2}, \\frac{y_2 + y_3}{2} \\right) \\quad \\text{and} \\quad L = \\left( \\frac{x_3 + x_1}{2}, \\frac{y_3 + y_1}{2} \\right)\n\\]\nwhere \\(x_3\\) and \\(y_3\\) are the coordinates of the third vertex of the square.\n\n### Step 5: Use the properties of the square to find \\(R\\)\nSince \\(R\\) is in Quadrant I, both \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) coordinates of \\(R\\) must be positive.

Let's break down the problem step by step.\n\n### Step 1: Understanding \\(s(n)\\)\nFor a number \\(n\\) with digits \\(d_k, d_{k-1}, \\ldots, d_1, d_0\\), we can express \\(n\\) as:\n\\[ n = d_k \\cdot 10^k + d_{k-1} \\cdot 10^{k-1} + \\cdots + d_1 \\cdot 10 + d_0 \\]\nThe sum of the digits of \\(n\\) is:\n\\[ d_k + d_{k-1} + \\cdots + d_1 + d_0 \\]\nThus, the function \\(s(n)\\) is:\n\\[ s(n) = n + (d_k + d_{k-1} + \\cdots + d_1 + d_0) \\]\n\n### Step 2: Range of \\(s(n)\\) for \\(n\\) from 0 to 9999\n- The smallest value of \\(n\\) is 0, and \\(s(0) = 0 + 0 = 0\\).\n- The largest value of \\(n\\) is 9999, and the sum of its digits is \\(9 + 9 + 9 + 9 = 36\\). Therefore, \\(s(9999) = 9999 + 36 = 10035\\).\n\n### Step 3: Analyzing the increments of \\(s(n)\\)\nFor any \\(n\\), the sum of its digits is at most 36 (since the maximum digit is 9 and there are at most 4 digits). Therefore, the increment in \\(s(n)\\) when \\(n\\) increases by 1 is:\n\\[ s(n+1) - s(n) = (n+1) + \\text{(sum of digits of } n+1) - (n + \\text{sum of digits of } n) \\]\nThis simplifies to:\n\\[ s(n+1) - s(n) = 1 + (\\text{sum of digits of } n+1 - \\text{sum of digits of } n) \\]\n\nThe sum of the digits of \\(n+1\\) can be:\n- The same as the sum of the digits of \\(n\\) if \\(n\\) does not end in 9.\n- One more than the sum of the digits of \\(n\\) if \\(n\\) ends in 9.\n\nThus, the increment \\(s(n+1) - s(n)\\) can be:\n- 2 if \\(n\\) does not end in 9.\n- 1 if \\(n\\) ends in 9.\n\n### Step 4: Counting the distinct values of \\(s(n)\\)\n- The minimum value of \\(s(n)\\) is 0.\n- The maximum value of \\(s(n)\\) is 10035.\n- The increments are either 1 or 2.\n\nTo find the number of distinct values, we need to consider the sequence of \\(s(n)\\) values. Since the increments are 1 or 2, the sequence will cover all integers from 0 to 10035, but some values will be skipped.\n\n### Step 5: Determining the number of skipped values\n- The sequence starts at 0 and ends at 10035.\n- The sequence will cover all integers from 0 to 10035, but some values will be skipped due to the increments of 1 and 2.\n\nTo find the number of distinct values, we need to count the number of integers from 0 to 10035 that can be expressed as \\(s(n)\\). Since the increments are 1 or 2, the sequence will cover all integers from 0 to 10035, but some values will be skipped.\n\n### Step 6: Conclusion\nThe number of distinct values of \\(s(n)\\) for \\(n\\) from 0 to 9999 is:\n\\[ \\boxed{10035} \\]"], "id": 2896, "generated_answers": ["10035"], "gold_answer": "9046", "is_correct": false, "answers_correctness": [false]}

Let's break down the problem step by step.\n\n### Step 1: Identify the Diagonals\nA convex hexagon has 9 diagonals. These diagonals can be categorized into two types:\n- **Short diagonals**: These connect two vertices that are two positions apart (e.g., \\(A_1A_3\\), \\(A_2A_4\\), etc.).\n- **Long diagonals**: These connect two vertices that are three positions apart (e.g., \\(A_1A_4\\), \\(A_2A_5\\), etc.).\n\n### Step 2: Count the Diagonals\n- There are 6 short diagonals.\n- There are 3 long diagonals.\n\n### Step 3: Consider the Constraints\nWe need to ensure that every triangle \\(A_i A_j A_k\\) has at least one red side. This means that no triangle can have all three sides blue.\n\n### Step 4: Analyze the Long Diagonals\nFirst, consider the long diagonals.

The distance \\(d\\) between two points \\((x_1, y_1, z_1)\\) and \\((x_2, y_2, z_2)\\) in 3D space is given by:\n\\[\nd = \\sqrt{(x_2 - x_1)^2 + (y_2 - y_1)^2 + (z_2 - z_1)^2}\n\\]\n\nSubstituting the given points:\n\\[\nd = \\sqrt{(3 - 1)^2 + (3 - 2)^2 + (2 - 3)^2}\n\\]\n\\[\nd = \\sqrt{2^2 + 1^2 + (-1)^2}\n\\]\n\\[\nd = \\sqrt{4 + 1 + 1}\n\\]\n\\[\nd = \\sqrt{6}\n\\]\n\n### Step 2: Determine the side length of the cube\nThe distance \\(d\\) represents the face diagonal of the cube.

{"question": "Eight students attend a Harper Valley ARML practice. At the end of the practice, they decide to take selfies to celebrate the event. Each selfie will have either two or three students in the picture. Compute the minimum number of selfies so that each pair of the eight students appears in exactly one selfie.", "generated_responses": ["To solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum number of selfies such that each pair of the eight students appears in exactly one selfie. We will use combinatorial methods to find the solution.\n\n### Step 1: Calculate the total number of pairs of students\nFirst, we need to find the total number of pairs of students. The number of ways to choose 2 students out of 8 is given by the binomial coefficient:\n\\[\n\\binom{8}{2} = \\frac{8!}{2!(8-2)!} = \\frac{8 \\times 7}{2 \\times 1} = 28\n\\]\nSo, there are 28 pairs of students.\n\n### Step 2: Determine the number of pairs in each type of selfie\nEach selfie can have either 2 or 3 students. We need to ensure that each pair of students appears in exactly one selfie.\n\n#### Case 1: Selfies with 2 students\nIf all selfies have 2 students, then each selfie will cover exactly 1 pair of students. Therefore, to cover all 28 pairs, we would need 28 selfies.\n\n#### Case 2: Selfies with 3 students\nIf all selfies have 3 students, we need to determine how many pairs of students each selfie covers. A selfie with 3 students will cover:\n\\[\n\\binom{3}{2} = \\frac{3!}{2!(3-2)!} = \\frac{3 \\times 2}{2 \\times 1} = 3\n\\]\nSo, each 3-student selfie covers 3 pairs of students. To cover all 28 pairs, we need:\n\\[\n\\frac{28}{3} \\approx 9.33\n\\]\nSince we cannot have a fraction of a selfie, we need at least 10 selfies with 3 students. However, 10 selfies with 3 students will cover:\n\\[\n10 \\times 3 = 30 \\text{ pairs}\n\\]\nThis is more than the 28 pairs we need, so this approach is not optimal.\n\n### Step 3: Combine selfies with 2 and 3 students\nTo minimize the number of selfies, we should use a combination of selfies with 2 and 3 students. Let \\( x \\) be the number of 2-student selfies and \\( y \\) be the number of 3-student selfies. We need to satisfy the following equations:\n\\[\nx + y = \\text{total number of selfies}\n\\]\n\\[\n2x + 3y = 28\n\\]\n\nWe can solve these equations step by step. First, solve for \\( x \\) in terms of \\( y \\):\n\\[\nx = 28 - 3y\n\\]\n\nSubstitute \\( x \\) into the first equation:\n\\[\n(28 - 3y) + y = \\text{total number of selfies}\n\\]\n\\[\n28 - 2y = \\text{total number of selfies}\n\\]\n\nTo minimize the total number of selfies, we need to maximize \\( y \\). The maximum value of \\( y \\) is when \\( 28 - 3y \\geq 0 \\):\n\\[\n28 \\geq 3y\n\\]\n\\[\ny \\leq \\frac{28}{3} \\approx 9.33\n\\]\nSince \\( y \\) must be an integer, the maximum value of \\( y \\) is 9.\n\nSubstitute \\( y = 9 \\) into the equation for \\( x \\):\n\\[\nx = 28 - 3 \\times 9 = 28 - 27 = 1\n\\]\n\nThus, the minimum number of selfies is:\n\\[\nx + y = 1 + 9 = 10\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the minimum number of selfies so that each pair of the eight students appears in exactly one selfie is \\(\\boxed{10}\\)."], "id": 3010, "generated_answers": ["10"], "gold_answer": "12", "is_correct": false, "answers_correctness": [false]}

{"question": "Given a regular 16-gon, extend three of its sides to form a triangle none of whose vertices lie on the 16-gon itself. Compute the number of noncongruent triangles that can be formed in this manner.", "generated_responses": ["To solve the problem, we need to determine the number of noncongruent triangles that can be formed by extending three sides of a regular 16-gon such that none of the vertices of the triangle lie on the 16-gon itself.\n\n### Step 1: Understanding the Problem\nA regular 16-gon has 16 vertices and 16 sides. We need to extend three of these sides to form a triangle. The vertices of the triangle must not be on the 16-gon itself, meaning they must be at the points where the extensions of the sides intersect.\n\n### Step 2: Identifying the Intersection Points\nWhen we extend three sides of the 16-gon, the extensions will intersect at three points. These points form the vertices of the triangle. The key is to determine how many such triangles can be formed and how many of them are noncongruent.\n\n### Step 3: Counting the Triangles\nTo form a triangle, we need to choose 3 sides out of the 16 sides of the 16-gon. The number of ways to choose 3 sides out of 16 is given by the combination formula:\n\\[\n\\binom{16}{3} = \\frac{16 \\times 15 \\times 14}{3 \\times 2 \\times 1} = 560\n\\]\n\n### Step 4: Ensuring Noncongruence\nWe need to ensure that the triangles formed are noncongruent. Two triangles are congruent if they have the same side lengths. In a regular 16-gon, the side lengths of the triangles formed by extending the sides are determined by the number of sides of the 16-gon that are skipped.\n\n### Step 5: Analyzing the Side Lengths\nThe side lengths of the triangles are determined by the number of sides of the 16-gon that are skipped. For example, if we extend sides that are 1 side apart, the triangle will have side lengths that are 1, 1, and 14 (since 16 - 2 = 14). If we extend sides that are 2 sides apart, the triangle will have side lengths that are 2, 2, and 12 (since 16 - 4 = 12), and so on.\n\n### Step 6: Counting Noncongruent Triangles\nWe need to count the number of distinct sets of side lengths. The possible side lengths are:\n- 1, 1, 14\n- 2, 2, 12\n- 3, 3, 10\n- 4, 4, 8\n- 5, 5, 6\n\nEach of these sets of side lengths corresponds to a unique triangle. Therefore, there are 5 noncongruent triangles.\n\n### Final Answer\nThe number of noncongruent triangles that can be formed is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{5}\n\\]"], "id": 3086, "generated_answers": ["5"], "gold_answer": "11", "is_correct": false, "answers_correctness": [false]}
