Let's break down the problem step by step.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Format of the Date\nThe date is represented as an 8-digit integer in the format \\( \\text{YYYYMMDD} \\), where:\n- \\( \\text{YYYY} \\) is the 4-digit year (2023 in this case).\n- \\( \\text{MM} \\) is the 2-digit month.\n- \\( \\text{DD} \\) is the 2-digit day.\n\n### Step 2: Identify the Digits and Their Frequencies\nWe need to ensure that each digit from 0 to 9 appears an even number of times in the 8-digit display. Since the year is fixed as 2023, we only need to consider the digits in the month and day.\n\n### Step 3: Analyze the Month and Day\n- The month \\( \\text{MM} \\) ranges from 01 to 12.\n- The day \\( \\text{DD} \\) ranges from 01 to 31.\n\n### Step 4: Determine the Valid Combinations\nWe need to find combinations of \\( \\text{MM} \\) and \\( \\text{DD} \\) such that the total number of times each digit appears in the 8-digit display is even.\n\n#### Case 1: All Digits in 2023 are Even\nThe digits in 2023 are 2, 0, 2, and 3. We need to find months and days where the digits 2, 0, and 3 appear an even number of times.\n\n- The digit 2 appears twice in 2023.\n- The digit 0 appears once in 2023.\n- The digit 3 appears once in 2023.\n\nTo make the total number of times each digit appears even, we need to find months and days where the digits 0 and 3 appear an even number of times.\n\n#### Case 2: All Digits in 2023 are Odd\nThe digits in 2023 are 2, 0, 2, and 3. We need to find months and days where the digits 1, 5, 7, and 9 appear an even number of times.\n\n- The digit 1 appears zero times in 2023.\n- The digit 5 appears zero times in 2023.\n- The digit 7 appears zero times in 2023.\n- The digit 9 appears zero times in 2023.\n\nSince the digits 1, 5, 7, and 9 do not appear in 2023, this case is not possible.\n\n### Step 5: Count the Valid Combinations\nWe need to count the number of valid months and days where the digits 0 and 3 appear an even number of times.\n\n- The digit 0 appears in the month 01, 02, 03, 04, 05, 06, 07, 08, 09, 10, 11, and 12.\n- The digit 3 appears in the day 03, 13, 23, and 31.\n\nWe need to find the intersection of these sets where the total number of times each digit appears is even.\n\n### Step 6: Verify the Valid Combinations\nAfter verifying, we find that the valid combinations are:\n- 01/03, 01/13, 01/23, 01/31\n- 02/03, 02/13, 02/23, 02/31\n- 03/03, 03/13, 03/23, 03/31\n- 04/03, 04/13, 04/23, 04/31\n- 05/03, 05/13, 05/23, 05/31\n- 06/03, 06/13, 06/23, 06/31\n- 07/03, 07/13, 07/23, 07/31\n- 08/03, 08/13, 08/23, 08/31\n- 09/03, 09/13, 09/23, 09/31\n- 10/03, 10/13, 10/23, 10/31\n- 11/03, 11/13, 11/23, 11/31\n- 12/03, 12/13, 12/23, 12/31\n\n### Step 7: Count the Valid Combinations\nThere are 12 valid months and 4 valid days for each month, giving us:\n\\[ 12 \\times 4 = 48 \\]\n\nHowever, we need to ensure that the total number of times each digit appears is even. After re-evaluating, we find that the correct number of valid combinations is:\n\\[ \\boxed{48} \\]"], "id": 22, "generated_answers": ["48"], "gold_answer": "9.0", "is_correct": false, "answers_correctness": [false]}

A \\(2 \\times 1\\) rectangle can cover two adjacent squares either horizontally or vertically. There are 6 possible positions for the rectangle:\n- 3 horizontal positions: (1,1) and (1,2), (2,1) and (2,2), (3,1) and (3,2)\n- 3 vertical positions: (1,1) and (2,1), (1,2) and (2,2), (1,3) and (2,3)\n\n### Step 2: Strategy to Minimize Guesses\nTo minimize the number of turns, we need to maximize the information gained from each guess. We will use a systematic approach to cover all possible positions of the rectangle.\n\n### Step 3: First Guess\nLet's start by guessing the center square of the grid, which is (2,2). This square is part of 4 possible positions of the rectangle:\n- (1,1) and (1,2)\n- (2,1) and (2,2)\n- (1,2) and (1,3)\n- (2,1) and (2,3)\n\n### Step 4: Analyzing the Response\n- If the center square (2,2) is covered, we have found a square covered by the rectangle in one turn.\n- If the center square (2,2) is not covered, we know the rectangle must be in one of the 5 remaining positions.\n\n### Step 5: Second Guess\nIf the center square (2,2) is not covered, we need to guess another square to narrow down the possible positions. Let's guess the top-left corner square (1,1). This square is part of 2 possible positions of the rectangle:\n- (1,1) and (1,2)\n- (1,1) and (2,1)\n\n### Step 6: Analyzing the Second Response\n- If the top-left corner square (1,1) is covered, we have found a square covered by the rectangle in two turns.\n- If the top-left corner square (1,1) is not covered, we know the rectangle must be in one of the 3 remaining positions:\n  - (1,2) and (1,3)\n  - (2,1) and (2,2)\n  - (2,1) and (2,3)\n\n### Step 7: Third Guess\nIf both the center square (2,2) and the top-left corner square (1,1) are not covered, we need to guess one more square to ensure we find a covered square. Let's guess the top-right corner square (1,3). This square is part of 2 possible positions of the rectangle:\n- (1,2) and (1,3)\n- (1,3) and (2,3)\n\n### Step 8: Analyzing the Third Response\n- If the top-right corner square (1,3) is covered, we have found a square covered by the rectangle in three turns.\n- If the top-right corner square (1,3) is not covered, we know the rectangle must be in one of the 2 remaining positions:\n  - (2,1) and (2,2)\n  - (2,1) and (2,3)\n\n### Step 9: Conclusion\nIn the worst-case scenario, we will have guessed 3 squares and found that none of them are covered. However, since there are only 2 remaining possible positions for the rectangle, we are guaranteed to find a covered square in the next turn. Therefore, the minimum number of turns needed to ensure that at least one of the guessed squares is covered by the rectangle is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{3}\n\\]"], "id": 45, "generated_answers": ["3"], "gold_answer": "4.0", "is_correct": false, "answers_correctness": [false]}
