{"question": "If $f(x)$ is a polynomial of degree 7, and $g(x)$ is a polynomial of degree 7, then what is the product of the minimum and the maximum possible degrees of $f(x) + g(x)$?", "generated_responses": ["To determine the product of the minimum and maximum possible degrees of \\( f(x) + g(x) \\) where \\( f(x) \\) and \\( g(x) \\) are both polynomials of degree 7, we need to analyze the behavior of the sum of these polynomials.\n\n### Step 1: Maximum Possible Degree of \\( f(x) + g(x) \\)\nThe maximum possible degree of \\( f(x) + g(x) \\) occurs when the leading coefficients of \\( f(x) \\) and \\( g(x) \\) do not cancel each other out. Since both \\( f(x) \\) and \\( g(x) \\) are polynomials of degree 7, the highest degree term in \\( f(x) + g(x) \\) will be the sum of the leading terms of \\( f(x) \\) and \\( g(x) \\).\n\nThus, the maximum possible degree of \\( f(x) + g(x) \\) is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{7}\n\\]\n\n### Step 2: Minimum Possible Degree of \\( f(x) + g(x) \\)\nThe minimum possible degree of \\( f(x) + g(x) \\) occurs when the leading coefficients of \\( f(x) \\) and \\( g(x) \\) are exactly opposite in sign and equal in magnitude, causing the leading terms to cancel each other out. In this case, the degree of \\( f(x) + g(x) \\) will be less than 7.\n\nThe minimum possible degree of \\( f(x) + g(x) \\) can be 0, which occurs if \\( f(x) \\) and \\( g(x) \\) are exact negatives of each other. For example, if \\( f(x) = x^7 + x^6 + \\cdots + x + 1 \\) and \\( g(x) = -x^7 - x^6 - \\cdots - x - 1 \\), then:\n\\[\nf(x) + g(x) = (x^7 + x^6 + \\cdots + x + 1) + (-x^7 - x^6 - \\cdots - x - 1) = 0\n\\]\nwhich is a polynomial of degree 0.\n\nThus, the minimum possible degree of \\( f(x) + g(x) \\) is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{0}\n\\]\n\n### Step 3: Product of the Minimum and Maximum Possible Degrees\nNow, we need to find the product of the minimum and maximum possible degrees of \\( f(x) + g(x) \\):\n\\[\n7 \\times 0 = 0\n\\]\n\nThus, the product of the minimum and maximum possible degrees of \\( f(x) + g(x) \\) is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{0}\n\\]"], "id": "1", "generated_answers": ["0"], "gold_answer": "0", "is_correct": true, "answers_correctness": [true]}
