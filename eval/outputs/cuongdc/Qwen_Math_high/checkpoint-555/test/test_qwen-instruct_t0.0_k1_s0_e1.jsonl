{"question": "If $f(x)$ is a polynomial of degree 7, and $g(x)$ is a polynomial of degree 7, then what is the product of the minimum and the maximum possible degrees of $f(x) + g(x)$?", "generated_responses": ["To determine the product of the minimum and the maximum possible degrees of \\( f(x) + g(x) \\) where \\( f(x) \\) and \\( g(x) \\) are polynomials of degree 7, we need to analyze the behavior of the sum of these polynomials.\n\n### Step 1: Understanding the Degrees of Polynomials\n- \\( f(x) \\) is a polynomial of degree 7.\n- \\( g(x) \\) is a polynomial of degree 7.\n\n### Step 2: Sum of Polynomials\nThe sum of two polynomials \\( f(x) \\) and \\( g(x) \\) is given by:\n\\[ f(x) + g(x) \\]\n\n### Step 3: Maximum Degree of \\( f(x) + g(x) \\)\n- The maximum degree of \\( f(x) + g(x) \\) occurs when the leading terms of \\( f(x) \\) and \\( g(x) \\) do not cancel each other out.\n- The leading term of \\( f(x) \\) is \\( a_7 x^7 \\).\n- The leading term of \\( g(x) \\) is \\( b_7 x^7 \\).\n- The leading term of \\( f(x) + g(x) \\) is \\( (a_7 + b_7) x^7 \\).\n\nFor the leading term to be non-zero, \\( a_7 + b_7 \\neq 0 \\). Therefore, the maximum degree of \\( f(x) + g(x) \\) is 7.\n\n### Step 4: Minimum Degree of \\( f(x) + g(x) \\)\n- The minimum degree of \\( f(x) + g(x) \\) occurs when the leading terms of \\( f(x) \\) and \\( g(x) \\) cancel each other out.\n- If \\( a_7 + b_7 = 0 \\), the leading term \\( (a_7 + b_7) x^7 \\) becomes zero, and the next highest degree term in \\( f(x) \\) and \\( g(x) \\) will determine the degree of \\( f(x) + g(x) \\).\n\nSince \\( f(x) \\) and \\( g(x) \\) are both of degree 7, the next highest degree term is \\( x^6 \\). Therefore, the minimum degree of \\( f(x) + g(x) \\) is 6.\n\n### Step 5: Product of the Minimum and Maximum Degrees\n- The maximum degree of \\( f(x) + g(x) \\) is 7.\n- The minimum degree of \\( f(x) + g(x) \\) is 6.\n\nThe product of the minimum and maximum degrees is:\n\\[ 7 \\times 6 = 42 \\]\n\nThus, the final answer is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{42}\n\\]"], "id": "1", "generated_answers": ["42"], "gold_answer": "0", "is_correct": false, "answers_correctness": [false]}
