The key is to find the smallest number of such polynomials.\n\n### Step 2: Initial Consideration\nFirst, let's consider if \\( x^2 + 7 \\) can be expressed as a single square of a polynomial.

Find the maximum possible number of isosceles triangles with two odd sides.", "generated_responses": ["To solve the problem, we need to understand the properties of the 2006-gon and the conditions for a triangle to be isosceles with two odd sides.\n\n### Step 1: Understanding the 2006-gon\nA 2006-gon has 2006 vertices. A diagonal is a line segment connecting two non-adjacent vertices. A diagonal is called odd if its endpoints divide the boundary into two parts, each composed of an odd number of sides. Sides are also considered odd diagonals.\n\n### Step 2: Dissecting the 2006-gon into triangles\nThe 2006-gon can be dissected into 2004 triangles using 2003 nonintersecting diagonals. Each triangle has three sides, and we are interested in the number of isosceles triangles with two odd sides.\n\n### Step 3: Properties of isosceles triangles with two odd sides\nFor a triangle to be isosceles with two odd sides, the third side must be even. This is because the sum of the lengths of the sides of a triangle must be even (since the perimeter of a triangle is the sum of its sides).\n\n### Step 4: Counting the number of odd and even sides\nIn a 2006-gon, the number of odd sides is 1003 (since 2006 is even, half of the sides are odd). The number of even sides is also 1003.\n\n### Step 5: Forming isosceles triangles with two odd sides\nTo form an isosceles triangle with two odd sides, we need to choose two odd sides and one even side. The number of ways to choose two odd sides from 1003 odd sides is given by the binomial coefficient:\n\\[\n\\binom{1003}{2} = \\frac{1003 \\times 1002}{2} = 503503\n\\]\n\n### Step 6: Ensuring the triangles are non-overlapping\nHowever, we need to ensure that these triangles do not overlap. Since the 2006-gon is dissected into 2004 triangles, we need to find the maximum number of non-overlapping isosceles triangles with two odd sides.\n\n### Step 7: Maximum number of non-overlapping isosceles triangles\nTo maximize the number of non-overlapping isosceles triangles with two odd sides, we need to consider the structure of the 2006-gon and the constraints of the dissection. The maximum number of such triangles is given by the number of ways to choose 2002 odd sides from 1003 odd sides, which is:\n\\[\n\\binom{1003}{2} = 503503\n\\]\n\nHowever, since the 2006-gon is dissected into 2004 triangles, the maximum number of non-overlapping isosceles triangles with two odd sides is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{1002}\n\\]"], "id": 1750, "generated_answers": ["1002"], "gold_answer": "$1003$", "is_correct": false, "answers_correctness": [false]}

This ensures that no colour is missing in any group of \\( n+1 \\) consecutive marbles.\n\n### Step 4: Proving the Sufficient Condition\nTo prove that \\( m \\geq 2n \\) is sufficient, consider the following:\n- If \\( m = 2n \\), we can place \\( n \\) marbles of each colour \\( C_1, C_2, \\ldots, C_n \\) around the circle.\n- In any group of \\( n+1 \\) consecutive marbles, there will be at least one marble of each colour because there are \\( n \\) marbles of each colour and \\( n+1 \\) marbles in the group.\n\n### Step 5: Proving the Necessity\nTo prove that \\( m < 2n \\) is not sufficient, consider the following:\n- If \\( m < 2n \\), there are fewer than \\( 2n \\) marbles in total.\n- In any group of \\( n+1 \\) consecutive marbles, if \\( m < 2n \\), it is possible that one or more colours are missing in some groups of \\( n+1 \\) consecutive marbles.\n\n### Step 6: Conclusion\nFrom the above steps, we conclude that \\( m \\geq 2n \\) is the smallest integer that is \\( n \\)-colourful. Therefore, the largest integer that is not \\( n \\)-colourful is \\( 2n - 1 \\).\n\n### Final Answer\n\\[\n\\boxed{2n-1}\n\\]"], "id": 1782, "generated_answers": ["2n-1"], "gold_answer": "$m_{\\max }=n^{2}-n-1$", "is_correct": false, "answers_correctness": [false]}

This means that no two rows can be too similar in terms of their column values.\n\n### Step 3: Using the Pigeonhole Principle\nConsider the possible values in each column. Each column can contain any of the numbers from 1 to 100. However, to ensure that the difference condition is met, we need to distribute the numbers in such a way that no two rows are too close in any column.\n\n### Step 4: Constructing a Valid Table\nWe can construct a table where each row is a permutation of the numbers 1 through 100, and we ensure that for any two rows, there is at least one column where the difference is at least 2.\n\n### Step 5: Counting the Rows\nTo find the maximum number of rows \\( N \\), we need to consider the constraints and the distribution of numbers. We can use the fact that each row is a permutation of 100 numbers, and we need to ensure that for any two rows, there is at least one column where the difference is at least 2.\n\n### Step 6: Using the Erdős–Szekeres Theorem\nThe Erdős–Szekeres theorem states that in any sequence of \\( n^2 + 1 \\) distinct real numbers, there is either an increasing subsequence of length \\( n+1 \\) or a decreasing subsequence of length \\( n+1 \\). In our case, we can use this theorem to show that the maximum number of rows \\( N \\) is 50.\n\n### Step 7: Conclusion\nBy carefully constructing the table and using the Erdős–Szekeres theorem, we can show that the maximum number of rows \\( N \\) for which there exists a table \\( T \\) that satisfies the given properties is 50.\n\nThus, the largest \\( N \\) is \\(\\boxed{50}\\)."], "id": 1789, "generated_answers": ["50"], "gold_answer": "$\\frac{100!}{2^{50}}$", "is_correct": false, "answers_correctness": [false]}

There are \\( \\binom{5}{2} = 10 \\) such ratios. We need to find a way to ensure that among these 10 ratios, there exist four distinct indices \\( i, j, k, l \\) such that the absolute difference between the ratios \\( \\frac{a_i}{a_j} \\) and \\( \\frac{a_k}{a_l} \\) is at most \\( C \\).\n\n### Step 3: Using the Pigeonhole Principle\nWe will use the pigeonhole principle to find a bound on \\( C \\). Consider the ratios \\( \\frac{a_i}{a_j} \\) and their logarithms \\( \\log \\left( \\frac{a_i}{a_j} \\right) \\).

The worst-case scenario occurs when the differences \\( d_{ij} \\) are as spread out as possible. The maximum spread of 10 differences is from the smallest to the largest, which is 4 units (since there are 5 numbers and 10 differences).\n\n### Step 7: Verifying the Bound\nWe need to verify that \\( C = 1 \\) is the smallest possible value.

{"question": "We are given an infinite deck of cards, each with a real number on it. For every real number $x$, there is exactly one card in the deck that has $x$ written on it. Now two players draw disjoint sets $A$ and $B$ of 100 cards each from this deck. We would like to define a rule that declares one of them a winner. This rule should satisfy the following conditions:\n\n1. The winner only depends on the relative order of the 200 cards: if the cards are laid down in increasing order face down and we are told which card belongs to which player, but not what numbers are written on them, we can still decide the winner.\n2.

Here, we consider two rules as different if there exist two sets $A$ and $B$ such that $A$ beats $B$ according to one rule, but $B$ beats $A$ according to the other.", "generated_responses": ["To solve this problem, we need to define a rule that satisfies the given conditions. Let's break down the problem step by step.\n\n### Step 1: Understanding the Problem\nWe have an infinite deck of cards, each with a unique real number. Two players draw disjoint sets \\( A \\) and \\( B \\) of 100 cards each. We need to define a rule to determine the winner based on the relative order of the 200 cards.\n\n### Step 2: Conditions to Satisfy\n1. The winner depends only on the relative order of the 200 cards.\n2. If \\( a_i > b_i \\) for all \\( i \\), then \\( A \\) beats \\( B \\).\n3. If \\( A \\) beats \\( B \\) and \\( B \\) beats \\( C \\), then \\( A \\) beats \\( C \\).\n\n### Step 3: Analyzing the Problem\nTo satisfy these conditions, we need to consider the relative order of the 200 cards. We can represent the 200 cards as a sequence of 200 distinct real numbers. The key is to determine a rule that compares the two sets \\( A \\) and \\( B \\) based on this sequence.\n\n### Step 4: Defining the Rule\nOne way to define the rule is to use the concept of the \"majority\" of the cards. Specifically, we can define the rule as follows:\n- \\( A \\) beats \\( B \\) if the number of cards in \\( A \\) that are greater than the corresponding cards in \\( B \\) is more than 50.\n\n### Step 5: Verifying the Rule\n1. **Dependence on Relative Order**: The rule depends only on the relative order of the 200 cards, satisfying the first condition.\n2. **If \\( a_i > b_i \\) for all \\( i \\)**: In this case, all 100 cards in \\( A \\) are greater than the corresponding cards in \\( B \\), so \\( A \\) beats \\( B \\), satisfying the second condition.\n3. **Transitivity**: If \\( A \\) beats \\( B \\) and \\( B \\) beats \\( C \\), then the number of cards in \\( A \\) that are greater than the corresponding cards in \\( B \\) is more than 50, and the number of cards in \\( B \\) that are greater than the corresponding cards in \\( C \\) is more than 50. This implies that the number of cards in \\( A \\) that are greater than the corresponding cards in \\( C \\) is more than 50, so \\( A \\) beats \\( C \\), satisfying the third condition.\n\n### Step 6: Counting the Number of Ways to Define the Rule\nThe rule we defined is based on the concept of the \"majority\" of the cards. There are two possible ways to define the rule:\n1. \\( A \\) beats \\( B \\) if the number of cards in \\( A \\) that are greater than the corresponding cards in \\( B \\) is more than 50.\n2. \\( B \\) beats \\( A \\) if the number of cards in \\( B \\) that are greater than the corresponding cards in \\( A \\) is more than 50.\n\nThese two rules are essentially the same but in reverse order. Therefore, there are exactly 2 ways to define such a rule.\n\n### Final Answer\n\\[\n\\boxed{2}\n\\]"], "id": 1977, "generated_answers": ["2"], "gold_answer": "100", "is_correct": false, "answers_correctness": [false]}

Since each block of 3 elements can contribute a sum of at least \\(-3\\) or at most \\(3\\), we need to find a way to ensure that the sum of the chosen elements is at least \\( C \\).\n\n### Step 6: Using the Pigeonhole Principle\nBy the pigeonhole principle, in any sequence of 2022 elements, there must be a subsequence of 674 elements (since \\( 2022 / 3 = 674 \\)) that are either all +1 or all -1. This is because if we divide the sequence into 674 blocks of 3 elements, at least one of these blocks must have a sum of at least 3 or at most -3.\n\n### Step 7: Ensuring the Sum is at Least 333\nTo ensure that the sum of the chosen elements is at least 333, we can use the fact that in any sequence of 2022 elements, there must be a subsequence of 674 elements that are either all +1 or all -1. If we choose 333 elements from this subsequence, the sum will be at least 333.\n\n### Step 8: Conclusion\nThus, the largest \\( C \\) such that for any \\(\\pm 1\\)-sequence of 2022 numbers, there exists a subsequence where the indices are at most 2 apart, and the sum of the elements in this subsequence is at least \\( C \\) in absolute value is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{333}\n\\]"], "id": 2004, "generated_answers": ["333"], "gold_answer": "506", "is_correct": false, "answers_correctness": [false]}

One way to achieve this is to use a grid of points and ensure that the distances between points are such that the area condition is met.\n\n### Step 4: Using a Grid\nConsider a grid of points where the coordinates are multiples of a certain integer. For example, if we choose points with coordinates \\((x, y)\\) where \\( x \\) and \\( y \\) are multiples of 2, the area of any triangle formed by these points will be an integer multiple of 2.\n\n### Step 5: Ensuring the Area Condition\nTo ensure the area is exactly \\( k \\), we need to choose \\( k \\) such that the grid points can form triangles with the required area. The smallest \\( k \\) that can be formed by such a grid is 2. However, we need to check if a larger \\( k \\) can form a larger clique.\n\n### Step 6: Verifying Larger \\( k \\)\nWe need to find the smallest \\( k \\) such that a \\( k \\)-clique with more than 200 elements exists.

{"question": "In each town in ARMLandia, the residents have formed groups, which meet each week to share math problems and enjoy each others' company over a potluck-style dinner. Each town resident belongs to exactly one group. Every week, each resident is required to make one dish and to bring it to his/her group.\n\nIt so happens that each resident knows how to make precisely two dishes. Moreover, no two residents of a town know how to make the same pair of dishes. Shown below are two example towns. In the left column are the names of the town's residents. Adjacent to each name is the list of dishes that the corresponding resident knows how to make.\n\n| ARMLton |  |\n| :--- | :--- |\n| Resident | Dishes |\n| Paul | pie, turkey |\n| Arnold | pie, salad |\n| Kelly | salad, broth |\n\n\n| ARMLville |  |\n| :--- | :--- |\n| Resident | Dishes |\n| Sally | steak, calzones |\n| Ross | calzones, pancakes |\n| David | steak, pancakes |\n\nThe population of a town $T$, denoted $\\operatorname{pop}(T)$, is the number of residents of $T$. Formally, the town itself is simply the set of its residents, denoted by $\\left\\{r_{1}, \\ldots, r_{\\mathrm{pop}(T)}\\right\\}$ unless otherwise specified. The set of dishes that the residents of $T$ collectively know how to make is denoted $\\operatorname{dish}(T)$. For example, in the town of ARMLton described above, pop(ARMLton) $=3$, and dish(ARMLton) $=$ \\{pie, turkey, salad, broth\\}.\n\nA town $T$ is called full if for every pair of dishes in $\\operatorname{dish}(T)$, there is exactly one resident in $T$ who knows how to make those two dishes. In the examples above, ARMLville is a full town, but ARMLton is not, because (for example) nobody in ARMLton knows how to make both turkey and salad.\n\nDenote by $\\mathcal{F}_{d}$ a full town in which collectively the residents know how to make $d$ dishes. That is, $\\left|\\operatorname{dish}\\left(\\mathcal{F}_{d}\\right)\\right|=d$.\n\nIn order to avoid the embarrassing situation where two people bring the same dish to a group dinner, if two people know how to make a common dish, they are forbidden from participating in the same group meeting. Formally, a group assignment on $T$ is a function $f: T \\rightarrow\\{1,2, \\ldots, k\\}$, satisfying the condition that if $f\\left(r_{i}\\right)=f\\left(r_{j}\\right)$ for $i \\neq j$, then $r_{i}$ and $r_{j}$ do not know any of the same recipes. The group number of a town $T$, denoted $\\operatorname{gr}(T)$, is the least positive integer $k$ for which there exists a group assignment on $T$.\n\nFor example, consider once again the town of ARMLton. A valid group assignment would be $f($ Paul $)=f($ Kelly $)=1$ and $f($ Arnold $)=2$. The function which gives the value 1 to each resident of ARMLton is not a group assignment, because Paul and Arnold must be assigned to different groups.\n\n\nFor a dish $D$, a resident is called a $D$-chef if he or she knows how to make the dish $D$. Define $\\operatorname{chef}_{T}(D)$ to be the set of residents in $T$ who are $D$-chefs. For example, in ARMLville, David is a steak-chef and a pancakes-chef. Further, $\\operatorname{chef}_{\\text {ARMLville }}($ steak $)=\\{$ Sally, David $\\}$.\n\n\nIf $\\operatorname{gr}(T)=\\left|\\operatorname{chef}_{T}(D)\\right|$ for some $D \\in \\operatorname{dish}(T)$, then $T$ is called homogeneous. If $\\operatorname{gr}(T)>\\left|\\operatorname{chef}_{T}(D)\\right|$ for each dish $D \\in \\operatorname{dish}(T)$, then $T$ is called heterogeneous. For example, ARMLton is homogeneous, because $\\operatorname{gr}($ ARMLton $)=2$ and exactly two chefs make pie, but ARMLville is heterogeneous, because even though each dish is only cooked by two chefs, $\\operatorname{gr}($ ARMLville $)=3$.\n\n\nA resident cycle is a sequence of distinct residents $r_{1}, \\ldots, r_{n}$ such that for each $1 \\leq i \\leq n-1$, the residents $r_{i}$ and $r_{i+1}$ know how to make a common dish, residents $r_{n}$ and $r_{1}$ know how to make a common dish, and no other pair of residents $r_{i}$ and $r_{j}, 1 \\leq i, j \\leq n$ know how to make a common dish. Two resident cycles are indistinguishable if they contain the same residents (in any order), and distinguishable otherwise. For example, if $r_{1}, r_{2}, r_{3}, r_{4}$ is a resident cycle, then $r_{2}, r_{1}, r_{4}, r_{3}$ and $r_{3}, r_{2}, r_{1}, r_{4}$ are indistinguishable resident cycles.\nIn terms of $k$ and $d$, find the number of distinguishable resident cycles of length $k$ in $\\mathcal{F}_{d}$.", "generated_responses": ["To solve the problem, we need to determine the number of distinguishable resident cycles of length \\( k \\) in a full town \\(\\mathcal{F}_d\\) where \\( d \\) is the number of dishes and \\( k \\) is the number of residents in the cycle.\n\n### Step-by-Step Solution:\n\n1. **Understanding the Problem:**\n   - A full town \\(\\mathcal{F}_d\\) has \\( d \\) dishes and each pair of dishes is known by exactly one resident.\n   - A resident cycle of length \\( k \\) is a sequence of \\( k \\) distinct residents such that each pair of consecutive residents in the cycle knows a common dish, and no other pair of residents in the cycle knows a common dish.\n\n2. **Counting the Number of Resident Cycles:**\n   - We need to count the number of distinguishable resident cycles of length \\( k \\) in \\(\\mathcal{F}_d\\).\n\n3. **Choosing \\( k \\) Dishes:**\n   - First, we choose \\( k \\) dishes from the \\( d \\) available dishes.

Therefore, the \\( k \\) chosen dishes will form \\( k \\) pairs of residents.\n\n5. **Arranging the Pairs:**\n   - We need to arrange these \\( k \\) pairs in a cycle. The number of ways to arrange \\( k \\) pairs in a cycle is given by \\((k-1)!\\). This is because the first pair can be fixed to break the symmetry, and the remaining \\( k-1 \\) pairs can be arranged in \\((k-1)!\\) ways.\n\n6. **Combining the Steps:**\n   - The total number of distinguishable resident cycles of length \\( k \\) is the product of the number of ways to choose \\( k \\) dishes and the number of ways to arrange the pairs in a cycle:\n     \\[\n     \\binom{d}{k} \\cdot (k-1)!\n     \\]\n\n7. **Simplifying the Expression:**\n   - The binomial coefficient \\(\\binom{d}{k}\\) is given by:\n     \\[\n     \\binom{d}{k} = \\frac{d!}{k!(d-k)!}\n     \\]\n   - Therefore, the total number of distinguishable resident cycles of length \\( k \\) is:\n     \\[\n     \\frac{d!}{k!(d-k)!} \\cdot (k-1)!\n     \\]\n   - Simplifying this expression, we get:\n     \\[\n     \\frac{d!}{k!(d-k)!} \\cdot (k-1)! = \\frac{d!}{k \\cdot (d-k)!}\n     \\]\n\n8. **Final Answer:**\n   - The number of distinguishable resident cycles of length \\( k \\) in \\(\\mathcal{F}_d\\) is:\n     \\[\n     \\boxed{\\frac{d!}{k \\cdot (d-k)!}}\n     \\]"], "id": 2626, "generated_answers": ["\\frac{d!}{k \\cdot (d-k)!}"], "gold_answer": "$\\frac{d !}{2 k(d-k) !}$", "is_correct": false, "answers_correctness": [false]}

A permutation of a finite set is a bijection, meaning every element in \\( S \\) is mapped to exactly one other element in \\( S \\).\n\n### Step 3: Periodic Behavior of \\( f \\)\nA permutation of a finite set is always periodic.

We can choose any 3 distinct digits from the set \\(\\{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9\\}\\) (since the first digit cannot be 0).

We can choose any 3 distinct digits from the set \\(\\{0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9\\}\\).

Given \\( T = T N Y W R \\), we interpret \\( T \\) as a placeholder for a number. For the sake of this problem, let's assume \\( T = 5 \\) (since \\( T N Y W R \\) could be a sequence of 5 letters). Therefore, \\( T + 1 = 6 \\) colors are available.\n\n2. **Define the problem constraints:**\n   - Use at least three colors.\n   - No two consecutive fingernails can have the same color.\n\n3. **Calculate the number of ways to paint the fingernails:**\n   We will use the principle of inclusion-exclusion to count the valid colorings.\n\n   - **Total number of colorings without any restrictions:**\n     Each fingernail can be painted in any of the 6 colors. Therefore, the total number of colorings is:\n     \\[\n     6^5\n     \\]\n\n   - **Subtract the number of colorings using fewer than 3 colors:**\n     - **Using 1 color:**\n       There are 6 ways to choose 1 color, and each fingernail must be painted with that color. This is not possible since no two consecutive fingernails can have the same color.\n       \\[\n       0\n       \\]\n     - **Using 2 colors:**\n       Choose 2 colors out of 6, which can be done in \\(\\binom{6}{2} = 15\\) ways. For each pair of colors, we need to count the number of valid colorings of 5 fingernails using these 2 colors such that no two consecutive fingernails have the same color. This is a classic problem of counting valid sequences of length 5 using 2 colors where no two consecutive elements are the same. The number of such sequences is given by the recurrence relation:\n       \\[\n       a_n = 2a_{n-1} + 2a_{n-2}\n       \\]\n       with initial conditions \\( a_1 = 2 \\) and \\( a_2 = 2 \\). Solving this, we get:\n       \\[\n       a_3 = 2a_2 + 2a_1 = 2 \\cdot 2 + 2 \\cdot 2 = 8\n       \\]\n       \\[\n       a_4 = 2a_3 + 2a_2 = 2 \\cdot 8 + 2 \\cdot 2 = 20\n       \\]\n       \\[\n       a_5 = 2a_4 + 2a_3 = 2 \\cdot 20 + 2 \\cdot 8 = 56\n       \\]\n       Therefore, the number of valid colorings using 2 colors is:\n       \\[\n       15 \\cdot 56 = 840\n       \\]\n\n   - **Apply the principle of inclusion-exclusion:**\n     The number of valid colorings using at least 3 colors is:\n     \\[\n     6^5 - 840\n     \\]\n\n4. **Calculate the final result:**\n   \\[\n   6^5 = 7776\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   7776 - 840 = 6936\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, the number of ways Kay can paint the five fingernails on her left hand by using at least three colors and such that no two consecutive fingernails have the same color is \\(\\boxed{6936}\\)."], "id": 2857, "generated_answers": ["6936"], "gold_answer": "109890", "is_correct": false, "answers_correctness": [false]}

There are 9 diagonals in total.\n\n2. **Count the triangles:**\n   - The hexagon can be divided into 20 triangles by drawing all the diagonals from one vertex. However, we are interested in the triangles formed by any three vertices of the hexagon.\n   - There are \\(\\binom{6}{3} = 20\\) triangles in total.\n\n3. **Coloring constraints:**\n   - Each triangle must have at least one red side.\n   - We need to ensure that no triangle is completely blue.\n\n4. **Use the principle of inclusion-exclusion:**\n   - Let \\( S \\) be the set of all possible colorings of the diagonals.\n   - Let \\( A_i \\) be the set of colorings where the \\( i \\)-th triangle is completely blue.\n   - We need to find \\( |S - (A_1 \\cup A_2 \\cup \\cdots \\cup A_{20})| \\).\n\n5. **Calculate the size of \\( S \\):**\n   - Each of the 9 diagonals can be either red or blue.\n   - Therefore, \\( |S| = 2^9 = 512 \\).\n\n6. **Calculate the size of \\( A_i \\):**\n   - If a triangle is completely blue, the 3 diagonals forming that triangle must be blue.\n   - The remaining 6 diagonals can be either red or blue.\n   - Therefore, \\( |A_i| = 2^6 = 64 \\).\n\n7. **Calculate the size of \\( A_i \\cap A_j \\):**\n   - If two triangles share a common diagonal, that diagonal must be blue.\n   - The remaining 5 diagonals can be either red or blue.\n   - Therefore, \\( |A_i \\cap A_j| = 2^5 = 32 \\).\n\n8. **Calculate the size of \\( A_i \\cap A_j \\cap A_k \\):**\n   - If three triangles share a common diagonal, that diagonal must be blue.\n   - The remaining 4 diagonals can be either red or blue.\n   - Therefore, \\( |A_i \\cap A_j \\cap A_k| = 2^4 = 16 \\).\n\n9. **Apply the principle of inclusion-exclusion:**\n   \\[\n   |S - (A_1 \\cup A_2 \\cup \\cdots \\cup A_{20})| = 512 - \\sum_{i=1}^{20} |A_i| + \\sum_{1 \\leq i < j \\leq 20} |A_i \\cap A_j| - \\sum_{1 \\leq i < j < k \\leq 20} |A_i \\cap A_j \\cap A_k|\n   \\]\n\n10. **Simplify the expression:**\n    - The number of ways to choose 1 triangle to be completely blue is \\(\\binom{20}{1} = 20\\).\n    - The number of ways to choose 2 triangles to be completely blue is \\(\\binom{20}{2} = 190\\).\n    - The number of ways to choose 3 triangles to be completely blue is \\(\\binom{20}{3} = 1140\\).\n\n    \\[\n    |S - (A_1 \\cup A_2 \\cup \\cdots \\cup A_{20})| = 512 - 20 \\cdot 64 + 190 \\cdot 32 - 1140 \\cdot 16\n    \\]\n\n11. **Calculate the final result:**\n    \\[\n    512 - 1280 + 6080 - 18240 = 512 - 1280 + 6080 - 18240 = 1024\n    \\]\n\nTherefore, the number of colorings such that every triangle \\( A_i A_j A_k \\) has at least one red side is \\(\\boxed{1024}\\)."], "id": 2953, "generated_answers": ["1024"], "gold_answer": "392", "is_correct": false, "answers_correctness": [false]}
