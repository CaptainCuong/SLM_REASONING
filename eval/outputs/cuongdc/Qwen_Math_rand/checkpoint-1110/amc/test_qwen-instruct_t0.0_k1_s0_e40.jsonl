The gcd of 6, 10, and 15 is 1, so any integer can be expressed as a combination of these coins if we can find a way to express 1.\n\n### Step 3: Using the Chicken McNugget Theorem\nThe Chicken McNugget theorem (or Frobenius coin problem) states that for two coprime integers \\( m \\) and \\( n \\), the largest number that cannot be expressed as \\( am + bn \\) for non-negative integers \\( a \\) and \\( b \\) is \\( mn - m - n \\).\n\nHowever, we have three coins, and the theorem does not directly apply. Instead, we need to find the largest number that cannot be expressed using 6, 10, and 15.\n\n### Step 4: Finding the Largest Non-Expressible Value\nWe will use a systematic approach to find the largest value that cannot be expressed.

This can be broken down into two cases:\n1. \\( | x | - 1 \\ge 0 \\) which implies \\( | x | \\ge 1 \\)\n2. \\( | x | - 1 < 0 \\) which implies \\( | x | < 1 \\)\n\nSimilarly, for \\( | | y | - 1 | \\), we have:\n1. \\( | y | - 1 \\ge 0 \\) which implies \\( | y | \\ge 1 \\)\n2. \\( | y | - 1 < 0 \\) which implies \\( | y | < 1 \\)\n\n### Step 2: Consider the Four Quadrants\nWe need to consider the four quadrants of the coordinate plane:\n1. \\( x \\ge 0 \\) and \\( y \\ge 0 \\)\n2. \\( x \\ge 0 \\) and \\( y \\le 0 \\)\n3. \\( x \\le 0 \\) and \\( y \\ge 0 \\)\n4. \\( x \\le 0 \\) and \\( y \\le 0 \\)\n\n### Step 3: Analyze Each Quadrant\n#### Quadrant 1: \\( x \\ge 0 \\) and \\( y \\ge 0 \\)\nIn this quadrant, \\( | x | = x \\) and \\( | y | = y \\).
