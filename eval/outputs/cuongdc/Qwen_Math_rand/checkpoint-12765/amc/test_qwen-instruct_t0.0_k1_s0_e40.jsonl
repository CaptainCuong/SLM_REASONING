However, we can simplify the problem by considering the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the coin values. The GCD of 6, 10, and 15 is 1, which means any integer value can be expressed as a linear combination of these coins if we allow negative coefficients. However, we are interested in non-negative combinations.\n\n### Step 3: Using the Chicken McNugget Theorem\nThe Chicken McNugget theorem (or Frobenius coin problem) for two coin denominations \\( a \\) and \\( b \\) states that the largest value that cannot be expressed as \\( ax + by \\) is \\( ab - a - b \\).
