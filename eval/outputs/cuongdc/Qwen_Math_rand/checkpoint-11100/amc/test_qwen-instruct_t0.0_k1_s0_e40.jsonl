This problem is a classic example of the Frobenius coin problem, which involves finding the largest value that cannot be expressed as a non-negative integer combination of given coin values.\n\n### Step 1: Understanding the Problem\nWe are given coin values \\(6\\), \\(10\\), and \\(15\\) cents. We need to find the largest value \\(x\\) that cannot be expressed as:\n\\[ 6a + 10b + 15c \\]\nwhere \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are non-negative integers.\n\n### Step 2: Simplifying the Problem\nFirst, observe that \\(15\\) is a multiple of \\(5\\), and both \\(6\\) and \\(10\\) are also multiples of \\(2\\). Therefore, any combination of these coins will be a multiple of the greatest common divisor (GCD) of \\(6\\), \\(10\\), and \\(15\\). The GCD of \\(6\\), \\(10\\), and \\(15\\) is \\(1\\), so any integer value can be expressed using these coins if we can find a way to express \\(1\\) as a combination of \\(6\\), \\(10\\), and \\(15\\).\n\n### Step 3: Expressing 1 as a Combination\nWe need to find integers \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) such that:\n\\[ 6a + 10b + 15c = 1 \\]\n\nHowever, it is not possible to express \\(1\\) as a combination of \\(6\\), \\(10\\), and \\(15\\) using non-negative integers. This is because the smallest positive value that can be expressed is \\(2\\) (as \\(2 = 10 - 6\\)).\n\n### Step 4: Finding the Frobenius Number\nSince we cannot express \\(1\\) as a combination of \\(6\\), \\(10\\), and \\(15\\), we need to find the largest value that cannot be expressed as a combination of these coins. This is known as the Frobenius number for the set \\(\\{6, 10, 15\\}\\).\n\n### Step 5: Using the Frobenius Number Formula\nFor three coin values \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\), the Frobenius number \\(g(a, b, c)\\) can be found using the formula:\n\\[ g(a, b, c) = ab - a - b \\]\nHowever, this formula is only valid for two coin values. For three coin values, we need to use a more general approach.\n\n### Step 6: General Approach for Three Coin Values\nWe can use the fact that the Frobenius number for three coin values \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) is the largest value that cannot be expressed as a combination of these coins.
