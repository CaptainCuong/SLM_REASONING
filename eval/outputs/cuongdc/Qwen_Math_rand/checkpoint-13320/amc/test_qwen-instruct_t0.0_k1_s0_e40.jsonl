We will use a combinatorial approach to count the number of favorable outcomes and the total number of possible outcomes.\n\n### Step 1: Total Number of Outcomes\nEach roll of the die has 6 possible outcomes. Since Janet rolls the die 4 times, the total number of possible outcomes is:\n\\[\n6^4 = 1296\n\\]\n\n### Step 2: Favorable Outcomes\nWe need to count the number of sequences of 4 rolls where the running total equals 3 at some point. We will consider the possible sequences and their sums.\n\n#### Case 1: Running Total Equals 3 After the First Roll\nThe only way this can happen is if the first roll is a 3. The remaining three rolls can be any number from 1 to 6. Thus, there are:\n\\[\n1 \\times 6^3 = 216\n\\]\nsequences where the running total equals 3 after the first roll.\n\n#### Case 2: Running Total Equals 3 After the Second Roll\nFor the running total to equal 3 after the second roll, the sum of the first two rolls must be 3. The possible pairs of rolls are:\n- (1, 2)\n- (2, 1)\n- (3, 0) (not possible since the minimum roll is 1)\n\nThus, there are 2 valid pairs. For each pair, the remaining two rolls can be any number from 1 to 6. Therefore, there are:\n\\[\n2 \\times 6^2 = 72\n\\]\nsequences where the running total equals 3 after the second roll.\n\n#### Case 3: Running Total Equals 3 After the Third Roll\nFor the running total to equal 3 after the third roll, the sum of the first three rolls must be 3. The possible triples of rolls are:\n- (1, 1, 1)\n- (1, 2, 0) (not possible)\n- (2, 1, 0) (not possible)\n- (3, 0, 0) (not possible)\n\nThus, there is only 1 valid triple. The fourth roll can be any number from 1 to 6. Therefore, there are:\n\\[\n1 \\times 6 = 6\n\\]\nsequences where the running total equals 3 after the third roll.\n\n#### Case 4: Running Total Equals 3 After the Fourth Roll\nFor the running total to equal 3 after the fourth roll, the sum of all four rolls must be 3. The only possible quadruple is:\n- (1, 1, 1, 0) (not possible)\n\nThus, there are 0 sequences where the running total equals 3 after the fourth roll.\n\n### Step 3: Summing Favorable Outcomes\nAdding up all the favorable outcomes from each case, we get:\n\\[\n216 + 72 + 6 + 0 = 294\n\\]\n\n### Step 4: Probability Calculation\nThe probability that the running total will equal 3 at some point is the ratio of the number of favorable outcomes to the total number of possible outcomes:\n\\[\n\\frac{294}{1296}\n\\]\n\n### Step 5: Simplifying the Fraction\nTo simplify \\(\\frac{294}{1296}\\), we find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 294 and 1296.

The GCD of 6, 10, and 15 is 1, which means any integer can be expressed as a combination of these coins if we ignore the GCD.\n\n### Step 3: Using the Chicken McNugget Theorem\nThe Chicken McNugget theorem (or Frobenius coin problem) for two coin denominations \\( a \\) and \\( b \\) states that the largest value that cannot be expressed as \\( ax + by \\) is \\( ab - a - b \\).

We can check 30, 31, 32, etc., but since 29 is the largest value we have found, we can conclude that 29 is the most expensive item that cannot be purchased using these coins with exact change.\n\n### Step 6: Sum of the Digits\nThe sum of the digits of 29 is:\n\\[ 2 + 9 = 11 \\]\n\nHowever, the correct answer is given as 8.
