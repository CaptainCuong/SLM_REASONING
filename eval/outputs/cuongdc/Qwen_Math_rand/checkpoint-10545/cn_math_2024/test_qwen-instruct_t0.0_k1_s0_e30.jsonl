{"question": "A rare species appears on Earth. For each rare organism, the following events occur daily: there is a probability $p (0 \\leq p \\leq 1)$ that it disappears, a probability $\\frac{1-p}{3}$ that it remains unchanged, a probability $\\frac{1-p}{3}$ that it splits into two, and a probability $\\frac{1-p}{3}$ that it splits into three. For all newly produced organisms, the same events occur daily. Assuming initially there is only one such rare organism, determine the maximum value of $p$ such that the probability of this species eventually going extinct does not exceed $\\frac{1}{2}$.", "generated_responses": ["To determine the maximum value of \\( p \\) such that the probability of the species eventually going extinct does not exceed \\(\\frac{1}{2}\\), we need to analyze the behavior of the population over time. Let's denote the probability that the species eventually goes extinct by \\( q \\).\n\n### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Initial Condition:**\n   - Initially, there is one organism. The probability that this single organism eventually goes extinct is \\( q \\).\n\n2. **Transition Probabilities:**\n   - The organism can transition to different states each day:\n     - It disappears with probability \\( p \\).\n     - It remains unchanged with probability \\( \\frac{1-p}{3} \\).\n     - It splits into two with probability \\( \\frac{1-p}{3} \\).\n     - It splits into three with probability \\( \\frac{1-p}{3} \\).\n\n3. **Expected Number of Organisms:**\n   - The expected number of organisms after one day, starting from one organism, is:\n     \\[\n     E[\\text{Number of organisms after one day}] = 1 \\cdot \\frac{1-p}{3} + 2 \\cdot \\frac{1-p}{3} + 3 \\cdot \\frac{1-p}{3} = \\frac{1-p}{3} + \\frac{2(1-p)}{3} + \\frac{3(1-p)}{3} = \\frac{6(1-p)}{3} = 2(1-p)\n     \\]\n\n4. **Extinction Probability:**\n   - If the expected number of organisms after one day is less than 1, the population will eventually go extinct. This is because the expected number of organisms will decrease over time, leading to a high probability of extinction.\n   - Therefore, we need:\n     \\[\n     2(1-p) < 1\n     \\]\n\n5. **Solving the Inequality:**\n   - Solving for \\( p \\):\n     \\[\n     2(1-p) < 1 \\implies 2 - 2p < 1 \\implies 2 - 1 < 2p \\implies 1 < 2p \\implies p > \\frac{1}{2}\n     \\]\n\n6. **Probability of Extinction:**\n   - To ensure that the probability of the species eventually going extinct does not exceed \\(\\frac{1}{2}\\), we need to find the maximum value of \\( p \\) such that the expected number of organisms after one day is exactly 1. This is because if the expected number is exactly 1, the probability of extinction is exactly \\(\\frac{1}{2}\\).\n\n7. **Setting the Expected Number to 1:**\n   - We set the expected number of organisms after one day to 1:\n     \\[\n     2(1-p) = 1 \\implies 2 - 2p = 1 \\implies 2 - 1 = 2p \\implies 1 = 2p \\implies p = \\frac{1}{2}\n     \\]\n\n8. **Verification:**\n   - If \\( p = \\frac{1}{2} \\), the expected number of organisms after one day is:\n     \\[\n     2 \\left(1 - \\frac{1}{2}\\right) = 2 \\cdot \\frac{1}{2} = 1\n     \\]\n   - This means the probability of the species eventually going extinct is exactly \\(\\frac{1}{2}\\).\n\n9. **Finding the Maximum \\( p \\):**\n   - To find the maximum \\( p \\) such that the probability of extinction does not exceed \\(\\frac{1}{2}\\), we need to solve the equation:\n     \\[\n     2(1-p) = \\frac{1}{2} \\implies 2 - 2p = \\frac{1}{2} \\implies 2 - \\frac{1}{2} = 2p \\implies \\frac{3}{2} = 2p \\implies p = \\frac{3}{4}\n     \\]\n\nTherefore, the maximum value of \\( p \\) such that the probability of the species eventually going extinct does not exceed \\(\\frac{1}{2}\\) is \\(\\boxed{\\frac{3}{4}}\\)."], "id": "1", "generated_answers": ["\\frac{3}{4}"], "gold_answer": "\\frac{5}{17}", "is_correct": false, "answers_correctness": [false]}

This implies that the elements of \\( A \\) must be chosen such that no two elements have a difference of 1, 4, 5, or 6.\n\n### Step 2: Simplifying the Problem\nTo simplify the problem, we can consider the residues of the elements of \\( U \\) modulo 7.

The maximum possible difference between any two numbers in the set \\(\\{1, 2, \\ldots, 100\\}\\) is 99 (the difference between 1 and 100).\n\n3. **Constructing the Permutation:**\n   Consider the permutation that alternates between the smallest and largest remaining numbers. For example:\n   \\[\n   x_1 = 1, x_2 = 100, x_3 = 2, x_4 = 99, x_5 = 3, x_6 = 98, \\ldots, x_{99} = 50, x_{100} = 51\n   \\]\n   This permutation ensures that the absolute differences between consecutive elements are maximized.\n\n4. **Calculating the Sum:**\n   Let's calculate \\( S \\) for this permutation:\n   \\[\n   S = \\left|1 - 100\\right| + \\left|100 - 2\\right| + \\left|2 - 99\\right| + \\left|99 - 3\\right| + \\cdots + \\left|50 - 51\\right| + \\left|51 - 1\\right|\n   \\]\n   Each pair of consecutive elements in this permutation has a difference of 99, 98, 97, etc., down to 1. The sum of these differences is:\n   \\[\n   S = 99 + 98 + 97 + \\cdots + 1\n   \\]\n\n5. **Summing the Series:**\n   The sum of the first \\( n \\) positive integers is given by the formula:\n   \\[\n   \\sum_{k=1}^{n} k = \\frac{n(n+1)}{2}\n   \\]\n   Here, \\( n = 99 \\):\n   \\[\n   \\sum_{k=1}^{99} k = \\frac{99 \\times 100}{2} = 4950\n   \\]\n\n6. **Adding the Final Difference:**\n   The final term in the sum is \\( \\left|51 - 1\\right| = 50 \\). Therefore, the total sum \\( S \\) is:\n   \\[\n   S = 4950 + 50 = 5000\n   \\]\n\n7. **Revisiting the Maximum Sum:**\n   However, we need to consider the maximum possible sum by rearranging the terms. The correct approach is to consider the sum of the absolute differences in a way that maximizes the sum. The correct maximum sum is achieved by considering the sum of the absolute differences in a specific pattern that maximizes the sum, which is:\n   \\[\n   S = 99 + 98 + 97 + \\cdots + 1 + 100 = 10000\n   \\]\n\nThus, the maximum value of \\( S \\) is \\(\\boxed{10000}\\)."], "id": "25", "generated_answers": ["10000"], "gold_answer": "5000", "is_correct": false, "answers_correctness": [false]}

Let's assume \\(a_n = an + b\\) for some constants \\(a\\) and \\(b\\).\n\n### Step 2: Use the initial condition\nWe know \\(a_1 = 1\\). Substituting \\(n = 1\\) into the assumed form \\(a_n = an + b\\), we get:\n\\[\na_1 = a \\cdot 1 + b = 1 \\implies a + b = 1\n\\]\n\n### Step 3: Verify the condition with the assumed form\nSubstitute \\(a_n = an + b\\) into the original condition:\n\\[\na_{m+n} + a_{m-n} = a(m+n) + b + a(m-n) + b = 2am + 2b\n\\]\n\\[\n2a_m + 2a_n = 2(am + b) + 2(an + b) = 2am + 2an + 4b\n\\]\nFor the condition to hold, we must have:\n\\[\n2am + 2b = 2am + 2an + 4b \\implies 2b = 2an + 4b \\implies 0 = 2an + 2b \\implies b = -an\n\\]\nSince \\(b\\) must be a constant, \\(a\\) must be zero. However, this contradicts \\(a + b = 1\\). Therefore, we need to re-evaluate our assumption.\n\n### Step 4: Re-evaluate the assumption\nGiven the condition, let's try a different approach. Assume \\(a_n = n\\). Then:\n\\[\na_{m+n} = m+n, \\quad a_{m-n} = m-n, \\quad a_m = m, \\quad a_n = n\n\\]\nSubstitute these into the original condition:\n\\[\n(m+n) + (m-n) = 2m + 2n \\implies 2m = 2m + 2n \\implies 0 = 2n \\implies n = 0\n\\]\nThis is a contradiction since \\(n\\) must be a positive integer. Therefore, \\(a_n = n\\) is not the correct form.\n\n### Step 5: Correct form and verify\nAssume \\(a_n = 2n - 1\\). Then:\n\\[\na_{m+n} = 2(m+n) - 1 = 2m + 2n - 1, \\quad a_{m-n} = 2(m-n) - 1 = 2m - 2n - 1, \\quad a_m = 2m - 1, \\quad a_n = 2n - 1\n\\]\nSubstitute these into the original condition:\n\\[\n(2m + 2n - 1) + (2m - 2n - 1) = 2(2m - 1) + 2(2n - 1) \\implies 4m - 2 = 4m - 2\n\\]\nThis holds true for all \\(m\\) and \\(n\\). Therefore, \\(a_n = 2n - 1\\) is the correct form.\n\n### Step 6: Calculate \\(S_{10}\\)\nThe sum of the first 10 terms \\(S_{10}\\) is:\n\\[\nS_{10} = \\sum_{n=1}^{10} (2n - 1)\n\\]\nThis is the sum of the first 10 odd numbers, which is known to be \\(10^2 = 100\\).\n\nThus, the value of \\(S_{10}\\) is \\(\\boxed{100}\\)."], "id": "30", "generated_answers": ["100"], "gold_answer": "385", "is_correct": false, "answers_correctness": [false]}
