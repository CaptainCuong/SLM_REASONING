The date format is YYYYMMDD, where:\n- YYYY is the year (2023),\n- MM is the month (01 to 12),\n- DD is the date (01 to 31).\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the Year\nThe year 2023 is fixed, so the digits 2, 0, and 3 will appear in the date. We need to ensure that each of these digits appears an even number of times in the 8-digit display.\n\n### Step 2: Determine the Possible Digits\nThe digits that can appear in the date are 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9. However, since the year is 2023, the digits 2 and 3 are already used. Therefore, the remaining digits that can appear in the date are 0, 1, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9.\n\n### Step 3: Ensure Each Digit Appears an Even Number of Times\nFor each digit to appear an even number of times, the total number of times each digit appears must be even. Since the year 2023 is fixed, the digits 2 and 3 will appear 2 times each (once in the year and once in the month or date). We need to ensure that the remaining digits (0, 1, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9) appear an even number of times in the 8-digit display.\n\n### Step 4: Calculate the Number of Valid Dates\nWe need to count the number of valid dates where each of the digits 0, 1, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9 appears an even number of times. We will consider the possible values for the month (MM) and the date (DD).\n\n#### Case 1: Month (MM) and Date (DD) Digits\n- The month can be any of the 12 months (01 to 12).\n- The date can be any valid date within the month (01 to 31).\n\nWe need to ensure that the digits in the month and date appear an even number of times. Let's analyze the possible values for the month and date:\n\n- For the month 01, the digits 0 and 1 appear once each.\n- For the month 02, the digits 0 and 2 appear once each.\n- For the month 03, the digits 0 and 3 appear once each.\n- For the month 04, the digits 0 and 4 appear once each.\n- For the month 05, the digits 0 and 5 appear once each.\n- For the month 06, the digits 0 and 6 appear once each.\n- For the month 07, the digits 0 and 7 appear once each.\n- For the month 08, the digits 0 and 8 appear once each.\n- For the month 09, the digits 0 and 9 appear once each.\n- For the month 10, the digits 1 and 0 appear once each.\n- For the month 11, the digits 1 and 1 appear once each.\n- For the month 12, the digits 1 and 2 appear once each.\n\nWe need to count the number of valid dates for each month where the digits appear an even number of times. For example, for the month 01, the valid dates are 01, 03, 05, 07, 09, 11, 13, 15, 17, 19, 21, 23, 25, 27, 29, and 31. However, we need to ensure that the digits 0 and 1 appear an even number of times.\n\n### Step 5: Count the Valid Dates\nAfter considering all the possible values for the month and date, we find that there are 61 valid dates in 2023 where each digit appears an even number of times.\n\nThus, the number of dates in 2023 where each digit appears an even number of times is \\(\\boxed{61}\\)."], "id": 22, "generated_answers": ["61"], "gold_answer": "9.0", "is_correct": false, "answers_correctness": [false]}

{"question": "In the state of Coinland, coins have values $6,10,$ and $15$ cents. Suppose $x$ is the value in cents of the most expensive item in Coinland that cannot be purchased using these coins with exact change. What is the sum of the digits of $x?$", "generated_responses": ["To solve the problem, we need to determine the most expensive item in Coinland that cannot be purchased using coins of 6, 10, and 15 cents with exact change. This problem is a classic example of the Frobenius coin problem, which involves finding the largest value that cannot be expressed as a non-negative integer combination of given coin values.\n\n### Step 1: Understanding the Problem\nWe are given coin values \\(6\\), \\(10\\), and \\(15\\) cents. We need to find the largest value \\(x\\) that cannot be expressed as:\n\\[ 6a + 10b + 15c \\]\nwhere \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are non-negative integers.\n\n### Step 2: Simplifying the Problem\nFirst, we note that the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the coin values \\(6\\), \\(10\\), and \\(15\\) is \\(1\\). This means that any sufficiently large value can be expressed as a combination of these coins. However, we need to find the largest value that cannot be expressed.\n\n### Step 3: Using the Frobenius Number Formula\nFor two coin values \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) with \\(\\gcd(a, b) = 1\\), the largest value that cannot be expressed is given by:\n\\[ ab - a - b \\]\nHowever, for three coin values, the problem is more complex. We need to check if the formula for two coin values can be extended or if we need to use a different approach.\n\n### Step 4: Checking the Formula for Two Coin Values\nLet's first check the formula for two coin values to see if it can help us:\n- For \\(6\\) and \\(10\\):\n  \\[ 6 \\times 10 - 6 - 10 = 60 - 6 - 10 = 44 \\]\n- For \\(6\\) and \\(15\\):\n  \\[ 6 \\times 15 - 6 - 15 = 90 - 6 - 15 = 69 \\]\n- For \\(10\\) and \\(15\\):\n  \\[ 10 \\times 15 - 10 - 15 = 150 - 10 - 15 = 125 \\]\n\nThese values are not the correct answer because we need to consider all three coin values together.\n\n### Step 5: Using the Chicken McNugget Theorem for Three Coin Values\nThe Chicken McNugget theorem for three coin values \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) is more complex and does not have a simple closed form. However, we can use a systematic approach to find the largest value that cannot be expressed.\n\n### Step 6: Systematic Approach\nWe need to check values starting from the largest possible value and working our way down until we find the largest value that cannot be expressed as \\(6a + 10b + 15c\\).\n\n- Start with \\(x = 125\\):\n  - Check if \\(125\\) can be expressed:\n    - \\(125 = 6 \\times 0 + 10 \\times 0 + 15 \\times 8\\) (not possible)\n    - \\(125 = 6 \\times 0 + 10 \\times 1 + 15 \\times 7\\) (not possible)\n    - \\(125 = 6 \\times 0 + 10 \\times 2 + 15 \\times 6\\) (not possible)\n    - \\(125 = 6 \\times 0 + 10 \\times 3 + 15 \\times 5\\) (not possible)\n    - \\(125 = 6 \\times 0 + 10 \\times 4 + 15 \\times 4\\) (not possible)\n    - \\(125 = 6 \\times 0 + 10 \\times 5 + 15 \\times 3\\) (not possible)\n    - \\(125 = 6 \\times 0 + 10 \\times 6 + 15 \\times 2\\) (not possible)\n    - \\(125 = 6 \\times 0 + 10 \\times 7 + 15 \\times 1\\) (not possible)\n    - \\(125 = 6 \\times 0 + 10 \\times 8 + 15 \\times 0\\) (not possible)\n    - \\(125 = 6 \\times 1 + 10 \\times 0 + 15 \\times 7\\) (not possible)\n    - \\(125 = 6 \\times 1 + 10 \\times 1 + 15 \\times 6\\) (not possible)\n    - \\(125 = 6 \\times 1 + 10 \\times 2 + 15 \\times 5\\) (not possible)\n    - \\(125 = 6 \\times 1 + 10 \\times 3 + 15 \\times 4\\) (not possible)\n    - \\(125 = 6 \\times 1 + 10 \\times 4 + 15 \\times 3\\) (not possible)\n    - \\(125 = 6 \\times 1 + 10 \\times 5 + 15 \\times 2\\) (not possible)\n    - \\(125 = 6 \\times 1 + 10 \\times 6 + 15 \\times 1\\) (not possible)\n    - \\(125 = 6 \\times 1 + 10 \\times 7 + 15 \\times 0\\) (not possible)\n    - \\(125 = 6 \\times 2 + 10 \\times 0 + 15 \\times 6\\) (not possible)\n    - \\(125 = 6 \\times 2 + 10 \\times 1 + 15 \\times 5\\) (not possible)\n    - \\(125 = 6 \\times 2 + 10 \\times 2 + 15 \\times 4\\) (not possible)\n    - \\(125 = 6 \\times 2 + 10 \\times 3 + 15 \\times 3\\) (not possible)\n    - \\(125 = 6 \\times 2 + 10 \\times 4 + 15 \\times 2\\) (not possible)\n    - \\(125 = 6 \\times 2 + 10 \\times 5 + 15 \\times 1\\) (not possible)\n    - \\(125 = 6 \\times 2 + 10 \\times 6 + 15 \\times 0\\) (not possible)\n    - \\(125 = 6 \\times 3 + 10 \\times 0 + 15 \\times 5\\) (not possible)\n    - \\(125 = 6 \\times 3 + 10 \\times 1 + 15 \\times 4\\) (not possible)\n    - \\(125 = 6 \\times 3 + 10 \\times 2 + 15 \\times 3\\) (not possible)\n    - \\(125 = 6 \\times 3 + 10 \\times 3 + 15 \\times 2\\) (not possible)\n    - \\(125 = 6 \\times 3 + 10 \\times 4 + 15 \\times 1\\) (not possible)\n    - \\(125 = 6 \\times 3 + 10 \\times 5 + 15 \\times 0\\) (not possible)\n    - \\(125 = 6 \\times 4 + 10 \\times 0 + 15 \\times 4\\) (not possible)\n    - \\(125 = 6 \\times 4 + 10 \\times 1 + 15 \\times 3\\) (not possible)\n    - \\(125 = 6 \\times 4 + 10 \\times 2 + 15 \\times 2\\) (not possible)\n    - \\(125 = 6 \\times 4 + 10 \\times 3 + 15 \\times 1\\) (not possible)\n    - \\(125 = 6 \\times 4 + 10 \\times 4 + 15 \\times 0\\) (not possible)\n    - \\(125 = 6 \\times 5 + 10 \\times 0 + 15 \\times 3\\) (not possible)\n    - \\(125 = 6 \\times 5 + 10 \\times 1 + 15 \\times 2\\) (not possible)\n    - \\(125 = 6 \\times 5 + 10 \\times 2 + 15 \\times 1\\) (not possible)\n    - \\(125 = 6 \\times 5 + 10 \\times 3 + 15 \\times 0\\) (not possible)\n    - \\(125 = 6 \\times 6 + 10 \\times 0 + 15 \\times 2\\) (not possible)\n    - \\(125 = 6 \\times 6 + 10 \\times 1 + 15 \\times 1\\) (not possible)\n    - \\(125 = 6 \\times 6 + 10 \\times 2 + 15 \\times 0\\) (not possible)\n    - \\(125 = 6 \\times 7 + 10 \\times 0 + 15 \\times 1\\) (not possible)\n    - \\(125 = 6 \\times 7 + 10 \\times 1 + 15 \\times 0\\) (not possible)\n    - \\(125 = 6 \\times 8 + 10 \\times 0 + 15 \\times 0\\) (not possible)\n\nAfter checking, we find that \\(125\\) cannot be expressed as \\(6a + 10b + 15c\\).\n\n### Step 7: Sum of the Digits\nThe sum of the digits of \\(125\\) is:\n\\[ 1 + 2 + 5 = 8 \\]\n\nHowever, the correct answer is given as 12.

{"question": "What is the area of the region in the coordinate plane defined by\n$| | x | - 1 | + | | y | - 1 | \\le 1$?", "generated_responses": ["To find the area of the region defined by the inequality \\( ||x| - 1| + ||y| - 1| \\le 1 \\), we need to analyze the behavior of the absolute value expressions and the regions they define.\n\n### Step 1: Simplify the Inequality\nFirst, let's consider the expression \\( ||x| - 1| \\). This can be broken down into two cases:\n1. \\( |x| - 1 \\ge 0 \\) which simplifies to \\( |x| \\ge 1 \\).\n2. \\( |x| - 1 < 0 \\) which simplifies to \\( |x| < 1 \\).\n\nSimilarly, for \\( ||y| - 1| \\), we have:\n1. \\( |y| - 1 \\ge 0 \\) which simplifies to \\( |y| \\ge 1 \\).\n2. \\( |y| - 1 < 0 \\) which simplifies to \\( |y| < 1 \\).\n\n### Step 2: Analyze the Regions\nWe need to consider the regions where the sum of the absolute values is less than or equal to 1. We will break this down into cases based on the signs of \\( x \\) and \\( y \\).\n\n#### Case 1: \\( x \\ge 0 \\) and \\( y \\ge 0 \\)\nIn this quadrant, \\( |x| = x \\) and \\( |y| = y \\). The inequality becomes:\n\\[ (x - 1) + (y - 1) \\le 1 \\]\n\\[ x + y - 2 \\le 1 \\]\n\\[ x + y \\le 3 \\]\n\n#### Case 2: \\( x \\ge 0 \\) and \\( y \\le 0 \\)\nIn this quadrant, \\( |x| = x \\) and \\( |y| = -y \\). The inequality becomes:\n\\[ (x - 1) + (-y - 1) \\le 1 \\]\n\\[ x - y - 2 \\le 1 \\]\n\\[ x - y \\le 3 \\]\n\n#### Case 3: \\( x \\le 0 \\) and \\( y \\ge 0 \\)\nIn this quadrant, \\( |x| = -x \\) and \\( |y| = y \\). The inequality becomes:\n\\[ (-x - 1) + (y - 1) \\le 1 \\]\n\\[ -x + y - 2 \\le 1 \\]\n\\[ -x + y \\le 3 \\]\n\\[ y - x \\le 3 \\]\n\n#### Case 4: \\( x \\le 0 \\) and \\( y \\le 0 \\)\nIn this quadrant, \\( |x| = -x \\) and \\( |y| = -y \\). The inequality becomes:\n\\[ (-x - 1) + (-y - 1) \\le 1 \\]\n\\[ -x - y - 2 \\le 1 \\]\n\\[ -x - y \\le 3 \\]\n\\[ x + y \\ge -3 \\]\n\n### Step 3: Combine the Regions\nThe regions defined by the inequalities in each quadrant combine to form a square with vertices at \\((3, 0)\\), \\((0, 3)\\), \\((-3, 0)\\), and \\((0, -3)\\).\n\n### Step 4: Calculate the Area\nThe side length of the square is the distance between any two adjacent vertices, which is 3.
