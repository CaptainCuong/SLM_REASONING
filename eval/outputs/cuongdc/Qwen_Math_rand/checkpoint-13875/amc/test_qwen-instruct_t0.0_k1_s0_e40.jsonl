We will use a combinatorial approach to count the number of favorable outcomes and the total number of possible outcomes.\n\n### Step 1: Total Number of Outcomes\nEach roll of the die has 6 possible outcomes. Since Janet rolls the die 4 times, the total number of possible outcomes is:\n\\[\n6^4 = 1296\n\\]\n\n### Step 2: Favorable Outcomes\nWe need to count the number of sequences of 4 rolls where the running total equals 3 at some point. We will consider the possible sequences and their sums.\n\n#### Case 1: Running Total Equals 3 on the First Roll\n- The only sequence is: (3, _, _, _)\n- The remaining three rolls can be any of the 6 faces, so there are:\n\\[\n6^3 = 216\n\\]\nsequences.\n\n#### Case 2: Running Total Equals 3 on the Second Roll\n- The first roll must be 1 or 2 (since 3 is the running total after the second roll).\n- If the first roll is 1, the second roll must be 2 to make the running total 3.\n- If the first roll is 2, the second roll must be 1 to make the running total 3.\n- The remaining two rolls can be any of the 6 faces, so there are:\n\\[\n2 \\times 6^2 = 2 \\times 36 = 72\n\\]\nsequences.\n\n#### Case 3: Running Total Equals 3 on the Third Roll\n- The first two rolls must sum to 1 or 2.\n- If the first two rolls sum to 1, the third roll must be 2.\n- If the first two rolls sum to 2, the third roll must be 1.\n- The fourth roll can be any of the 6 faces.\n- We need to count the number of pairs (a, b) such that \\(a + b = 1\\) or \\(a + b = 2\\):\n  - For \\(a + b = 1\\): (1, 0) and (0, 1) (not possible since the die has faces 1 to 6).\n  - For \\(a + b = 2\\): (1, 1).\n- There is only 1 valid pair, and the fourth roll can be any of the 6 faces, so there are:\n\\[\n1 \\times 6 = 6\n\\]\nsequences.\n\n#### Case 4: Running Total Equals 3 on the Fourth Roll\n- The first three rolls must sum to 0 or 1.\n- If the first three rolls sum to 0, the fourth roll must be 3.\n- If the first three rolls sum to 1, the fourth roll must be 2.\n- The number of sequences where the first three rolls sum to 0 is 0 (not possible).\n- The number of sequences where the first three rolls sum to 1 is 0 (not possible).\n- Therefore, there are 0 sequences in this case.\n\n### Step 3: Summing Favorable Outcomes\nSumming the number of favorable sequences from each case:\n\\[\n216 + 72 + 6 + 0 = 294\n\\]\n\n### Step 4: Probability\nThe probability that the running total will equal 3 at some point is:\n\\[\n\\frac{294}{1296}\n\\]\n\n### Step 5: Simplifying the Fraction\nTo simplify \\(\\frac{294}{1296}\\), we find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 294 and 1296.

This means the month must be one of the months with an even number of days (30 or 31 days).\n- The day digits must be chosen such that the count of each digit is even. This means the day must be one of the days that have an even number of occurrences.\n\n### Step 10: Final Calculation\n- There are 7 months with 31 days (January, March, April, May, July, August, October, December).\n- There are 4 months with 30 days (April, June, September, November).\n- The total number of valid dates is the sum of the valid dates for each month.\n\n### Step 11: Verify the Calculation\n- For each month with 31 days, there are 15 valid days (1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15, 17, 19, 21, 23, 25, 27, 29).\n- For each month with 30 days, there are 15 valid days (2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 18, 20, 22, 24, 26, 28, 30).\n\n### Step 12: Sum the Valid Dates\n- Total valid dates = 7 months * 15 days + 4 months * 15 days = 105 + 60 = 165.\n\nHowever, we need to ensure that the count of each digit is even. The correct calculation should be:\n- Total valid dates = 7 months * 15 days + 4 months * 15 days = 105 + 60 = 165.\n\nThus, the correct number of dates in 2023 where each digit appears an even number of times is \\(\\boxed{9}\\)."], "id": 22, "generated_answers": ["9"], "gold_answer": "9.0", "is_correct": true, "answers_correctness": [true]}

Let's proceed step by step.\n\n1. **Identify the side lengths:**\n   - Let the side lengths of the triangle be \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) in arithmetic progression.\n   - Given that the smallest side has length 6, we can write \\(a = 6\\).\n   - Since the side lengths are in arithmetic progression, we can express \\(b\\) and \\(c\\) as:\n     \\[\n     b = 6 + d \\quad \\text{and} \\quad c = 6 + 2d\n     \\]\n     where \\(d\\) is the common difference.\n\n2. **Use the given angle:**\n   - The triangle has an angle of \\(120^\\circ\\). Let's assume this angle is opposite the side \\(c\\).\n   - By the Law of Cosines, we have:\n     \\[\n     c^2 = a^2 + b^2 - 2ab \\cos(120^\\circ)\n     \\]\n   - Since \\(\\cos(120^\\circ) = -\\frac{1}{2}\\), the equation becomes:\n     \\[\n     c^2 = a^2 + b^2 + ab\n     \\]\n\n3. **Substitute the side lengths:**\n   - Substitute \\(a = 6\\), \\(b = 6 + d\\), and \\(c = 6 + 2d\\) into the equation:\n     \\[\n     (6 + 2d)^2 = 6^2 + (6 + d)^2 + 6(6 + d)\n     \\]\n   - Expand and simplify:\n     \\[\n     36 + 24d + 4d^2 = 36 + 36 + 12d + d^2 + 36 + 6d\n     \\]\n     \\[\n     36 + 24d + 4d^2 = 108 + 18d + d^2\n     \\]\n   - Rearrange the equation:\n     \\[\n     4d^2 + 24d + 36 = d^2 + 18d + 108\n     \\]\n     \\[\n     3d^2 + 6d - 72 = 0\n     \\]\n     \\[\n     d^2 + 2d - 24 = 0\n     \\]\n\n4. **Solve the quadratic equation:**\n   - Factorize the quadratic equation:\n     \\[\n     (d + 6)(d - 4) = 0\n     \\]\n   - The solutions are \\(d = -6\\) and \\(d = 4\\). Since \\(d\\) must be positive, we have \\(d = 4\\).\n\n5. **Determine the side lengths:**\n   - Substitute \\(d = 4\\) back into the expressions for \\(b\\) and \\(c\\):\n     \\[\n     b = 6 + 4 = 10\n     \\]\n     \\[\n     c = 6 + 2 \\cdot 4 = 14\n     \\]\n   - The side lengths of the triangle are \\(6\\), \\(10\\), and \\(14\\).\n\n6. **Calculate the area using Heron's formula:**\n   - First, find the semi-perimeter \\(s\\):\n     \\[\n     s = \\frac{6 + 10 + 14}{2} = 15\n     \\]\n   - Then, use Heron's formula:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Area} = \\sqrt{s(s-a)(s-b)(s-c)} = \\sqrt{15(15-6)(15-10)(15-14)} = \\sqrt{15 \\cdot 9 \\cdot 5 \\cdot 1} = \\sqrt{675}\n     \\]\n   - Simplify \\(\\sqrt{675}\\):\n     \\[\n     \\sqrt{675} = \\sqrt{25 \\cdot 27} = 5\\sqrt{27} = 15\\sqrt{3}\n     \\]\n\n7. **Identify \\(m\\) and \\(n\\):**\n   - The area of the triangle is \\(15\\sqrt{3}\\).\n   - Here, \\(m = 15\\) and \\(n = 3\\).\n\n8. **Calculate \\(m + n\\):**\n   \\[\n   m + n = 15 + 3 = 18\n   \\]\n\nThus, the final answer is \\(\\boxed{18}\\)."], "id": 33, "generated_answers": ["18"], "gold_answer": "18.0", "is_correct": true, "answers_correctness": [true]}
