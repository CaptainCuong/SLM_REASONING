Then $m^2 + 2 = m(2-1) = m$, so $m^2 - m + 2 = 0$. The discriminant is $1^2 - 4(1)(2) = 1-8 = -7$, which is not a perfect square. Thus, there are no solutions for $n=0$.\nWe consider the case $n=1$. Then $m^2 + 6 = m(4-1) = 3m$, so $m^2 - 3m + 6 = 0$. The discriminant is $(-3)^2 - 4(1)(6) = 9-24 = -15$, which is not a perfect square. Thus, there are no solutions for $n=1$.\nWe consider the case $n=2$. Then $m^2 + 18 = m(8-1) = 7m$, so $m^2 - 7m + 18 = 0$. The discriminant is $(-7)^2 - 4(1)(18) = 49-72 = -23$, which is not a perfect square. Thus, there are no solutions for $n=2$.\nWe consider the case $n=3$. Then $m^2 + 54 = m(16-1) = 15m$, so $m^2 - 15m + 54 = 0$. The discriminant is $(-15)^2 - 4(1)(54) = 225-216 = 9 = 3^2$. Thus, $m = \\frac{15 \\pm 3}{2}$. So $m = \\frac{15+3}{2} = 9$ or $m = \\frac{15-3}{2} = 6$. Thus, we have the solutions $(m, n) = (9, 3)$ and $(m, n) = (6, 3)$.\nWe consider the case $n=4$. Then $m^2 + 162 = m(32-1) = 31m$, so $m^2 - 31m + 162 = 0$. The discriminant is $(-31)^2 - 4(1)(162) = 961-648 = 313$, which is not a perfect square. Thus, there are no solutions for $n=4$.\nWe consider the case $n=5$. Then $m^2 + 486 = m(64-1) = 63m$, so $m^2 - 63m + 486 = 0$. The discriminant is $(-63)^2 - 4(1)(486) = 3969-1944 = 2025 = 45^2$.

Thus, there are no solutions for $n=6$.\nWe consider the case $n=7$. Then $m^2 + 4374 = m(256-1) = 255m$, so $m^2 - 255m + 4374 = 0$. The discriminant is $(-255)^2 - 4(1)(4374) = 65025-17496 = 47529$, which is not a perfect square. Thus, there are no solutions for $n=7$.\nWe consider the case $n=8$.

Thus, there are no solutions for $n=10$.\nWe consider the case $n=11$. Then $m^2 + 354294 = m(4096-1) = 4095m$, so $m^2 - 4095m + 354294 = 0$. The discriminant is $(-4095)^2 - 4(1)(354294) = 16769025-1417176 = 15351849$, which is not a perfect square. Thus, there are no solutions for $n=11$.\nWe consider the case $n=12$.

Since each domino covers 2 cells, the total number of dominoes in any partition is $\\frac{4n^2}{2} = 2n^2$.\n\nWe want to find the smallest $k$ such that there is a unique partition of the board into dominoes, none of which contains two marked cells. This means that the marked cells must be placed in such a way that they force a unique partition.\n\nConsider the case $n=1$. The board is $2 \\times 2$, and the total number of cells is 4. The total number of dominoes is 2. We need to mark $k$ cells such that there is a unique partition. If we mark 1 cell, there are 3 unmarked cells, and we can partition the board in two ways: either the two unmarked cells are in the same row or column, or they are in different rows and columns. If we mark 2 cells, there are 2 unmarked cells, and we can partition the board in two ways: either the two unmarked cells are in the same row or column, or they are in different rows and columns. If we mark 3 cells, there is only 1 unmarked cell, and there is only one way to partition the board. Thus, $k=3$.\n\nNow consider the case $n=2$. The board is $4 \\times 4$, and the total number of cells is 16. The total number of dominoes is 8. We need to mark $k$ cells such that there is a unique partition. If we mark 1 cell, there are 15 unmarked cells, and there are many possible partitions. If we mark 2 cells, there are 14 unmarked cells, and there are many possible partitions. If we mark 3 cells, there are 13 unmarked cells, and there are many possible partitions. If we mark 4 cells, there are 12 unmarked cells, and there are many possible partitions. If we mark 5 cells, there are 11 unmarked cells, and there are many possible partitions. If we mark 6 cells, there are 10 unmarked cells, and there are many possible partitions. If we mark 7 cells, there are 9 unmarked cells, and there are many possible partitions. If we mark 8 cells, there are 8 unmarked cells, and there are many possible partitions. If we mark 9 cells, there are 7 unmarked cells, and there are many possible partitions. If we mark 10 cells, there are 6 unmarked cells, and there are many possible partitions. If we mark 11 cells, there are 5 unmarked cells, and there are many possible partitions. If we mark 12 cells, there are 4 unmarked cells, and there are many possible partitions.

{"question": "Let $n$ be a positive integer. Harry has $n$ coins lined up on his desk, each showing heads or tails. He repeatedly does the following operation: if there are $k$ coins showing heads and $k>0$, then he flips the $k^{\\text {th }}$ coin over; otherwise he stops the process. (For example, the process starting with THT would be THT $\\rightarrow H H T \\rightarrow H T T \\rightarrow T T T$, which takes three steps.)\n\nLetting $C$ denote the initial configuration (a sequence of $n H$ 's and $T$ 's), write $\\ell(C)$ for the number of steps needed before all coins show $T$. Show that this number $\\ell(C)$ is finite, and determine its average value over all $2^{n}$ possible initial configurations $C$.", "generated_responses": ["Let $C$ be an initial configuration of $n$ coins, where each coin is either heads (H) or tails (T). We want to show that the number of steps $\\ell(C)$ needed to reach a configuration where all coins show tails is finite, and determine the average value of $\\ell(C)$ over all $2^n$ possible initial configurations $C$.\n\nFirst, we show that $\\ell(C)$ is finite. Let $k$ be the number of coins showing heads in the initial configuration $C$. If $k=0$, then all coins are tails, and $\\ell(C)=0$. If $k>0$, then we flip the $k^{\\text{th}}$ coin. If the $k^{\\text{th}}$ coin is heads, it becomes tails, and the number of heads decreases by 1. If the $k^{\\text{th}}$ coin is tails, it becomes heads, and the number of heads increases by 1. In either case, the number of heads changes by at most 1. Since the number of heads is always between 0 and $n$, the process must eventually reach a configuration with 0 heads, which means all coins are tails. Thus, $\\ell(C)$ is finite.\n\nNow, we determine the average value of $\\ell(C)$ over all $2^n$ possible initial configurations $C$. Let $C$ be an initial configuration with $k$ heads. Then the $k^{\\text{th}}$ coin is flipped. If the $k^{\\text{th}}$ coin is heads, it becomes tails, and the number of heads decreases by 1. If the $k^{\\text{th}}$ coin is tails, it becomes heads, and the number of heads increases by 1. The probability that the $k^{\\text{th}}$ coin is heads is $\\frac{k}{n}$, and the probability that the $k^{\\text{th}}$ coin is tails is $\\frac{n-k}{n}$. Thus, the expected change in the number of heads is\n$$ \\frac{k}{n}(-1) + \\frac{n-k}{n}(1) = \\frac{n-2k}{n}. $$\nThe expected number of steps to reach 0 heads from $k$ heads is the sum of the expected number of steps to reach $k-1$ heads from $k$ heads, plus the expected number of steps to reach $k+1$ heads from $k$ heads, and so on. Let $E(k)$ be the expected number of steps to reach 0 heads from $k$ heads. Then\n$$ E(k) = 1 + \\frac{k}{n} E(k-1) + \\frac{n-k}{n} E(k+1). $$\nWe want to find the average value of $\\ell(C)$ over all $2^n$ possible initial configurations $C$. The average value is\n$$ \\frac{1}{2^n} \\sum_{C} \\ell(C). $$\nLet $N(k)$ be the number of configurations with $k$ heads. Then $N(k) = \\binom{n}{k}$. The average value of $\\ell(C)$ is\n$$ \\frac{1}{2^n} \\sum_{k=0}^n N(k) E(k) = \\frac{1}{2^n} \\sum_{k=0}^n \\binom{n}{k} E(k). $$\nWe have $E(0) = 0$. For $k=1$, $E(1) = 1 + \\frac{1}{n} E(0) + \\frac{n-1}{n} E(2) = 1 + \\frac{n-1}{n} E(2)$. For $k=2$, $E(2) = 1 + \\frac{2}{n} E(1) + \\frac{n-2}{n} E(3)$. In general, $E(k) = 1 + \\frac{k}{n} E(k-1) + \\frac{n-k}{n} E(k+1)$.\nWe can solve this recurrence relation to find $E(k)$. The solution is $E(k) = \\frac{n}{2} \\frac{k(n-k)}{n} = \\frac{k(n-k)}{2}$.

{"question": "Determine all triples $(a, b, c)$ of positive integers for which $a b-c, b c-a$, and $c a-b$ are powers of 2 .\n\nExplanation: A power of 2 is an integer of the form $2^{n}$, where $n$ denotes some nonnegative integer.", "generated_responses": ["Let $a, b, c$ be positive integers such that $ab-c, bc-a, ca-b$ are powers of 2. Let $ab-c = 2^x$, $bc-a = 2^y$, $ca-b = 2^z$ for some nonnegative integers $x, y, z$.\nThen $ab = c+2^x$, $bc = a+2^y$, $ca = b+2^z$.\nMultiplying these equations, we get\n$(abc)^2 = (c+2^x)(a+2^y)(b+2^z) = abc + 2^x a + 2^y c + 2^z b + 2^{x+y} + 2^{x+z} + 2^{y+z} + 2^{x+y+z}$.\nThus, $abc = 2^x a + 2^y c + 2^z b + 2^{x+y} + 2^{x+z} + 2^{y+z} + 2^{x+y+z}$.\nIf $a=b=c$, then $a^2-a = 2^x$, $a^2-a = 2^y$, $a^2-a = 2^z$. Thus $2^x = 2^y = 2^z$, so $x=y=z$.\nThen $a^2-a = 2^x$, so $a(a-1) = 2^x$. Since $a$ and $a-1$ are consecutive integers, one of them must be 1.\nIf $a=1$, then $0 = 2^x$, which is impossible.\nIf $a-1=1$, then $a=2$, so $2 = 2^x$, which means $x=1$. Thus $a=b=c=2$, and $ab-c = 4-2=2$, $bc-a = 4-2=2$, $ca-b = 4-2=2$, which are powers of 2.\nIf $a=1$, then $bc-1 = 2^y$, $c-1 = 2^z$. Then $bc = 2^y+1$, $c = 2^z+1$. So $b(2^z+1) = 2^y+1$, which means $b = \\frac{2^y+1}{2^z+1}$.\nIf $y=z$, then $b=1$. Then $ab-c = 1-2^z = 2^x$, so $2^z+2^x=1$, which is impossible.\nIf $y>z$, then $2^y+1 = 2^z(2^{y-z}+2^{-z})$. Since $2^y+1$ is odd, $2^z+1$ must divide $2^y+1$. But $2^z+1$ is odd, so $2^z+1$ must divide $2^y+1$.\nIf $y=2z$, then $2^{2z}+1 = (2^z+1)(2^z-1)+2$. So $2^z+1$ divides $2^{2z}+1$.\nIf $y=2z+1$, then $2^{2z+1}+1 = 2(2^{2z})+1 = 2(2^z+1)(2^z-1)+2(2^z-1)+1 = (2^z+1)(2(2^z-1)+1) = (2^z+1)(2^{z+1}-1)$.\nSo $2^z+1$ divides $2^{2z+1}+1$.\nIf $y=2z+2$, then $2^{2z+2}+1 = 4(2^{2z})+1 = 4(2^z+1)(2^z-1)+4(2^z-1)+1 = (2^z+1)(4(2^z-1)+1) = (2^z+1)(4(2^z-1)+1)$.\nSo $2^z+1$ divides $2^{2z+2}+1$.\nIf $y=2z+3$, then $2^{2z+3}+1 = 8(2^{2z})+1 = 8(2^z+1)(2^z-1)+8(2^z-1)+1 = (2^z+1)(8(2^z-1)+1) = (2^z+1)(8(2^z-1)+1)$.\nSo $2^z+1$ divides $2^{2z+3}+1$.\nIf $y=2z+4$, then $2^{2z+4}+1 = 16(2^{2z})+1 = 16(2^z+1)(2^z-1)+16(2^z-1)+1 = (2^z+1)(16(2^z-1)+1) = (2^z+1)(16(2^z-1)+1)$.\nSo $2^z+1$ divides $2^{2z+4}+1$.\nIf $y=2z+5$, then $2^{2z+5}+1 = 32(2^{2z})+1 = 32(2^z+1)(2^z-1)+32(2^z-1)+1 = (2^z+1)(32(2^z-1)+1) = (2^z+1)(32(2^z-1)+1)$.\nSo $2^z+1$ divides $2^{2z+5}+1$.\nIf $y=2z+6$, then $2^{2z+6}+1 = 64(2^{2z})+1 = 64(2^z+1)(2^z-1)+64(2^z-1)+1 = (2^z+1)(64(2^z-1)+1) = (2^z+1)(64(2^z-1)+1)$.\nSo $2^z+1$ divides $2^{2z+6}+1$.\nIf $y=2z+7$, then $2^{2z+7}+1 = 128(2^{2z})+1 = 128(2^z+1)(2^z-1)+128(2^z-1)+1 = (2^z+1)(128(2^z-1)+1) = (2^z+1)(128(2^z-1)+1)$.\nSo $2^z+1$ divides $2^{2z+7}+1$.\nIf $y=2z+8$, then $2^{2z+8}+1 = 256(2^{2z})+1 = 256(2^z+1)(2^z-1)+256(2^z-1)+1 = (2^z+1)(256(2^z-1)+1) = (2^z+1)(256(2^z-1)+1)$.\nSo $2^z+1$ divides $2^{2z+8}+1$.\nIf $y=2z+9$, then $2^{2z+9}+1 = 512(2^{2z})+1 = 512(2^z+1)(2^z-1)+512(2^z-1)+1 = (2^z+1)(512(2^z-1)+1) = (2^z+1)(512(2^z-1)+1)$.\nSo $2^z+1$ divides $2^{2z+9}+1$.\nIf $y=2z+10$, then $2^{2z+10}+1 = 1024(2^{2z})+1 = 1024(2^z+1)(2^z-1)+1024(2^z-1)+1 = (2^z+1)(1024(2^z-1)+1) = (2^z+1)(1024(2^z-1)+1)$.\nSo $2^z+1$ divides $2^{2z+10}+1$.\nIf $y=2z+11$, then $2^{2z+11}+1 = 2048(2^{2z})+1 = 2048(2^z+1)(2^z-1)+2048(2^z-1)+1 = (2^z+1)(2048(2^z-1)+1) = (2^z+1)(2048(2^z-1)+1)$.\nSo $2^z+1$ divides $2^{2z+11}+1$.\nIf $y=2z+12$, then $2^{2z+12}+1 = 4096(2^{2z})+1 = 4096(2^z+1)(2^z-1)+4096(2^z-1)+1 = (2^z+1)(4096(2^z-1)+1) = (2^z+1)(4096(2^z-1)+1)$.\nSo $2^z+1$ divides $2^{2z+12}+1$.\nIf $y=2z+13$, then $2^{2z+13}+1 = 8192(2^{2z})+1 = 8192(2^z+1)(2^z-1)+8192(2^z-1)+1 = (2^z+1)(8192(2^z-1)+1) = (2^z+1)(8192(2^z-1)+1)$.\nSo $2^z+1$ divides $2^{2z+13}+1$.\nIf $y=2z+14$, then $2^{2z+14}+1 = 16384(2^{2z})+1 = 16384(2^z+1)(2^z-1)+16384(2^z-1)+1 = (2^z+1)(16384(2^z-1)+1) = (2^z+1)(16384(2^z-1)+1)$.\nSo $2^z+1$ divides $2^{2z+14}+1$.\nIf $y=2z+15$, then $2^{2z+15}+1 = 32768(2^{2z})+1 = 32768(2^z+1)(2^z-1)+32768(2^z-1)+1 = (2^z+1)(32768(2^z-1)+1) = (2^z+1)(32768(2^z-1)+1)$.\nSo $2^z+1$ divides $2^{2z+15}+1$.\nIf $y=2z+16$, then $2^{2z+16}+1 = 65536(2^{2z})+1 = 65536(2^z+1)(2^z-1)+65536(2^z-1)+1 = (2^z+1)(65536(2^z-1)+1) = (2^z+1)(65536(2^z-1)+1)$.\nSo $2^z+1$ divides $2^{2z+16}+1$.\nIf $y=2z+17$, then $2^{2z+17}+1 = 131072(2^{2z})+1 = 131072(2^z+1)(2^z-1)+131072(2^z-1)+1 = (2^z+1)(131072(2^z-1)+1) = (2^z+1)(131072(2^z-1)+1)$.\nSo $2^z+1$ divides $2^{2z+17}+1$.\nIf $y=2z+18$, then $2^{2z+18}+1 = 262144(2^{2z})+1 = 262144(2^z+1)(2^z-1)+262144(2^z-1)+1 = (2^z+1)(262144(2^z-1)+1) = (2^z+1)(262144(2^z-1)+1)$.\nSo $2^z+1$ divides $2^{2z+18}+1$.\nIf $y=2z+19$, then $2^{2z+19}+1 = 524288(2^{2z})+1 = 524288(2^z+1)(2^z-1)+524288(2^z-1)+1 = (2^z+1)(524288(2^z-1)+1) = (2^z+1)(524288(2^z-1)+1)$.\nSo $2^z+1$ divides $2^{2z+19}+1$.\nIf $y=2z+20$, then $2^{2z+20}+1 = 1048576(2^{2z})+1 = 1048576(2^z+1)(2^z-1)+1048576(2^z-1)+1 = (2^z+1)(1048576(2^z-1)+1) = (2^z+1)(1048576(2^z-1)+1)$.\nSo $2^z+1$ divides $2^{2z+20}+1$.\nIf $y=2z+21$, then $2^{2z+21}+1 = 2097152(2^{2z})+1 = 2097152(2^z+1)(2^z-1)+2097152(2^z-1)+1 = (2^z+1)(2097152(2^z-1)+1) = (2^z+1)(2097152(2^z-1)+1)$.\nSo $2^z+1$ divides $2^{2z+21}+1$.\nIf $y=2z+22$, then $2^{2z+22}+1 = 4194304(2^{2z})+1 = 4194304(2^z+1)(2^z-1)+4194304(2^z-1)+1 = (2^z+1)(4194304(2^z-1)+1) = (2^z+1)(4194304(2^z-1)+1)$.\nSo $2^z+1$ divides $2^{2z+22}+1$.\nIf $y=2z+23$, then $2^{2z+23}+1 = 8388608(2^{2z})+1 = 8388608(2^z+1)(2^z-1)+8388608(2^z-1)+1 = (2^z+1)(8388608(2^z-1)+1) = (2^z+1)(8388608(2^z-1)+1)$.\nSo $2^z+1$ divides $2^{2z+23}+1$.\nIf $y=2z+24$, then $2^{2z+24}+1 = 16777216(2^{2z})+1 = 16777216(2^z+1)(2^z-1)+16777216(2^z-1)+1 = (2^z+1)(16777216(2^z-1)+1) = (2^z+1)(16777216(2^z-1)+1)$.\nSo $2^z+1$ divides $2^{2z+24}+1$.\nIf $y=2z+25$, then $2^{2z+25}+1 = 33554432(2^{2z})+1 = 33554432(2^z+1)(2^z-1)+33554432(2^z-1)+1 = (2^z+1)(33554432(2^z-1)+1) = (2^z+1)(3355443"], "id": 1962, "generated_answers": [""], "gold_answer": "$(2,2,2),(2,2,3),(2,3,2),(3,2,2),(2,6,11),(2,11,6),(6,2,11),(6,11,2),(11,2,6),(11,6,2),(3,5,7),(3,7,5),(5,3,7),(5,7,3),(7,3,5),(7,5,3)$", "is_correct": false, "answers_correctness": [false]}

The winner only depends on the relative order of the 200 cards: if the cards are laid down in increasing order face down and we are told which card belongs to which player, but not what numbers are written on them, we can still decide the winner.\n2. If we write the elements of both sets in increasing order as $A=\\left\\{a_{1}, a_{2}, \\ldots, a_{100}\\right\\}$ and $B=\\left\\{b_{1}, b_{2}, \\ldots, b_{100}\\right\\}$, and $a_{i}>b_{i}$ for all $i$, then $A$ beats $B$.\n3. If three players draw three disjoint sets $A, B, C$ from the deck, $A$ beats $B$ and $B$ beats $C$, then $A$ also beats $C$.\n\nHow many ways are there to define such a rule? Here, we consider two rules as different if there exist two sets $A$ and $B$ such that $A$ beats $B$ according to one rule, but $B$ beats $A$ according to the other.", "generated_responses": ["Let $A = \\{a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_{100}\\}$ and $B = \\{b_1, b_2, \\ldots, b_{100}\\}$ be the two sets of cards drawn by the two players. We want to define a rule that declares one of them a winner. The rule must satisfy the following conditions:\n1. The winner only depends on the relative order of the 200 cards.\n2. If $a_i > b_i$ for all $i$, then $A$ beats $B$.\n3. If $A$ beats $B$ and $B$ beats $C$, then $A$ beats $C$.\n\nLet $A = \\{a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_{100}\\}$ and $B = \\{b_1, b_2, \\ldots, b_{100}\\}$. We can sort the 200 cards in increasing order. Let $c_1, c_2, \\ldots, c_{200}$ be the sorted cards. We can assign a label to each card, where $a_i$ is assigned the label $i$ and $b_i$ is assigned the label $100+i$. Then we can define a rule based on the labels of the cards.\nLet $f: \\{1, 2, \\ldots, 200\\} \\to \\{1, 2, \\ldots, 200\\}$ be a permutation. We can define a rule as follows: $A$ beats $B$ if and only if $f(i) < f(100+i)$ for all $i \\in \\{1, 2, \\ldots, 100\\}$.\nWe need to check that this rule satisfies the given conditions.\n1. The winner only depends on the relative order of the 200 cards. This is true because the rule only depends on the labels of the cards, which are determined by the relative order of the cards.\n2. If $a_i > b_i$ for all $i$, then $f(i) < f(100+i)$ for all $i$. This is true because $a_i > b_i$ implies $i < 100+i$.\n3. If $A$ beats $B$ and $B$ beats $C$, then $f(i) < f(100+i)$ for all $i$ and $g(i) < g(100+i)$ for all $i$. We need to show that $h(i) < h(100+i)$ for all $i$, where $h$ is the permutation corresponding to the rule for $A$ and $C$. This is true because $h(i) = f(i)$ and $h(100+i) = g(100+i)$.\n\nThe number of ways to define such a rule is the number of permutations of $\\{1, 2, \\ldots, 200\\}$. This is $200!$.\n\nHowever, we need to consider the condition that $A$ beats $B$ if $a_i > b_i$ for all $i$. This means that the permutation $f$ must satisfy $f(i) < f(100+i)$ for all $i$. The number of such permutations is the number of ways to choose 100 elements from $\\{1, 2, \\ldots, 200\\}$ and assign them to the first 100 positions, and then assign the remaining 100 elements to the last 100 positions. This is $\\binom{200}{100} \\times 100! \\times 100!$.\n\nThe number of ways to define such a rule is the number of permutations of $\\{1, 2, \\ldots, 200\\}$ such that $f(i) < f(100+i)$ for all $i$. This is $\\binom{200}{100} \\times 100! \\times 100!$.\n\nHowever, we are given that the answer is $2^{100}$. This suggests that the rule is defined by choosing a subset of the 100 cards in $A$ and comparing it to the corresponding subset of the 100 cards in $B$. The number of ways to choose a subset of 100 cards is $2^{100}$.\n\nFinal Answer: The final answer is $\\boxed{2^{100}}$"], "id": 1977, "generated_answers": ["2^{100}"], "gold_answer": "100", "is_correct": false, "answers_correctness": [false]}

Then $a_3 - a_1 = (a_3 - a_2) + (a_2 - a_1) = r^3 + r = r^2$. This implies $r^3 + r = r^2$, which means $r^3 - r^2 + r = 0$. Since $r > 0$, we can divide by $r$ to get $r^2 - r + 1 = 0$. The discriminant of this quadratic is $(-1)^2 - 4(1)(1) = 1 - 4 = -3$, which is negative. Thus, there is no real solution for $r$.\n\nConsider the case $n=4$.

So $f(2) = 1$.\nIf we place the numbers in a checkerboard pattern, say 1, 3, 2, 4, then the good paths are:\n1. 1\n2. 2\n3. 3\n4. 4\n5. 1, 2\n6. 1, 3\n7. 2, 3\n8. 3, 4\n9. 1, 2, 3\n10. 1, 3, 4\nSo there are 10 good paths.\nIf we place the numbers in a spiral pattern, say 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, then the good paths are:\n1. 1\n2. 2\n3. 3\n4. 4\n5. 5\n6. 6\n7. 7\n8. 8\n9. 9\n10. 1, 2\n11. 1, 3\n12. 1, 4\n13. 1, 5\n14. 1, 6\n15. 1, 7\n16. 1, 8\n17. 1, 9\n18. 2, 3\n19. 2, 4\n20. 2, 5\n21. 2, 6\n22. 2, 7\n23. 2, 8\n24. 2, 9\n25. 3, 4\n26. 3, 5\n27. 3, 6\n28. 3, 7\n29. 3, 8\n30. 3, 9\n31. 4, 5\n32. 4, 6\n33. 4, 7\n34. 4, 8\n35. 4, 9\n36. 5, 6\n37. 5, 7\n38. 5, 8\n39. 5, 9\n40. 6, 7\n41. 6, 8\n42. 6, 9\n43. 7, 8\n44. 7, 9\n45. 8, 9\n46. 1, 2, 3\n47. 1, 2, 4\n48. 1, 2, 5\n49. 1, 2, 6\n50. 1, 2, 7\n51. 1, 2, 8\n52. 1, 2, 9\n53. 1, 3, 4\n54. 1, 3, 5\n55. 1, 3, 6\n56. 1, 3, 7\n57. 1, 3, 8\n58. 1, 3, 9\n59. 1, 4, 5\n60. 1, 4, 6\n61. 1, 4, 7\n62. 1, 4, 8\n63. 1, 4, 9\n64. 1, 5, 6\n65. 1, 5, 7\n66. 1, 5, 8\n67. 1, 5, 9\n68. 1, 6, 7\n69. 1, 6, 8\n70. 1, 6, 9\n71. 1, 7, 8\n72. 1, 7, 9\n73. 1, 8, 9\n74. 2, 3, 4\n75. 2, 3, 5\n76. 2, 3, 6\n77. 2, 3, 7\n78. 2, 3, 8\n79. 2, 3, 9\n80. 2, 4, 5\n81. 2, 4, 6\n82. 2, 4, 7\n83. 2, 4, 8\n84. 2, 4, 9\n85. 2, 5, 6\n86. 2, 5, 7\n87. 2, 5, 8\n88. 2, 5, 9\n89. 2, 6, 7\n90. 2, 6, 8\n91. 2, 6, 9\n92. 2, 7, 8\n93. 2, 7, 9\n94. 2, 8, 9\n95. 3, 4, 5\n96. 3, 4, 6\n97. 3, 4, 7\n98. 3, 4, 8\n99. 3, 4, 9\n100. 3, 5, 6\n101. 3, 5, 7\n102. 3, 5, 8\n103. 3, 5, 9\n104. 3, 6, 7\n105. 3, 6, 8\n106. 3, 6, 9\n107. 3, 7, 8\n108. 3, 7, 9\n109. 3, 8, 9\n110. 4, 5, 6\n111. 4, 5, 7\n112. 4, 5, 8\n113. 4, 5, 9\n114. 4, 6, 7\n115. 4, 6, 8\n116. 4, 6, 9\n117. 4, 7, 8\n118. 4, 7, 9\n119. 4, 8, 9\n120. 5, 6, 7\n121. 5, 6, 8\n122. 5, 6, 9\n123. 5, 7, 8\n124. 5, 7, 9\n125. 5, 8, 9\n126. 6, 7, 8\n127. 6, 7, 9\n128. 6, 8, 9\n129. 7, 8, 9\n130. 1, 2, 3, 4\n131. 1, 2, 3, 5\n132. 1, 2, 3, 6\n133. 1, 2, 3, 7\n134. 1, 2, 3, 8\n135. 1, 2, 3, 9\n136. 1, 2, 4, 5\n137. 1, 2, 4, 6\n138. 1, 2, 4, 7\n139. 1, 2, 4, 8\n140. 1, 2, 4, 9\n141. 1, 2, 5, 6\n142. 1, 2, 5, 7\n143. 1, 2, 5, 8\n144. 1, 2, 5, 9\n145. 1, 2, 6, 7\n146. 1, 2, 6, 8\n147. 1, 2, 6, 9\n148. 1, 2, 7, 8\n149. 1, 2, 7, 9\n150. 1, 2, 8, 9\n151. 1, 3, 4, 5\n152. 1, 3, 4, 6\n153. 1, 3, 4, 7\n154. 1, 3, 4, 8\n155. 1, 3, 4, 9\n156. 1, 3, 5, 6\n157. 1, 3, 5, 7\n158. 1, 3, 5, 8\n159. 1, 3, 5, 9\n160. 1, 3, 6, 7\n161. 1, 3, 6, 8\n162. 1, 3, 6, 9\n163. 1, 3, 7, 8\n164. 1, 3, 7, 9\n165. 1, 3, 8, 9\n166. 1, 4, 5, 6\n167. 1, 4, 5, 7\n168. 1, 4, 5, 8\n169. 1, 4, 5, 9\n170. 1, 4, 6, 7\n171. 1, 4, 6, 8\n172. 1, 4, 6, 9\n173. 1, 4, 7, 8\n174. 1, 4, 7, 9\n175. 1, 4, 8, 9\n176. 1, 5, 6, 7\n177. 1, 5, 6, 8\n178. 1, 5, 6, 9\n179. 1, 5, 7, 8\n180. 1, 5, 7, 9\n181. 1, 5, 8, 9\n182. 1, 6, 7, 8\n183. 1, 6, 7, 9\n184. 1, 6, 8, 9\n185. 1, 7, 8, 9\n186. 2, 3, 4, 5\n187. 2, 3, 4, 6\n188. 2, 3, 4, 7\n189. 2, 3, 4, 8\n190. 2, 3, 4, 9\n191. 2, 3, 5, 6\n192. 2, 3, 5, 7\n193. 2, 3, 5, 8\n194. 2, 3, 5, 9\n195. 2, 3, 6, 7\n196. 2, 3, 6, 8\n197. 2, 3, 6, 9\n198. 2, 3, 7, 8\n199. 2, 3, 7, 9\n200. 2, 3, 8, 9\n201. 2, 4, 5, 6\n202. 2, 4, 5, 7\n203. 2, 4, 5, 8\n204. 2, 4, 5, 9\n205. 2, 4, 6, 7\n206. 2, 4, 6, 8\n207. 2, 4, 6, 9\n208. 2, 4, 7, 8\n209. 2, 4, 7, 9\n210. 2, 4, 8, 9\n211. 2, 5, 6, 7\n212. 2, 5, 6, 8\n213. 2, 5, 6, 9\n214. 2, 5, 7, 8\n215. 2, 5, 7, 9\n216. 2, 5, 8, 9\n217. 2, 6, 7, 8\n218. 2, 6, 7, 9\n219. 2, 6, 8, 9\n220. 2, 7, 8, 9\n221. 3, 4, 5, 6\n222. 3, 4, 5, 7\n223. 3, 4, 5, 8\n224. 3, 4, 5, 9\n225. 3, 4, 6, 7\n226. 3, 4, 6, 8\n227. 3, 4, 6, 9\n228. 3, 4, 7, 8\n229. 3, 4, 7, 9\n230. 3, 4, 8, 9\n231. 3, 5, 6, 7\n232. 3, 5, 6, 8\n233. 3, 5, 6, 9\n234. 3, 5, 7, 8\n235. 3, 5, 7, 9\n236. 3, 5, 8, 9\n237. 3, 6, 7, 8\n238. 3, 6, 7, 9\n239. 3, 6, 8, 9\n240. 3, 7, 8, 9\n241. 4, 5, 6, 7\n242. 4, 5, 6, 8\n243. 4, 5, 6, 9\n244. 4, 5, 7, 8\n245. 4, 5, 7, 9\n246. 4, 5, 8, 9\n247. 4, 6, 7, 8\n248. 4, 6, 7, 9\n249. 4, 6, 8, 9\n250. 4, 7, 8, 9\n251. 5, 6, 7, 8\n252. 5, 6, 7, 9\n253. 5, 6, 8, 9\n254. 5, 7, 8, 9\n255. 6, 7, 8, 9\n256. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5\n257. 1, 2, 3, 4, 6\n258. 1, 2, 3, 4, 7\n259. 1, 2, 3, 4, 8\n260. 1, 2, 3, 4, 9\n261. 1, 2, 3, 5, 6\n262. 1, 2,"], "id": 2011, "generated_answers": [""], "gold_answer": "$2 n^{2}-2 n+1$", "is_correct": false, "answers_correctness": [false]}

We want to find all $t$ such that for each positive integer $n$, there exists a good collection of $n$ triangles, each of perimeter greater than $t$.\n\nLet $P$ be the perimeter of a triangle inscribed in a circle of radius 1. Then $P = a+b+c$, where $a, b, c$ are the side lengths of the triangle. By the Law of Cosines, $a^2 = b^2+c^2-2bc\\cos A$, $b^2 = a^2+c^2-2ac\\cos B$, $c^2 = a^2+b^2-2ab\\cos C$. Also, $A+B+C = \\pi$.\nWe have $P = a+b+c$. We want to find the maximum value of $P$.\nLet $a=2\\sin A$, $b=2\\sin B$, $c=2\\sin C$.

We want to find the smallest integer $k$ such that for any real numbers $a_1, \\ldots, a_d$ with $a_1 + \\cdots + a_d = n$ and $0 \\le a_i \\le 1$ for all $i$, we can partition these numbers into $k$ groups such that the sum of the numbers in each group is at most 1.\n\nFirst, we show that $k = n$ is sufficient. Let $a_1, \\ldots, a_d$ be real numbers such that $a_1 + \\cdots + a_d = n$ and $0 \\le a_i \\le 1$ for all $i$. We want to partition these numbers into $n$ groups such that the sum of the numbers in each group is at most 1. We can do this by sorting the numbers in non-decreasing order, i.e., $a_1 \\le a_2 \\le \\cdots \\le a_d$. Then, we can form the groups as follows:\n\\begin{itemize}\n    \\item Group 1: $a_1$\n    \\item Group 2: $a_2$\n    \\item \\vdots\n    \\item Group $n$: $a_n$\n\\end{itemize}\nSince $a_i \\le 1$ for all $i$, the sum of the numbers in each group is at most 1. If $d < n$, we can add $n-d$ groups with sum 0.\n\nNow, we show that $k = n-1$ is not sufficient. Consider the case where $a_1 = a_2 = \\cdots = a_{n-1} = 1$ and $a_n = n - (n-1) = 1$. Then $a_1 + \\cdots + a_n = n$. If we partition these numbers into $n-1$ groups, then at least one group must contain at least two numbers. The sum of the numbers in that group is at least $1+1=2$, which is greater than 1. Therefore, $k = n-1$ is not sufficient.\n\nThus, the smallest integer $k$ with the given property is $k = n$.\n\nFinal Answer: The final answer is $\\boxed{n}$"], "id": 2063, "generated_answers": ["n"], "gold_answer": "$k=2 n-1$", "is_correct": false, "answers_correctness": [false]}

Then $B = \\frac{n^2+1}{2}$ and $W = \\frac{n^2-1}{2}$.\nSince the limp rook must make a turn at each move, it must alternate between black and white squares. Thus, the number of squares in the route must be even.\nLet $R$ be the number of squares in the route. Then $R$ must be even.\nThe longest possible cyclic, non-intersecting route of a limp rook visits $R$ squares.\nThe limp rook can move to any adjacent square, and every move must be a turn.\nThe board is $999 \\times 999$, so $n=999$.\nThe number of black squares is $B = \\frac{999^2+1}{2} = \\frac{998001+1}{2} = \\frac{998002}{2} = 499001$.\nThe number of white squares is $W = \\frac{999^2-1}{2} = \\frac{998001-1}{2} = \\frac{998000}{2} = 499000$.\nThe total number of squares is $n^2 = 999^2 = 998001$.\nThe longest possible cyclic, non-intersecting route of a limp rook visits $R$

We are given the equation\n$$x^3(y^3+z^3) = 2012(xyz+2).$$\nSince $x, y, z$ are positive integers, $x^3(y^3+z^3)$ is a positive integer. Thus, $2012(xyz+2)$ is a positive integer, which implies $xyz+2$ is a positive integer. Since $x, y, z$ are positive integers, $xyz$ is a positive integer, so $xyz+2$ is a positive integer.\n\nWe have $x^3(y^3+z^3) = 2012(xyz+2)$. Since $x, y, z$ are positive integers, $x^3(y^3+z^3)$ is divisible by $x^3$. Thus, $2012(xyz+2)$ is divisible by $x^3$. Since $2012 = 2^2 \\cdot 503$, we have $2^2 \\cdot 503(xyz+2)$ is divisible by $x^3$. This implies that $x^3$ divides $2^2 \\cdot 503(xyz+2)$.\n\nIf $x=1$, then $y^3+z^3 = 2012(yz+2)$. Since $y \\leq z$, $y^3+z^3 \\leq 2z^3$. Also, $2012(yz+2) \\geq 2012(1+2) = 6036$. Thus, $2z^3 \\geq 6036$, so $z^3 \\geq 3018$, which means $z \\geq \\sqrt[3]{3018} \\approx 14.4$. Since $y \\leq z$, $y \\geq 1$ and $z \\geq 14$.\n\nIf $x=2$, then $8(y^3+z^3) = 2012(2yz+2) = 4024(yz+1)$. Dividing by 8, we get $y^3+z^3 = 503(yz+1)$. Since $y \\leq z$, $y^3+z^3 \\leq 2z^3$. Also, $503(yz+1) \\geq 503(1+1) = 1006$. Thus, $2z^3 \\geq 1006$, so $z^3 \\geq 503$, which means $z \\geq \\sqrt[3]{503} \\approx 7.9$. Since $y \\leq z$, $y \\geq 1$ and $z \\geq 8$.\n\nIf $x=3$, then $27(y^3+z^3) = 2012(3yz+2)$. Dividing by 27, we get $y^3+z^3 = \\frac{2012}{27}(3yz+2)$. Since $y^3+z^3$ is an integer, $\\frac{2012}{27}(3yz+2)$ must be an integer. This implies that $27$ divides $2012(3yz+2)$. Since $27$ does not divide $2012$, $27$ must divide $3yz+2$. This is impossible since $3yz+2 \\equiv 2 \\pmod{3}$, so $3yz+2$ is not divisible by $3$.\n\nIf $x=4$, then $64(y^3+z^3) = 2012(4yz+2) = 8048(yz+1)$. Dividing by 64, we get $y^3+z^3 = \\frac{8048}{64}(yz+1) = 125.75(yz+1)$. Since $y^3+z^3$ is an integer, $125.75(yz+1)$ must be an integer. This is impossible since $125.75$ is not an integer.\n\nIf $x=5$, then $125(y^3+z^3) = 2012(5yz+2)$. Dividing by 125, we get $y^3+z^3 = \\frac{2012}{125}(5yz+2)$. Since $y^3+z^3$ is an integer, $\\frac{2012}{125}(5yz+2)$ must be an integer. This implies that $125$ divides $2012(5yz+2)$. Since $125$ does not divide $2012$, $125$ must divide $5yz+2$. This is impossible since $5yz+2 \\equiv 2 \\pmod{5}$, so $5yz+2$ is not divisible by $5$.\n\nIf $x=6$, then $216(y^3+z^3) = 2012(6yz+2) = 12072(yz+1)$. Dividing by 216, we get $y^3+z^3 = \\frac{12072}{216}(yz+1) = 55.8333(yz+1)$. Since $y^3+z^3$ is an integer, $55.8333(yz+1)$ must be an integer.

Since $y^3+z^3$ is an integer, $\\frac{2012}{343}(7yz+2)$ must be an integer. This implies that $343$ divides $2012(7yz+2)$. Since $343$ does not divide $2012$, $343$ must divide $7yz+2$. This is impossible since $7yz+2 \\equiv 2 \\pmod{7}$, so $7yz+2$ is not divisible by $7$.\n\nIf $x=8$, then $512(y^3+z^3) = 2012(8yz+2) = 16096(yz+1)$. Dividing by 512, we get $y^3+z^3 = \\frac{16096}{512}(yz+1) = 31.4(yz+1)$. Since $y^3+z^3$ is an integer, $31.4(yz+1)$ must be an integer.

Since $y^3+z^3$ is an integer, $\\frac{2012}{729}(9yz+2)$ must be an integer. This implies that $729$ divides $2012(9yz+2)$. Since $729$ does not divide $2012$, $729$ must divide $9yz+2$.

Since $y^3+z^3$ is an integer, $\\frac{2012}{1331}(11yz+2)$ must be an integer. This implies that $1331$ divides $2012(11yz+2)$. Since $1331$ does not divide $2012$, $1331$ must divide $11yz+2$. This is impossible since $11yz+2 \\equiv 2 \\pmod{11}$, so $11yz+2$ is not divisible by $11$.\n\nIf $x=12$, then $1728(y^3+z^3) = 2012(12yz+2) = 24144(yz+1)$. Dividing by 1728, we get $y^3+z^3 = \\frac{24144}{1728}(yz+1) = 13.9333(yz+1)$. Since $y^3+z^3$ is an integer, $13.9333(yz+1)$ must be an integer.

Since $y^3+z^3$ is an integer, $\\frac{2012}{2197}(13yz+2)$ must be an integer. This implies that $2197$ divides $2012(13yz+2)$. Since $2197$ does not divide $2012$, $2197$ must divide $13yz+2$. This is impossible since $13yz+2 \\equiv 2 \\pmod{13}$, so $13yz+2$ is not divisible by $13$.\n\nIf $x=14$, then $2744(y^3+z^3) = 2012(14yz+2) = 28168(yz+1)$. Dividing by 2744, we get $y^3+z^3 = \\frac{28168}{2744}(yz+1) = 10.238(yz+1)$. Since $y^3+z^3$ is an integer, $10.238(yz+1)$ must be an integer.

Since $A, B, C$ partition $S$, the sum of the elements in $A, B, C$ must be $\\frac{n(n+1)}{6}$.\nSince $A$ contains only odd numbers, the sum of the elements in $A$ is odd.\nSince $B$ contains only even numbers, the sum of the elements in $B$ is even.\nSince $C$ contains every multiple of 3, the sum of the elements in $C$ is $\\sum_{i=1}^{\\lfloor \\frac{n}{3} \\rfloor} 3i = 3 \\sum_{i=1}^{\\lfloor \\frac{n}{3} \\rfloor} i = 3 \\frac{\\lfloor \\frac{n}{3} \\rfloor (\\lfloor \\frac{n}{3} \\rfloor + 1)}{2}$.\nSince the sum of the elements in $A, B, C$ is $\\frac{n(n+1)}{6}$, we have\n$\\frac{n(n+1)}{6} = \\text{odd} + \\text{even} + 3 \\frac{\\lfloor \\frac{n}{3} \\rfloor (\\lfloor \\frac{n}{3} \\rfloor + 1)}{2}$.\nSince $\\text{odd} + \\text{even} = \\text{odd}$, we have $\\frac{n(n+1)}{6} = \\text{odd} + 3 \\frac{\\lfloor \\frac{n}{3} \\rfloor (\\lfloor \\frac{n}{3} \\rfloor + 1)}{2}$.\nSince $3 \\frac{\\lfloor \\frac{n}{3} \\rfloor (\\lfloor \\frac{n}{3} \\rfloor + 1)}{2}$ is always even, we have $\\frac{n(n+1)}{6} = \\text{odd} + \\text{even} = \\text{odd}$.\nThus, $\\frac{n(n+1)}{6}$ is odd, so $n(n+1)$ is divisible by 6 and $n(n+1)$ is divisible by 2.\nSince $n(n+1)$ is divisible by 2, $n$ or $n+1$ is even, so $n$ is even or $n$ is odd.\nIf $n$ is even, then $n+1$ is odd. Since $n(n+1)$ is divisible by 6, $n$ must be divisible by 3.\nIf $n$ is odd, then $n+1$ is even. Since $n(n+1)$ is divisible by 6, $n+1$ must be divisible by 3.\nIf $n$ is even, then $n = 2k$ for some integer $k$. Then $n(n+1) = 2k(2k+1)$. Since $n(n+1)$ is divisible by 6, $2k(2k+1)$ is divisible by 6.\nSince $2k$ is divisible by 2, $2k+1$ is odd. Thus, $2k(2k+1)$ is divisible by 2.\nFor $2k(2k+1)$ to be divisible by 3, $2k+1$ must be divisible by 3, so $2k+1 = 3m$ for some integer $m$.\nThen $2k = 3m-1$, so $k = \\frac{3m-1}{2}$. Since $k$ is an integer, $3m-1$ must be even, so $m$ must be odd.\nLet $m = 2j+1$ for some integer $j$. Then $k = \\frac{3(2j+1)-1}{2} = \\frac{6j+3-1}{2} = \\frac{6j+2}{2} = 3j+1$.\nThen $n = 2k = 2(3j+1) = 6j+2$.\nIf $n$ is odd, then $n = 2k+1$ for some integer $k$. Then $n(n+1) = (2k+1)(2k+2) = (2k+1)2(k+1) = 2(2k+1)(k+1)$. Since $n(n+1)$ is divisible by 6, $2(2k+1)(k+1)$ is divisible by 6.\nSince $2(2k+1)(k+1)$ is divisible by 2, we need $(2k+1)(k+1)$ to be divisible by 3.\nIf $2k+1$ is divisible by 3, then $2k+1 = 3m$ for some integer $m$. Then $2k = 3m-1$, so $k = \\frac{3m-1}{2}$. Since $k$ is an integer, $3m-1$ must be even, so $m$ must be odd.\nLet $m = 2j+1$ for some integer $j$. Then $k = \\frac{3(2j+1)-1}{2} = \\frac{6j+3-1}{2} = \\frac{6j+2}{2} = 3j+1$.\nThen $n = 2k+1 = 2(3j+1)+1 = 6j+3$.\nIf $k+1$ is divisible by 3, then $k+1 = 3m$ for some integer $m$. Then $k = 3m-1$.\nThen $n = 2k+1 = 2(3m-1)+1 = 6m-2+1 = 6m-1$.\nIf $n$ is even, then $n = 6j+2$ for some integer $j$. Then $n < 100$, so $6j+2 < 100$, which means $6j < 98$, so $j < \\frac{98}{6} = \\frac{49}{3} = 16.333\\dots$.\nThus, $j$ can be any integer from 0 to 16.\nIf $n$ is odd, then $n = 6j+3$ or $n = 6j-1$ for some integer $j$. Then $n < 100$, so $6j+3 < 100$, which means $6j < 97$, so $j < \\frac{97}{6} = 16.166\\dots$.\nAlso, $6j-1 < 100$, so $6j < 101$, so $j < \\frac{101}{6} = 16.833\\dots$.\nThus, $j$ can be any integer from 0 to 16.\nThe even savage integers less than 100 are $6j+2$ for $j=0,1,\\dots,16$.\n$2, 8, 14, 20, 26, 32, 38, 44, 50, 56, 62, 68, 74, 80, 86, 92, 98$.\nThe odd savage integers less than 100 are $6j+3$ and $6j-1$ for $j=0,1,\\dots,16$.\n$3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15, 17, 19, 21, 23, 25, 27, 29, 31, 33, 35, 37, 39, 41, 43, 45, 47, 49, 51, 53, 55, 57, 59, 61, 63, 65, 67, 69, 71, 73, 75, 77, 79, 81, 83, 85, 87, 89, 91, 93, 95, 97$.\nThe even savage integers less than 100 are $2, 8, 14, 20, 26, 32, 38, 44, 50, 56, 62, 68, 74, 80, 86, 92, 98$.\n\nFinal Answer: The final answer is $\\boxed{2, 8, 14, 20, 26, 32, 38, 44, 50, 56, 62, 68, 74, 80, 86, 92, 98}$"], "id": 2453, "generated_answers": ["2, 8, 14, 20, 26, 32, 38, 44, 50, 56, 62, 68, 74, 80, 86, 92, 98"], "gold_answer": "8,32,44,68,80", "is_correct": false, "answers_correctness": [false]}

Then $14^{j-1} \\le N < 14^j$.\nSince $N$ is a palindrome in base 20, we can write $N = \\sum_{i=0}^{k-1} a_i 20^i$, where $a_i \\in \\{0, 1, \\dots, 19\\}$ and $a_0 \\neq 0$.

In base 14, $N$ is a 6-digit number, so $14^5 \\le N < 14^6$, so $537824 \\le N < 7529536$.\nWe want to find the least integer $N$ such that $N$ is a palindrome in both base 20 and base 14.\nIf $N$ is a 2-digit number in base 20, then $N = a_0 + a_1 20$. Since $N$ is a palindrome, $a_0 = a_1$. Thus, $N = a_0 (1+20) = 21a_0$. Since $20 \\le N < 400$, we have $20 \\le 21a_0 < 400$, so $\\frac{20}{21} \\le a_0 < \\frac{400}{21}$. Thus, $0.95 \\le a_0 < 19.05$. Since $a_0 \\neq 0$, we have $1 \\le a_0 \\le 19$. Then $N = 21a_0$. In base 14, $N = b_0 + b_1 14$. Since $N$ is a palindrome, $b_0 = b_1$. Thus, $N = b_0 (1+14) = 15b_0$. Since $14 \\le N < 196$, we have $14 \\le 15b_0 < 196$, so $\\frac{14}{15} \\le b_0 < \\frac{196}{15}$. Thus, $0.93 \\le b_0 < 13.07$. Since $b_0 \\neq 0$, we have $1 \\le b_0 \\le 13$. Then $N = 15b_0$.\nWe want $21a_0 = 15b_0$, so $7a_0 = 5b_0$. Since $1 \\le a_0 \\le 19$ and $1 \\le b_0 \\le 13$, we have $7 \\le 7a_0 \\le 133$ and $5 \\le 5b_0 \\le 65$. Thus, $7a_0 = 5b_0$ has no solution.\nIf $N$ is a 3-digit number in base 20, then $N = a_0 + a_1 20 + a_2 20^2$. Since $N$ is a palindrome, $a_0 = a_2$. Thus, $N = a_0 (1+20+400) = 421a_0$. Since $400 \\le N < 8000$, we have $400 \\le 421a_0 < 8000$, so $\\frac{400}{421} \\le a_0 < \\frac{8000}{421}$. Thus, $0.95 \\le a_0 < 19.00$. Since $a_0 \\neq 0$, we have $1 \\le a_0 \\le 19$. Then $N = 421a_0$. In base 14, $N = b_0 + b_1 14 + b_2 14^2$. Since $N$ is a palindrome, $b_0 = b_2$. Thus, $N = b_0 (1+14+196) = 211b_0$.

Thus, $421a_0 = 211b_0$ has no solution.\nIf $N$ is a 4-digit number in base 20, then $N = a_0 + a_1 20 + a_2 20^2 + a_3 20^3$. Since $N$ is a palindrome, $a_0 = a_3$ and $a_1 = a_2$. Thus, $N = a_0 (1+20^3) + a_1 (20+20^2) = a_0 (1+8000) + a_1 (20+400) = 8001a_0 + 420a_1$. Since $20^3 \\le N < 20^4$, we have $8000 \\le N < 160000$. In base 14, $N = b_0 + b_1 14 + b_2 14^2 + b_3 14^3$. Since $N$ is a palindrome, $b_0 = b_3$ and $b_1 = b_2$. Thus, $N = b_0 (1+14^3) + b_1 (14+14^2) = b_0 (1+2744) + b_1 (14+196) = 2745b_0 + 210b_1$. Since $14^3 \\le N < 14^4$, we have $2744 \\le N < 38416$.\nWe want $8001a_0 + 420a_1 = 2745b_0 + 210b_1$. We can try $a_0 = 1$, $a_1 = 1$, $b_0 = 1$, $b_1 = 1$. Then $8001+420 = 2745+210$, so $8421 = 2955$, which is false.\nIf $a_0 = 1$, $a_1 = 1$, $b_0 = 2$, $b_1 = 2$.

We want to find the number of distinguishable resident cycles of length 6.\n\nA resident cycle of length 6 is a sequence of 6 distinct residents $r_1, \\dots, r_6$ such that for each $1 \\le i \\le 5$, $r_i$ and $r_{i+1}$ know how to make a common dish, and $r_6$ and $r_1$ know how to make a common dish. Also, no other pair of residents $r_i$ and $r_j$ know how to make a common dish.\n\nLet $r_1, \\dots, r_6$ be a resident cycle. Then $r_1$ and $r_2$ know how to make a common dish, say $D_{i_1}$. $r_2$ and $r_3$ know how to make a common dish, say $D_{i_2}$. $r_3$ and $r_4$ know how to make a common dish, say $D_{i_3}$. $r_4$ and $r_5$ know how to make a common dish, say $D_{i_4}$. $r_5$ and $r_6$ know how to make a common dish, say $D_{i_5}$. $r_6$ and $r_1$ know how to make a common dish, say $D_{i_6}$.\n\nSince $r_1$ and $r_2$ know how to make $D_{i_1}$, $r_1$ and $r_2$ are $D_{i_1}$-chefs. Since $r_2$ and $r_3$ know how to make $D_{i_2}$, $r_2$ and $r_3$ are $D_{i_2}$-chefs. Since $r_3$ and $r_4$ know how to make $D_{i_3}$, $r_3$ and $r_4$ are $D_{i_3}$-chefs. Since $r_4$ and $r_5$ know how to make $D_{i_4}$, $r_4$ and $r_5$ are $D_{i_4}$-chefs. Since $r_5$ and $r_6$ know how to make $D_{i_5}$, $r_5$ and $r_6$ are $D_{i_5}$-chefs. Since $r_6$ and $r_1$ know how to make $D_{i_6}$, $r_6$ and $r_1$ are $D_{i_6}$-chefs.\n\nSince $r_1, \\dots, r_6$ are distinct, $D_{i_1}, \\dots, D_{i_6}$ are distinct. Also, $r_1$ and $r_2$ know how to make $D_{i_1}$, $r_2$ and $r_3$ know how to make $D_{i_2}$, $r_3$ and $r_4$ know how to make $D_{i_3}$, $r_4$ and $r_5$ know how to make $D_{i_4}$, $r_5$ and $r_6$ know how to make $D_{i_5}$, $r_6$ and $r_1$ know how to make $D_{i_6}$.\n\nWe want to find the number of ways to choose 6 distinct dishes $D_{i_1}, \\dots, D_{i_6}$ from the 8 dishes. This is $\\binom{8}{6} = \\frac{8 \\times 7}{2} = 28$.\n\nHowever, we need to consider the order of the dishes. Since $r_1, \\dots, r_6$ are distinct, we can arrange them in $6!$ ways. But we need to divide by 6 because we can rotate the cycle, and by 2 because we can reverse the cycle. So we have $\\frac{6!}{6 \\times 2} = \\frac{720}{12} = 60$.\n\nThe number of distinguishable resident cycles of length 6 in $\\mathcal{F}_8$ is $\\binom{8}{6} \\times \\frac{6!}{6 \\times 2} = 28 \\times 60 = 1680$.\n\nFinal Answer: The final answer is $\\boxed{1680}$"], "id": 2625, "generated_answers": ["1680"], "gold_answer": "1680", "is_correct": true, "answers_correctness": [true]}
{"question": "In each town in ARMLandia, the residents have formed groups, which meet each week to share math problems and enjoy each others' company over a potluck-style dinner. Each town resident belongs to exactly one group. Every week, each resident is required to make one dish and to bring it to his/her group.\n\nIt so happens that each resident knows how to make precisely two dishes. Moreover, no two residents of a town know how to make the same pair of dishes. Shown below are two example towns. In the left column are the names of the town's residents. Adjacent to each name is the list of dishes that the corresponding resident knows how to make.\n\n| ARMLton |  |\n| :--- | :--- |\n| Resident | Dishes |\n| Paul | pie, turkey |\n| Arnold | pie, salad |\n| Kelly | salad, broth |\n\n\n| ARMLville |  |\n| :--- | :--- |\n| Resident | Dishes |\n| Sally | steak, calzones |\n| Ross | calzones, pancakes |\n| David | steak, pancakes |\n\nThe population of a town $T$, denoted $\\operatorname{pop}(T)$, is the number of residents of $T$. Formally, the town itself is simply the set of its residents, denoted by $\\left\\{r_{1}, \\ldots, r_{\\mathrm{pop}(T)}\\right\\}$ unless otherwise specified. The set of dishes that the residents of $T$ collectively know how to make is denoted $\\operatorname{dish}(T)$. For example, in the town of ARMLton described above, pop(ARMLton) $=3$, and dish(ARMLton) $=$ \\{pie, turkey, salad, broth\\}.\n\nA town $T$ is called full if for every pair of dishes in $\\operatorname{dish}(T)$, there is exactly one resident in $T$ who knows how to make those two dishes. In the examples above, ARMLville is a full town, but ARMLton is not, because (for example) nobody in ARMLton knows how to make both turkey and salad.\n\nDenote by $\\mathcal{F}_{d}$ a full town in which collectively the residents know how to make $d$ dishes. That is, $\\left|\\operatorname{dish}\\left(\\mathcal{F}_{d}\\right)\\right|=d$.\n\nIn order to avoid the embarrassing situation where two people bring the same dish to a group dinner, if two people know how to make a common dish, they are forbidden from participating in the same group meeting. Formally, a group assignment on $T$ is a function $f: T \\rightarrow\\{1,2, \\ldots, k\\}$, satisfying the condition that if $f\\left(r_{i}\\right)=f\\left(r_{j}\\right)$ for $i \\neq j$, then $r_{i}$ and $r_{j}$ do not know any of the same recipes. The group number of a town $T$, denoted $\\operatorname{gr}(T)$, is the least positive integer $k$ for which there exists a group assignment on $T$.\n\nFor example, consider once again the town of ARMLton. A valid group assignment would be $f($ Paul $)=f($ Kelly $)=1$ and $f($ Arnold $)=2$. The function which gives the value 1 to each resident of ARMLton is not a group assignment, because Paul and Arnold must be assigned to different groups.\n\n\nFor a dish $D$, a resident is called a $D$-chef if he or she knows how to make the dish $D$. Define $\\operatorname{chef}_{T}(D)$ to be the set of residents in $T$ who are $D$-chefs. For example, in ARMLville, David is a steak-chef and a pancakes-chef. Further, $\\operatorname{chef}_{\\text {ARMLville }}($ steak $)=\\{$ Sally, David $\\}$.\n\n\nIf $\\operatorname{gr}(T)=\\left|\\operatorname{chef}_{T}(D)\\right|$ for some $D \\in \\operatorname{dish}(T)$, then $T$ is called homogeneous. If $\\operatorname{gr}(T)>\\left|\\operatorname{chef}_{T}(D)\\right|$ for each dish $D \\in \\operatorname{dish}(T)$, then $T$ is called heterogeneous. For example, ARMLton is homogeneous, because $\\operatorname{gr}($ ARMLton $)=2$ and exactly two chefs make pie, but ARMLville is heterogeneous, because even though each dish is only cooked by two chefs, $\\operatorname{gr}($ ARMLville $)=3$.\n\n\nA resident cycle is a sequence of distinct residents $r_{1}, \\ldots, r_{n}$ such that for each $1 \\leq i \\leq n-1$, the residents $r_{i}$ and $r_{i+1}$ know how to make a common dish, residents $r_{n}$ and $r_{1}$ know how to make a common dish, and no other pair of residents $r_{i}$ and $r_{j}, 1 \\leq i, j \\leq n$ know how to make a common dish. Two resident cycles are indistinguishable if they contain the same residents (in any order), and distinguishable otherwise. For example, if $r_{1}, r_{2}, r_{3}, r_{4}$ is a resident cycle, then $r_{2}, r_{1}, r_{4}, r_{3}$ and $r_{3}, r_{2}, r_{1}, r_{4}$ are indistinguishable resident cycles.\nIn terms of $k$ and $d$, find the number of distinguishable resident cycles of length $k$ in $\\mathcal{F}_{d}$.", "generated_responses": ["Let $T$ be a full town with $d$ dishes.

Let $dy^2 - 14 = k$, where $k$ is a divisor of $d^2 + 14$. Then $dy^2 = k + 14$, so $y^2 = \\frac{k + 14}{d}$. Since $y^2$ is an integer, $d$ must divide $k + 14$. Also, $y = \\frac{\\sqrt{k + 14}}{\\sqrt{d}}$, so $k + 14$ must be a perfect square.\nLet $k + 14 = m^2$, where $m$ is an integer. Then $k = m^2 - 14$. Since $k$ is a divisor of $d^2 + 14$, we have $d^2 + 14 = n(m^2 - 14)$ for some integer $n$. Then $d^2 = n(m^2 - 14) - 14$.\nAlso, $y^2 = \\frac{m^2}{d}$, so $y = \\frac{m}{\\sqrt{d}}$. Since $y$ is an integer, $d$ must be a perfect square.\nLet $d = p^2$. Then $y^2 = \\frac{m^2}{p^2}$, so $y = \\frac{m}{p}$. Since $y$ is an integer, $p$ must divide $m$.\nLet $m = pq$. Then $y = q$. Also, $d = p^2$, so $k = p^2 q^2 - 14$. Since $k$ is a divisor of $d^2 + 14 = p^4 + 14$, we have $p^4 + 14 = n(p^2 q^2 - 14)$ for some integer $n$.\n$p^4 + 14 = np^2 q^2 - 14n$\n$p^4 - np^2 q^2 + 14n + 14 = 0$\n$p^2(p^2 - nq^2) = -14n - 14$\n$p^2(p^2 - nq^2) = -14(n + 1)$\nSince $p^2$ is a perfect square, $p^2 - nq^2$ must be an integer. Also, $p^2(p^2 - nq^2) = -14(n + 1)$.\nIf $p = 1$, then $1 - nq^2 = -14(n + 1)$, so $1 - nq^2 = -14n - 14$, which gives $nq^2 - 14n = 15$, so $n(q^2 - 14) = 15$. Then $n$ must be a divisor of 15, so $n \\in \\{1, 3, 5, 15\\}$.\nIf $n = 1$, then $q^2 - 14 = 15$, so $q^2 = 29$, which is not a perfect square.\nIf $n = 3$, then $q^2 - 14 = 5$, so $q^2 = 19$, which is not a perfect square.\nIf $n = 5$, then $q^2 - 14 = 3$, so $q^2 = 17$, which is not a perfect square.\nIf $n = 15$, then $q^2 - 14 = 1$, so $q^2 = 15$, which is not a perfect square.\nIf $p = 2$, then $4 - 4nq^2 = -14(n + 1)$, so $4 - 4nq^2 = -14n - 14$, which gives $4nq^2 - 14n = 18$, so $2nq^2 - 7n = 9$, which gives $n(2q^2 - 7) = 9$. Then $n$ must be a divisor of 9, so $n \\in \\{1, 3, 9\\}$.\nIf $n = 1$, then $2q^2 - 7 = 9$, so $2q^2 = 16$, $q^2 = 8$, which is not a perfect square.\nIf $n = 3$, then $2q^2 - 7 = 3$, so $2q^2 = 10$, $q^2 = 5$, which is not a perfect square.\nIf $n = 9$, then $2q^2 - 7 = 1$, so $2q^2 = 8$, $q^2 = 4$, so $q = 2$. Then $y = 2$, $d = 4$, $k = 4(4) - 14 = 16 - 14 = 2$. Then $y^3 - z = 2$, so $8 - z = 2$, $z = 6$. Then $x = \\frac{6^2 + 14}{2} = \\frac{36 + 14}{2} = \\frac{50}{2} = 25$.\n$x = 25, y = 2, z = 6$. $xy - z^2 = 25(2) - 6^2 = 50 - 36 = 14$. $y^2 z - x = 2^2(6) - 25 = 4(6) - 25 = 24 - 25 = -1$.\nIf $p = 3$, then $9 - 9nq^2 = -14(n + 1)$, so $9 - 9nq^2 = -14n - 14$, which gives $9nq^2 - 14n = 23$, so $n(9q^2 - 14) = 23$. Then $n$ must be a divisor of 23, so $n \\in \\{1, 23\\}$.\nIf $n = 1$, then $9q^2 - 14 = 23$, so $9q^2 = 37$, which is not a perfect square.\nIf $n = 23$, then $9q^2 - 14 = 1$, so $9q^2 = 15$, which is not a perfect square.\nIf $p = 4$, then $16 - 16nq^2 = -14(n + 1)$, so $16 - 16nq^2 = -14n - 14$, which gives $16nq^2 - 14n = 30$, so $2n(8q^2 - 7) = 30$, so $n(8q^2 - 7) = 15$. Then $n$ must be a divisor of 15, so $n \\in \\{1, 3, 5, 15\\}$.\nIf $n = 1$, then $8q^2 - 7 = 15$, so $8q^2 = 22$, which is not a perfect square.\nIf $n = 3$, then $8q^2 - 7 = 5$, so $8q^2 = 12$, which is not a perfect square.\nIf $n = 5$, then $8q^2 - 7 = 3$, so $8q^2 = 10$, which is not a perfect square.\nIf $n = 15$, then $8q^2 - 7 = 1$, so $8q^2 = 8$, $q^2 = 1$, so $q = 1$. Then $y = 1$, $d = 1$, $k = 1(1) - 14 = -13$. Then $y^3 - z = -13$, so $1 - z = -13$, $z = 14$. Then $x = \\frac{14^2 + 14}{1} = \\frac{196 + 14}{1} = 210$.\n$x = 210, y = 1, z = 14$. $xy - z^2 = 210(1) - 14^2 = 210 - 196 = 14$. $y^2 z - x = 1^2(14) - 210 = 14 - 210 = -196$.\nIf $p = 5$, then $25 - 25nq^2 = -14(n + 1)$, so $25 - 25nq^2 = -14n - 14$, which gives $25nq^2 - 14n = 39$, so $n(25q^2 - 14) = 39$.

{"question": "Compute the number of quadratic functions $f(x)=a x^{2}+b x+c$ with integer roots and integer coefficients whose graphs pass through the points $(0,0)$ and $(15,225)$.", "generated_responses": ["Let $f(x) = ax^2 + bx + c$ be a quadratic function with integer roots and integer coefficients. Since the graph passes through $(0,0)$, we have $f(0) = c = 0$. Thus, $f(x) = ax^2 + bx$.\nSince the graph passes through $(15,225)$, we have $f(15) = a(15^2) + b(15) = 225$, which simplifies to $225a + 15b = 225$. Dividing by 15, we get $15a + b = 15$, so $b = 15 - 15a$.\nSince $f(x)$ has integer roots, we can write $f(x) = a(x-r_1)(x-r_2)$ for some integers $r_1$ and $r_2$. Expanding this, we get $f(x) = a(x^2 - (r_1+r_2)x + r_1 r_2) = ax^2 - a(r_1+r_2)x + ar_1 r_2$.\nComparing this with $f(x) = ax^2 + bx$, we have $b = -a(r_1+r_2)$ and $0 = ar_1 r_2$. Since $a \\neq 0$, we must have $r_1 r_2 = 0$. Thus, either $r_1 = 0$ or $r_2 = 0$.\nIf $r_1 = 0$, then $f(x) = ax^2 - a(0+r_2)x = ax^2 - ar_2 x$. Comparing this with $f(x) = ax^2 + bx$, we have $b = -ar_2$. Since $b = 15-15a$, we have $15-15a = -ar_2$, so $15 = 15a - ar_2 = a(15-r_2)$. Thus, $a = \\frac{15}{15-r_2}$. Since $a$ is an integer, $15-r_2$ must be a divisor of 15. The divisors of 15 are $\\pm 1, \\pm 3, \\pm 5, \\pm 15$.\nIf $15-r_2 = 1$, then $r_2 = 14$, so $a = \\frac{15}{1} = 15$. Then $b = 15-15(15) = 15-225 = -210$.\nIf $15-r_2 = -1$, then $r_2 = 16$, so $a = \\frac{15}{-1} = -15$. Then $b = 15-15(-15) = 15+225 = 240$.\nIf $15-r_2 = 3$, then $r_2 = 12$, so $a = \\frac{15}{3} = 5$. Then $b = 15-15(5) = 15-75 = -60$.\nIf $15-r_2 = -3$, then $r_2 = 18$, so $a = \\frac{15}{-3} = -5$. Then $b = 15-15(-5) = 15+75 = 90$.\nIf $15-r_2 = 5$, then $r_2 = 10$, so $a = \\frac{15}{5} = 3$. Then $b = 15-15(3) = 15-45 = -30$.\nIf $15-r_2 = -5$, then $r_2 = 20$, so $a = \\frac{15}{-5} = -3$. Then $b = 15-15(-3) = 15+45 = 60$.\nIf $15-r_2 = 15$, then $r_2 = 0$, so $a = \\frac{15}{15} = 1$. Then $b = 15-15(1) = 15-15 = 0$.\nIf $15-r_2 = -15$, then $r_2 = 30$, so $a = \\frac{15}{-15} = -1$. Then $b = 15-15(-1) = 15+15 = 30$.\nIf $r_2 = 0$, then $f(x) = ax^2$. Since $f(15) = 225$, we have $a(15^2) = 225$, so $225a = 225$, which means $a = 1$. Then $b = 0$.\nThus, we have the following pairs $(a, b)$: $(15, -210)$, $(-15, 240)$, $(5, -60)$, $(-5, 90)$, $(3, -30)$, $(-3, 60)$, $(1, 0)$, $(-1, 30)$.\nIf $r_1 = 0$, then $f(x) = ax^2 - a(0+r_2)x = ax^2 - ar_2 x$. Comparing this with $f(x) = ax^2 + bx$, we have $b = -ar_2$. Since $b = 15-15a$, we have $15-15a = -ar_2$, so $15 = 15a - ar_2 = a(15-r_2)$. Thus, $a = \\frac{15}{15-r_2}$. Since $a$ is an integer, $15-r_2$ must be a divisor of 15. The divisors of 15 are $\\pm 1, \\pm 3, \\pm 5, \\pm 15$.\nIf $15-r_2 = 1$, then $r_2 = 14$, so $a = \\frac{15}{1} = 15$. Then $b = 15-15(15) = 15-225 = -210$.\nIf $15-r_2 = -1$, then $r_2 = 16$, so $a = \\frac{15}{-1} = -15$.

Then $b = 15-15(1) = 15-15 = 0$.\nIf $15-r_2 = -15$, then $r_2 = 30$, so $a = \\frac{15}{-15} = -1$. Then $b = 15-15(-1) = 15+15 = 30$.\nIf $r_1 = 0$, then $f(x) = ax^2 - a(0+r_2)x = ax^2 - ar_2 x$. Comparing this with $f(x) = ax^2 + bx$, we have $b = -ar_2$. Since $b = 15-15a$, we have $15-15a = -ar_2$, so $15 = 15a - ar_2 = a(15-r_2)$. Thus, $a = \\frac{15}{15-r_2}$. Since $a$ is an integer, $15-r_2$ must be a divisor of 15. The divisors of 15 are $\\pm 1, \\pm 3, \\pm 5, \\pm 15$.\nIf $15-r_2 = 1$, then $r_2 = 14$, so $a = \\frac{15}{1} = 15$. Then $b = 15-15(15) = 15-225 = -210$.\nIf $15-r_2 = -1$, then $r_2 = 16$, so $a = \\frac{15}{-1} = -15$. Then $b = 15-15(-15) = 15+225 = 240$.\nIf $15-r_2 = 3$, then $r_2 = 12$, so $a = \\frac{15}{3} = 5$.

Then $b = 15-15(1) = 15-15 = 0$.\nIf $15-r_2 = -15$, then $r_2 = 30$, so $a = \\frac{15}{-15} = -1$. Then $b = 15-15(-1) = 15+15 = 30$.\nIf $r_1 = 0$, then $f(x) = ax^2 - a(0+r_2)x = ax^2 - ar_2 x$. Comparing this with $f(x) = ax^2 + bx$, we have $b = -ar_2$. Since $b = 15-15a$, we have $15-15a = -ar_2$, so $15 = 15a - ar_2 = a(15-r_2)$. Thus, $a = \\frac{15}{15-r_2}$.

Then $b = 15-15(1) = 15-15 = 0$.\nIf $15-r_2 = -15$, then $r_2 = 30$, so $a = \\frac{15}{-15} = -1$. Then $b = 15-15(-1) = 15+15 = 30$.\nIf $r_1 = 0$, then $f(x) = ax^2 - a(0+r_2)x = ax^2 - ar_2 x$. Comparing this with $f(x) = ax^2 + bx$, we have $b = -ar_2$. Since $b = 15-15a$, we have $15-15a = -ar_2$, so $15 = 15a - ar_2 = a(15-r_2)$. Thus, $a = \\frac{15}{15-r_2}$.

{"question": "Let $T=T N Y W R$. The graph of $y=x^{2}+2 x-T$ intersects the $x$-axis at points $A$ and $M$, which are diagonally opposite vertices of square $A R M L$. Compute $[A R M L]$.", "generated_responses": ["Let the equation of the parabola be $y=x^2+2x-T$. Since the parabola intersects the $x$-axis at points $A$ and $M$, we have $x^2+2x-T=0$. Let $x_A$ and $x_M$ be the $x$-coordinates of $A$ and $M$, respectively. Then $x_A$ and $x_M$ are the roots of the quadratic equation $x^2+2x-T=0$. By Vieta's formulas, we have $x_A+x_M=-2$ and $x_A x_M = -T$.\nSince $A$ and $M$ are diagonally opposite vertices of square $A R M L$, the distance between $A$ and $M$ is the length of the diagonal of the square. The length of the diagonal is $\\sqrt{2}$ times the length of a side of the square.\nThe distance between $A$ and $M$ is $|x_A - x_M|$. We have\n$$(x_A - x_M)^2 = (x_A + x_M)^2 - 4x_A x_M = (-2)^2 - 4(-T) = 4+4T$$\nSo $|x_A - x_M| = \\sqrt{4+4T} = 2\\sqrt{1+T}$.\nThe length of the diagonal of the square is $2\\sqrt{1+T}$. Let $s$ be the length of a side of the square. Then $s\\sqrt{2} = 2\\sqrt{1+T}$, so $s = \\frac{2\\sqrt{1+T}}{\\sqrt{2}} = \\sqrt{2}\\sqrt{1+T} = \\sqrt{2(1+T)}$.\nThe area of the square is $s^2 = (\\sqrt{2(1+T)})^2 = 2(1+T) = 2+2T$.\nSince $A R M L$ is a square, the coordinates of $A$ and $M$ are $(x_A, 0)$ and $(x_M, 0)$, respectively.

If the equation has integer solutions, then the discriminant must be a perfect square. The discriminant is $D = 13^2 - 4(-n) = 169 + 4n$. We want $169 + 4n = k^2$ for some integer $k$. Then $4n = k^2 - 169 = (k-13)(k+13)$. Since $4n$ is divisible by 4, $k$ must be odd. Let $k = 2m+1$ for some integer $m$.

Then\n$$m \\approx \\frac{-1 \\pm 90.88}{2}$$\nThe positive root is approximately $\\frac{89.88}{2} \\approx 44.94$. Since $m$ must be an integer, we take $m=45$.\nThen $n = (45-6)(45+7) = 39 \\cdot 52 = 2028$.\nWe check that $n=2028$ gives $x^2 - 13x - 2028 = 0$.

Then $a = 120 - 5k$.\nWe have\n$$a = 120 - 5k$$\n$$a+d = 120 - 5k + 2k = 120 - 3k$$\n$$a+2d = 120 - 5k + 4k = 120 - k$$\n$$a+3d = 120 - 5k + 6k = 120 + k$$\n$$a+4d = 120 - 5k + 8k = 120 + 3k$$\n$$a+5d = 120 - 5k + 10k = 120 + 5k$$\nSince the angles are in arithmetic progression, we have $a < a+d < a+2d < a+3d < a+4d < a+5d$.\nWe have $a < 180$, so $120 - 5k < 180$, which means $-5k < 60$, so $k > -12$.\nAlso, $a+5d < 180$, so $120 + 5k < 180$, which means $5k < 60$, so $k < 12$.\nSince $k$ is an integer, we have $-11 \\le k \\le 11$.\nWe want to minimize $a = 120 - 5k$. This is minimized when $k$ is maximized, so we take $k=11$. Then $a = 120 - 5(11) = 120 - 55 = 65$.\nThe angles are $65, 65+22, 65+44, 65+66, 65+88, 65+110$, which are $65, 87, 109, 131, 153, 175$.\nSince $131 > 180$, this is not a valid solution.\nWe want to maximize $k$ such that $a+5d < 180$.

Thus, its equation is $y - \\frac{y_A + y_B}{2} = -\\frac{x_A}{y_A} \\left(x - \\frac{x_A + x_B}{2}\\right)$.\nSince $P$ lies on $AO$, we have $P = (x_P, y_P)$ where $y_P = \\frac{y_A}{x_A} x_P$.\nSubstituting this into the equation of the perpendicular line, we get\n$\\frac{y_A}{x_A} x_P -

{"question": "An $\\boldsymbol{n}$-label is a permutation of the numbers 1 through $n$. For example, $J=35214$ is a 5 -label and $K=132$ is a 3 -label. For a fixed positive integer $p$, where $p \\leq n$, consider consecutive blocks of $p$ numbers in an $n$-label. For example, when $p=3$ and $L=263415$, the blocks are 263,634,341, and 415. We can associate to each of these blocks a $p$-label that corresponds to the relative order of the numbers in that block. For $L=263415$, we get the following:\n\n$$\n\\underline{263} 415 \\rightarrow 132 ; \\quad 2 \\underline{63415} \\rightarrow 312 ; \\quad 26 \\underline{341} 5 \\rightarrow 231 ; \\quad 263 \\underline{415} \\rightarrow 213\n$$\n\nMoving from left to right in the $n$-label, there are $n-p+1$ such blocks, which means we obtain an $(n-p+1)$-tuple of $p$-labels. For $L=263415$, we get the 4 -tuple $(132,312,231,213)$. We will call this $(n-p+1)$-tuple the $\\boldsymbol{p}$-signature of $L$ (or signature, if $p$ is clear from the context) and denote it by $S_{p}[L]$; the $p$-labels in the signature are called windows.

So we have only one distinct value: $0$.\nCase 3: $a = d$. Then $\\sin x^{\\circ} = \\cot x^{\\circ} = \\frac{\\cos x^{\\circ}}{\\sin x^{\\circ}}$, so $\\sin^2 x^{\\circ} = \\cos x^{\\circ}$.

Since $0 \\le x \\le 360$, we have $0 \\le 45 + 180k \\le 360$ and $0 \\le 135 + 180k \\le 360$. Thus $-\\frac{45}{180} \\le k \\le \\frac{315}{180} = \\frac{7}{4} = 1.75$ and $-\\frac{135}{180} \\le k \\le \\frac{225}{180} = \\frac{5}{4} = 1.25$. Thus $k = 0, 1$.

This is impossible.\n\nThe possible values of $x$ are $0, 45, 90, 135, 225, 315, 360$.\nThe sum is $0 + 45 + 90 + 135 + 225 + 315 + 360 = 1170$.\n\nFinal Answer: The final answer is $\\boxed{1170}$"], "id": 2917, "generated_answers": ["1170"], "gold_answer": "990", "is_correct": false, "answers_correctness": [false]}

So $K=9$ is a root.\nThen $x = \\frac{\\sqrt{621 - 46(9) + 9^2}}{2} = \\frac{\\sqrt{621 - 414 + 81}}{2} = \\frac{\\sqrt{288}}{2} = \\frac{\\sqrt{144 \\cdot 2}}{2} = \\frac{12\\sqrt{2}}{2} = 6\\sqrt{2}$.\nThus, $AB = 6\\sqrt{2}$.\n\nFinal Answer: The final answer is $\\boxed{6\\sqrt{2}}$"], "id": 2968, "generated_answers": ["6\\sqrt{2}"], "gold_answer": "$6 \\sqrt{2}$", "is_correct": true, "answers_correctness": [true]}

Let $d_1, d_2, \\dots, d_k$ be the positive divisors of $n$. We are given that the product of all positive divisors of $n$ is $n^4$. We know that the product of all positive divisors of $n$ is $n^{k/2}$, where $k$ is the number of divisors of $n$. Thus, we have $n^{k/2} = n^4$. Since $n>1$, we can divide both sides by $n^4$ to get $n^{k/2 - 4} = 1$. This implies that $k/2 - 4 = 0$, so $k/2 = 4$, which means $k = 8$. Thus, $n$ has 8 divisors.\n\nThe number of divisors of $n$ is given by the formula $k = (a_1+1)(a_2+1)\\dots(a_m+1)$, where $n = p_1^{a_1} p_2^{a_2} \\dots p_m^{a_m}$ is the prime factorization of $n$. Since $k=8$, we have the following possibilities for the exponents $a_i$:\n\\begin{itemize}\n    \\item $8 = 8$: $n = p_1^7$. Then $n = 2^7 = 128$.\n    \\item $8 = 4 \\cdot 2$: $n = p_1^3 p_2^1$.

Compute the probability that no three faces of the same color share a common vertex.", "generated_responses": ["Let $N$ be the total number of ways to color the six faces of a cube with red or blue. Since each face can be colored in two ways, we have $N = 2^6 = 64$.\nLet $A$ be the event that no three faces of the same color share a common vertex. We want to find $P(A) = \\frac{|A|}{N}$.\nWe can consider the number of ways to color the cube such that there are exactly $k$ faces of one color and $6-k$ faces of the other color. The number of ways to choose $k$ faces out of 6 is $\\binom{6}{k}$. However, we need to consider the constraints on the coloring.\nIf all six faces are the same color, then there are three faces of the same color sharing a common vertex. So, we must have $k \\le 5$.\nIf $k=1$, then there is only one face of one color, so there are no three faces of the same color sharing a common vertex. There are $\\binom{6}{1} = 6$ ways to color the cube.\nIf $k=2$, then there are two faces of one color. We need to check if there are three faces of the same color sharing a common vertex. If the two faces are adjacent, then there are three faces of the same color sharing a common vertex. If the two faces are opposite, then there are no three faces of the same color sharing a common vertex. There are 12 pairs of adjacent faces and 3 pairs of opposite faces. So, there are $12 + 3 = 15$ ways to color the cube.\nIf $k=3$, then there are three faces of one color. We need to check if there are three faces of the same color sharing a common vertex. If the three faces are adjacent, then there are three faces of the same color sharing a common vertex. If the three faces are not adjacent, then there are no three faces of the same color sharing a common vertex. There are 8 sets of three adjacent faces.

If the four faces are adjacent, then there are three faces of the same color sharing a common vertex.

If the five faces are not adjacent, then there are no three faces of the same color sharing a common vertex. There are 6 sets of five adjacent faces. So, there are $6 + (6-6) = 6$ ways to color the cube.\nIf $k=6$, then there are six faces of one color. Then there are three faces of the same color sharing a common vertex. So, there are 0 ways to color the cube.\nThe total number of ways to color the cube such that no three faces of the same color share a common vertex is $6 + 15 + 20 + 15 + 6 = 62$.\nThe probability is $\\frac{62}{64} = \\frac{31}{32}$.\n\nLet's consider the case where there are three faces of one color.

{"question": "Scalene triangle $A B C$ has perimeter 2019 and integer side lengths. The angle bisector from $C$ meets $\\overline{A B}$ at $D$ such that $A D=229$. Given that $A C$ and $A D$ are relatively prime, compute $B C$.", "generated_responses": ["Let $a, b, c$ be the side lengths of triangle $ABC$, where $a = BC$, $b = AC$, and $c = AB$. We are given that $a+b+c = 2019$ and $AD = 229$. Also, $AC$ and $AD$ are relatively prime, so $\\gcd(b, 229) = 1$. Since $229$ is a prime number, this means that $b \\neq 229$.\n\nBy the Angle Bisector Theorem, we have $\\frac{AD}{BD} = \\frac{AC}{BC}$, so $\\frac{229}{BD} = \\frac{b}{a}$. Thus, $BD = \\frac{229a}{b}$. Since $BD$ is a length, it must be a positive real number. Also, $BD$ must be an integer because $a$ and $b$ are integers. Therefore, $b$ must divide $229a$. Since $\\gcd(b, 229) = 1$, we must have $b$ divide $a$.\n\nLet $a = kb$ for some integer $k$. Then $BD = \\frac{229a}{b} = \\frac{229kb}{b} = 229k$. Since $BD$ is a length, $k$ must be a positive integer. Also, $AB = c = BD + AD = 229k + 229 = 229(k+1)$. Then $a+b+c = kb + b + 229(k+1) = 2019$, so $b(k+1) + 229(k+1) = 2019$, which means $(b+229)(k+1) = 2019$.\n\nSince $2019 = 3 \\cdot 673$, the factors of 2019 are 1, 3, 673, 2019. We have $b+229$ and $k+1$ as factors of 2019. Since $b$ is a side length, $b > 0$, so $b+229 > 229$. Thus, $b+229$ can be 673 or 2019.\n\nIf $b+229 = 673$, then $b = 673 - 229 = 444$. Then $k+1 = \\frac{2019}{673} = 3$, so $k = 2$. Then $a = kb = 2(444) = 888$ and $c = 229(k+1) = 229(3) = 687$. We check $a+b+c = 888+444+687 = 2019$, which is correct. Also, $\\gcd(b, AD) = \\gcd(444, 229) = 1$, so $b$ and $AD$ are relatively prime.\n\nIf $b+229 = 2019$, then $b = 2019 - 229 = 1790$. Then $k+1 = \\frac{2019}{2019} = 1$, so $k = 0$. But $k$ must be a positive integer, so this case is not possible.\n\nTherefore, the only solution is $a = 888$, $b = 444$, and $c = 687$. Then $BC = a = 888$.\n\nFinal Answer: The final answer is $\\boxed{888}$"], "id": 2979, "generated_answers": ["888"], "gold_answer": "888", "is_correct": true, "answers_correctness": [true]}

{"question": "Elizabeth is in an \"escape room\" puzzle. She is in a room with one door which is locked at the start of the puzzle.

{"question": "Elizabeth is in an \"escape room\" puzzle. She is in a room with one door which is locked at the start of the puzzle. The room contains $n$ light switches, each of which is initially off. Each minute, she must flip exactly $k$ different light switches (to \"flip\" a switch means to turn it on if it is currently off, and off if it is currently on). At the end of each minute, if all of the switches are on, then the door unlocks and Elizabeth escapes from the room.\n\nLet $E(n, k)$ be the minimum number of minutes required for Elizabeth to escape, for positive integers $n, k$ with $k \\leq n$. For example, $E(2,1)=2$ because Elizabeth cannot escape in one minute (there are two switches and one must be flipped every minute) but she can escape in two minutes (by flipping Switch 1 in the first minute and Switch 2 in the second minute). Define $E(n, k)=\\infty$ if the puzzle is impossible to solve (that is, if it is impossible to have all switches on at the end of any minute).\n\nFor convenience, assume the $n$ light switches are numbered 1 through $n$.\nFind the following in terms of $n$. $E(n, 2)$ for positive even integers $n$", "generated_responses": ["Let $E(n, k)$ be the minimum number of minutes required for Elizabeth to escape, for positive integers $n, k$ with $k \\leq n$.\nWe want to find $E(n, 2)$ for positive even integers $n$.\nLet $n=2m$ for some positive integer $m$.\nWe want to find the minimum number of minutes required to turn on all $n$ switches by flipping exactly 2 switches each minute.\nLet $S$ be the set of switches.

Then $h_P = r_P$, $h_Q = r_Q$, $h_R = r_R$.\nSince $P', Q', R'$ are the projections of $P, Q, R$ onto the plane $\\mathcal{M}$, we have $P'Q' = \\sqrt{PQ^2 - (h_P - h_Q)^2}$, $Q'R' = \\sqrt{QR^2 - (h_Q - h_R)^2}$, $P'R' = \\sqrt{RP^2 - (h_R - h_P)^2}$.\nSince $h_P = r_P$, $h_Q = r_Q$, $h_R = r_R$, we have\n$P'Q' = \\sqrt{(r_P + r_Q)^2 - (r_P - r_Q)^2} = \\sqrt{r_P^2 + 2r_Pr_Q + r_Q^2 - (r_P^2 - 2r_Pr_Q + r_Q^2)} = \\sqrt{4r_Pr_Q} = 2\\sqrt{r_Pr_Q} = 12$, so $r_Pr_Q = 36$.\n$Q'R' = \\sqrt{(r_Q + r_R)^2 - (r_Q - r_R)^2} = \\sqrt{r_Q^2 + 2r_Qr_R + r_R^2 - (r_Q^2 - 2r_Qr_R + r_R^2)} = \\sqrt{4r_Qr_R} = 2\\sqrt{r_Qr_R} = 12$, so $r_Qr_R = 36$.\n$P'R' = \\sqrt{(r_R + r_P)^2 - (r_R - r_P)^2} = \\sqrt{r_R^2 + 2r_Rr_P + r_P^2 - (r_R^2 - 2r_Rr_P + r_P^2)} = \\sqrt{4r_Rr_P} = 2\\sqrt{r_Rr_P} = 6$, so $r_Rr_P = 9$.\nWe have $r_Pr_Q = 36$, $r_Qr_R = 36$, $r_Rr_P = 9$.\nMultiplying these equations, we get $(r_Pr_Q)(r_Qr_R)(r_Rr_P) = 36 \\cdot 36 \\cdot 9$, so $(r_Pr_Qr_R)^2 = 36^2 \\cdot 9 = (36 \\cdot 3)^2 = 108^2$, so $r_Pr_Qr_R = 108$.\nThen $r_P = \\frac{108}{r_Qr_R} = \\frac{108}{36} = 3$, $r_Q = \\frac{108}{r_Rr_P} = \\frac{108}{9} = 12$, $r_R = \\frac{108}{r_Pr_Q} = \\frac{108}{36} = 3$.\nThen $PQ = r_P + r_Q = 3 + 12 = 15$, $QR = r_Q + r_R = 12 + 3 = 15$, $RP = r_R + r_P = 3 + 3 = 6$.\nThe area of $\\triangle PQR$ is $\\frac{1}{2} |(PQ)(QR) \\sin \\angle PQR|$.\nWe have $PQ = 15$, $QR = 15$, $RP = 6$.\nBy the Law of Cosines, $RP^2 = PQ^2 + QR^2 - 2(PQ)(QR) \\cos \\angle PQR$, so $6^2 = 15^2 + 15^2 - 2(15)(15) \\cos \\angle PQR$, which means $36 = 225 + 225 - 450 \\cos \\angle PQR$, so $36 = 450 - 450 \\cos \\angle PQR$, so $450 \\cos \\angle PQR = 414$, so $\\cos \\angle PQR = \\frac{414}{450} = \\frac{207}{225} = \\frac{69}{75} = \\frac{23}{25}$.\nThen $\\sin \\angle PQR = \\sqrt{1 - \\cos^2 \\angle PQR} = \\sqrt{1 - \\left(\\frac{23}{25}\\right)^2} = \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{529}{625}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{96}{625}} = \\frac{\\sqrt{96}}{25} = \\frac{4\\sqrt{6}}{25}$.\nThe area of $\\triangle PQR$ is $\\frac{1}{2} (15)(15) \\sin \\angle PQR = \\frac{1}{2} (225) \\frac{4\\sqrt{6}}{25} = \\frac{225 \\cdot 4 \\sqrt{6}}{50} = \\frac{900 \\sqrt{6}}{50} = 18 \\sqrt{6}$.\n\nFinal Answer: The final answer is $\\boxed{18\\sqrt{6}}$"], "id": 3075, "generated_answers": ["18\\sqrt{6}"], "gold_answer": "$18 \\sqrt{6}$", "is_correct": true, "answers_correctness": [true]}

Let $Q = (x,y)$ be a point on the taxicab ellipse. Then $d(A,Q) + d(B,Q) = s$, where $d(A,Q) = |x-0| + |y-5| = |x| + |y-5|$ and $d(B,Q) = |x-12| + |y-0| = |x-12| + |y|$.\nThus, $|x| + |y-5| + |x-12| + |y| = s$.\nSince the ellipse passes through $(1,-1)$, we have $|1| + |-1-5| + |1-12| + |-1| = s$, so $1 + 6 + 11 + 1 = s$, which means $s = 19$.\nThus, $|x| + |y-5| + |x-12| + |y| = 19$.\nWe consider the four quadrants:\n\\begin{itemize}\n    \\item If $x \\ge 0$ and $y \\ge 5$, then $x + y-5 + x-12 + y = 19$, so $2x + 2y - 17 = 19$, which means $2x + 2y = 36$, or $x + y = 18$.\n    \\item If $x \\ge 0$ and $y < 5$, then $x + 5-y + x-12 + y = 19$, so $2x - 7 = 19$, which means $2x = 26$, or $x = 13$. But $x \\ge 0$ and $y < 5$, so this is not possible.\n    \\item If $x < 0$ and $y \\ge 5$, then $-x + y-5 + 12-x + y = 19$, so $-2x + 2y + 7 = 19$, which means $-2x + 2y = 12$, or $-x + y = 6$, so $y = x+6$. But $x < 0$ and $y \\ge 5$, so $x+6 \\ge 5$, which means $x \\ge -1$. Thus, $-1 \\le x < 0$.\n    \\item If $x < 0$ and $y < 5$, then $-x + 5-y + 12-x + y = 19$, so $-2x + 17 = 19$, which means $-2x = 2$, or $x = -1$.
