{"question": "If $f(x)$ is a polynomial of degree 7, and $g(x)$ is a polynomial of degree 7, then what is the product of the minimum and the maximum possible degrees of $f(x) + g(x)$?", "generated_responses": ["Let $f(x)$ be a polynomial of degree 7, and $g(x)$ be a polynomial of degree 7.\nThe degree of $f(x) + g(x)$ is the maximum of the degrees of $f(x)$ and $g(x)$, unless the leading coefficients of $f(x)$ and $g(x)$ are opposite in sign and equal in magnitude, in which case the degree of $f(x) + g(x)$ is less than 7.\nThe maximum possible degree of $f(x) + g(x)$ is 7, which occurs when the leading coefficients of $f(x)$ and $g(x)$ are not opposite in sign or equal in magnitude.\nThe minimum possible degree of $f(x) + g(x)$ is 0, which occurs when $f(x) = -g(x)$, so $f(x) + g(x) = 0$.\nThe product of the minimum and maximum possible degrees of $f(x) + g(x)$ is $0 \\cdot 7 = 0$.\n\nFinal Answer: The final answer is $\\boxed{0}$"], "id": "1", "generated_answers": ["0"], "gold_answer": "0", "is_correct": true, "answers_correctness": [true]}
