{"question": "Buzz, the hot new dining spot on campus, emphasizes simplicity. It only has two items on the menu, burgers and zucchini.

To convert this to Gyr:\n\\[ 13.8 \\text{ billion years} = 13.8 \\times 10^9 \\text{ years} = 13.8 \\text{ Gyr} \\]\n\nTo the nearest power of 10, this is \\( 10 \\) Gyr. The given answer is 10 Gyr, which is correct.\n\n### Subproblem 3: Number of stars in our Galaxy\nThe number of stars in our Galaxy is estimated to be around 100 billion. To format this as \\( x \\times 10^n \\):\n\\[ 100 \\text{ billion} = 100 \\times 10^9 = 1 \\times 10^{11} \\]\n\nSo, \\( x = 1 \\) and \\( n = 11 \\).

The average cost function is $AC(q) = \\frac{C(q)}{q}$. The marginal cost function is $MC(q) = \\frac{dC(q)}{dq}$.\n\nIn the long run, the firm can adjust all inputs, so the long-run average cost (LRAC) is the minimum average cost that can be achieved by the firm. In the short run, the firm can only adjust the variable inputs, so the short-run average cost (SRAC) is the average cost of production in the short run.\n\nThe firm minimizes its costs in the long run when the long-run average cost is at its minimum. This occurs when the long-run marginal cost (LRMC) is equal to the long-run average cost (LRAC). In other words, $LRMC = LRAC$.\n\nIn the short run, the firm minimizes its costs when the short-run marginal cost (SRMC) is equal to the short-run average cost (SRAC). In other words, $SRMC = SRAC$.\n\nThe condition that involves the SRAC is $SRAC = LRAC$.\n\nFinal Answer: The final answer is $\\boxed{SRAC=LRAC}$.\n\nFinal Answer: The final answer is

{"question": "Preamble: In Cambridge, shoppers can buy apples from two sources: a local orchard, and a store that ships apples from out of state. The orchard can produce up to 50 apples per day at a constant marginal cost of 25 cents per apple.
