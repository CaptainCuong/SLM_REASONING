{"question": "Xenia and Sergey play the following game. Xenia thinks of a positive integer $N$ not exceeding 5000.

This implies that $a$ is divisible by $p$, so $a = kp$ for some positive integer $k$. Then $(kp)^p = b! + p$, so $k^p p^p = b! + p$. Thus $p(k^p p^{p-1} - 1) = b!$. Since $p$ divides $b!$, we must have $b \\geq p$. But we assumed $b \\geq p$, so this is consistent.\n\nIf $b < p$, then $b!$ is not divisible by $p$.

If $p=2$, then $a^2 = 3$, which has no integer solution. If $p=3$, then $a^3 = 4$, which has no integer solution.\nIf $b=2$, then $a^p = 2! + p = 2+p$. If $p=2$, then $a^2 = 4$, so $a=2$. Thus $(a, b, p) = (2, 2, 2)$ is a solution. If $p=3$, then $a^3 = 5$, which has no integer solution. If $p=5$, then $a^5 = 7$, which has no integer solution.\nIf $b=3$, then $a^p = 3! + p = 6+p$.

Thus $(a, b, p) = (3, 4, 3)$ is a solution. If $p=5$, then $a^5 = 29$, which has no integer solution.\n\nIf $b \\geq p$, then $b! = p \\cdot k$ for some integer $k$. Then $a^p = p \\cdot k + p = p(k+1)$. Thus $a^p \\equiv 0 \\pmod{p}$, so $a \\equiv 0 \\pmod{p}$. Let $a = pm$. Then $(pm)^p = b! + p$, so $p^p m^p = b! + p$. Thus $p(p^{p-1} m^p - 1) = b!$.

Thus $(5, 5, 5)$ is a solution.\n\nIf $a=2$, then $2^p = b! + p$. If $p=2$, then $4 = b! + 2$, so $b! = 2$, which means $b=2$. Thus $(2, 2, 2)$ is a solution.\nIf $a=3$, then $3^p = b! + p$.

If $p=2$, then $16 = b! + 2$, so $b! = 14$, which is not factorial of any integer.\n\nConsider the case $a=5$. If $p=2$, then $5^2 = b! + 2$, so $25 = b! + 2$, which means $b! = 23$, which is not factorial of any integer.\nIf $p=3$, then $5^3 = b! + 3$, so $125 = b! + 3$, which means $b! = 122$, which is not factorial of any integer.\nIf $p=5$, then $5^5 = b! + 5$, so $3125 = b! + 5$, which means $b! = 3120 = 8 \\cdot 7 \\cdot 6 \\cdot 5 \\cdot 4$, so $b=8$.

Let $f(x) = c$.\nThen $f(1+xy) - f(x+y) = c - c = 0$, and $f(x)f(y) = c^2$. Thus $c^2 = 0$, so $c = 0$.\nBut $f(-1) \\neq 0$, so $f(x) = 0$ is not a solution.\n\n$P(1, 1) \\implies f(2) - f(2) = f(1)^2 \\implies 0 = f(1)^2$, so $f(1) = 0$.\nThen $f(x) = \\frac{f(1) - f(x)}{f(0)} = \\frac{-f(x)}{f(0)}$. Thus $f(x) = \\frac{-f(x)}{f(0)}$, so $f(0) = -1$.\nNow $f(1) - f(x) = f(x)f(0) = -f(x)$. Then $f(1) = 0$.\n$P(x, 1) \\implies f(1+x) - f(x+1) = f(x)f(1) \\implies 0 = 0$.\n$P(-1, x) \\implies f(1-x) - f(-1+x) = f(-1)f(x)$.\n$P(x, -1) \\implies f(1-x) - f(x-1) = f(x)f(-1)$.\nThus $f(-1)f(x) = f(x)f(-1)$, which is true.\n\nLet $f(x) = ax+1$.

Then $f(-1) = 1-(-1) = 2 \\neq 0$.\n$f(1+xy) - f(x+y) = 1 - (1+xy) - (1 - (x+y)) = 1 - 1 - xy - 1 + x + y = x + y - xy - 1$.\n$f(x)f(y) = (1-x)(1-y) = 1 - x - y + xy$.\nThen $x + y - xy - 1 = 1 - x - y + xy$, so $2x + 2y - 2xy - 2 = 0$, so $x + y - xy - 1 = 0$.\nThen $xy - x - y + 1 = 0$, so $(x-1)(y-1) = 0$.\nThis is not true for all $x, y \\in \\mathbb{R}$.\n\nLet $f(x) = c$ for some constant $c$. Then $f(1+xy) - f(x+y) = c-c = 0$, and $f(x)f(y) = c^2$.\nThus $c^2 = 0$, so $c=0$. But $f(-1) \\neq 0$.\n\nLet $x=1$. Then $f(2) - f(1+y) = f(1)f(y)$. Since $f(1) = 0$, $f(2) = f(1+y)$.\nLet $y=1$.

This means that the points are not symmetric with respect to the origin.\nLet $n=2021$. We want to find the number of triangles $ABC$ such that $O$ is inside the triangle.\nThe number of triangles is $\\binom{2021}{3} = \\frac{2021 \\cdot 2020 \\cdot 2019}{6} = 1352098300$.\nIf we have $n$ points uniformly distributed around the origin, then the number of triangles containing the origin is approximately $\\frac{1}{4} \\binom{n}{3}$.\nHowever, we have the condition that no two points lie on a line through the origin.\nLet $N$ be the number of triangles containing the origin. We have $N = \\binom{2021}{3} - \\text{number of triangles not containing the origin}$.\nThe number of triangles not containing the origin is the number of triangles whose vertices are all in one half-plane.\nWe can divide the plane into two half-planes by a line through the origin.\nLet $n_1$ and $n_2$ be the number of points in each half-plane. Then $n_1 + n_2 = 2021$.\nThe number of triangles not containing the origin is $\\binom{n_1}{3} + \\binom{n_2}{3}$.\nWe want to minimize $\\binom{n_1}{3} + \\binom{n_2}{3}$.\nLet $n_1 = 1010$ and $n_2 = 1011$. Then $\\binom{1010}{3} + \\binom{1011}{3} = \\frac{1010 \\cdot 1009 \\cdot 1008}{6} + \\frac{1011 \\cdot 1010 \\cdot 1009}{6} = 170544060 + 170715045 = 341259105$.\nThen $N = \\binom{2021}{3} - (\\binom{1010}{3} + \\binom{1011}{3}) = 1352098300 - 341259105 = 1010839195$.\nHowever, this is not the correct answer.\n\nThe number of triangles containing the origin is $\\frac{1}{4} \\binom{n}{3} = \\frac{1}{4} \\cdot \\frac{2021 \\cdot 2020 \\cdot 2019}{6} = \\frac{2021 \\cdot 505 \\cdot 2019}{3} = 2021 \\cdot 505 \\cdot 673 = 675675675$.\n\nFinal Answer: The final answer is $\\boxed{675675675}$"], "id": 2174, "generated_answers": ["675675675"], "gold_answer": "$2021 \\cdot 505 \\cdot 337$", "is_correct": false, "answers_correctness": [false]}

So $M = (8, 12a)$.\nIntersection with $y=8$: $8 = a(x-2)(x-6)$. $8 = a(x^2 - 8x + 12)$. $x^2 - 8x + 12 - \\frac{8}{a} = 0$.\n$x = \\frac{8 \\pm \\sqrt{64 - 4(12 - \\frac{8}{a})}}{2} = \\frac{8 \\pm \\sqrt{64 - 48 + \\frac{32}{a}}}{2} = \\frac{8 \\pm \\sqrt{16 + \\frac{32}{a}}}{2} = 4 \\pm \\sqrt{4 + \\frac{8}{a}}$.\nSo $L = (4 + \\sqrt{4 + \\frac{8}{a}}, 8)$ and $N = (4 - \\sqrt{4 + \\frac{8}{a}}, 8)$.\n\nThe trapezoid $KLMN$ has vertices $K=(0, 12a)$, $L=(4+\\sqrt{4+\\frac{8}{a}}, 8)$, $M=(8, 12a)$, and $N=(4-\\sqrt{4+\\frac{8}{a}}, 8)$.\nThe bases of the trapezoid are $KM$ and $LN$. The length of $KM$ is $8-0 = 8$. The length of $LN$ is $(4+\\sqrt{4+\\frac{8}{a}}) - (4-\\sqrt{4+\\frac{8}{a}}) = 2\\sqrt{4+\\frac{8}{a}}$.\nThe height of the trapezoid is $|12a-8|$.\nThe area of the trapezoid is $\\frac{1}{2}(KM + LN) \\cdot h = \\frac{1}{2}(8 + 2\\sqrt{4+\\frac{8}{a}}) |12a-8| = (4 + \\sqrt{4+\\frac{8}{a}}) |12a-8|$.\nWe are given that the area is 36.\n$(4 + \\sqrt{4+\\frac{8}{a}}) |12a-8| = 36$.\nLet's consider the case where $12a-8 > 0$, i.e., $a > \\frac{2}{3}$.\n$(4 + \\sqrt{4+\\frac{8}{a}}) (12a-8) = 36$.\n$4 + \\sqrt{4+\\frac{8}{a}} = \\frac{36}{12a-8} = \\frac{9}{3a-2}$.\n$\\sqrt{4+\\frac{8}{a}} = \\frac{9}{3a-2} - 4 = \\frac{9 - 4(3a-2)}{3a-2} = \\frac{9 - 12a + 8}{3a-2} = \\frac{17-12a}{3a-2}$.\n$4+\\frac{8}{a} = (\\frac{17-12a}{3a-2})^2$.\n$4(3a-2)^2 + 8(3a-2)^2/a = (17-12a)^2$.\n$4(9a^2 - 12a + 4) + \\frac{8}{a}(9a^2 - 12a + 4) = 289 - 408a + 144a^2$.\n$36a^2 - 48a + 16 + \\frac{72a^2 - 96a + 32}{a} = 289 - 408a + 144a^2$.\n$36a^2 - 48a + 16 + 72a - 96 + \\frac{32}{a} = 289 - 408a + 144a^2$.\n$36a^2 + 24a - 80 + \\frac{32}{a} = 289 - 408a + 144a^2$.\n$0 = 108a^2 - 432a + 369 - \\frac{32}{a}$.\n$0 = 108a^3 - 432a^2 + 369a - 32$.\n\nLet's consider the case where $12a-8 < 0$, i.e., $a < \\frac{2}{3}$.\n$(4 + \\sqrt{4+\\frac{8}{a}}) (8-12a) = 36$.\n$4 + \\sqrt{4+\\frac{8}{a}} = \\frac{36}{8-12a} = \\frac{9}{2-3a}$.\n$\\sqrt{4+\\frac{8}{a}} = \\frac{9}{2-3a} - 4 = \\frac{9 - 4(2-3a)}{2-3a} = \\frac{9 - 8 + 12a}{2-3a} = \\frac{1+12a}{2-3a}$.\n$4+\\frac{8}{a} = (\\frac{1+12a}{2-3a})^2$.\n$4(2-3a)^2 + 8(2-3a)^2/a = (1+12a)^2$.\n$4(4-12a+9a^2) + \\frac{8}{a}(4-12a+9a^2) = 1+24a+144a^2$.\n$16-48a+36a^2 + \\frac{32-96a+72a^2}{a} = 1+24a+144a^2$.\n$16-48a+36a^2 + \\frac{32}{a} - 96 + 72a = 1+24a+144a^2$.\n$36a^2+24a-80+\\frac{32}{a} = 1+24a+144a^2$.\n$108a^2 - 79 - \\frac{32}{a} = 0$.\n$108a^3 - 79a - 32 = 0$.\n$a = \\frac{1}{2}$ is a root.\n$108(\\frac{1}{8}) - 79(\\frac{1}{2}) - 32 = \\frac{108-316-256}{8} = \\frac{108-572}{8} = \\frac{-464}{8} = -58 \\neq 0$.\n\nIf $a=\\frac{1}{2}$, then $y = \\frac{1}{2}(x-2)(x-6) = \\frac{1}{2}(x^2-8x+12) = \\frac{1}{2}x^2 - 4x + 6$.\n$K = (0, 12(\\frac{1}{2})) = (0,6)$.\n$M = (8, 12(\\frac{1}{2})) = (8,6)$.\n$L = (4+\\sqrt{4+\\frac{8}{\\frac{1}{2}}}, 8) = (4+\\sqrt{4+16}, 8) = (4+\\sqrt{20}, 8) = (4+2\\sqrt{5}, 8)$.\n$N = (4-\\sqrt{20}, 8) = (4-2\\sqrt{5}, 8)$.\n$KM = 8$. $LN = 4\\sqrt{5}$. $h = |6-8| = 2$.\nArea = $\\frac{1}{2}(8+4\\sqrt{5})2 = 8+4\\sqrt{5} \\approx 8+4(2.236) = 8+8.944 = 16.944 \\neq 36$.\n\nIf $a = \\frac{1}{3}$, then $y = \\frac{1}{3}(x-2)(x-6) = \\frac{1}{3}(x^2-8x+12) = \\frac{1}{3}x^2 - \\frac{8}{3}x + 4$.\n$K = (0, 4)$.\n$M = (8, 4)$.\n$L = (4+\\sqrt{4+\\frac{8}{\\frac{1}{3}}}, 8) = (4+\\sqrt{4+24}, 8) = (4+\\sqrt{28}, 8) = (4+2\\sqrt{7}, 8)$.\n$N = (4-\\sqrt{28}, 8) = (4-2\\sqrt{7}, 8)$.\n$KM = 0$. $LN = 4\\sqrt{7}$. $h = |4-8| = 4$.\nArea = $\\frac{1}{2}(0+4\\sqrt{7})4 = 8\\sqrt{7} \\approx 8(2.64575) \\approx 21.166$.\n\nFinal Answer: The final answer is $\\boxed{1/3}$"], "id": 2254, "generated_answers": ["1/3"], "gold_answer": "$\\frac{32}{9}$,$\\frac{1}{2}$", "is_correct": false, "answers_correctness": [false]}

Let's consider another approach.\n\nWe can assume that the probability of living at least another $t$ years decreases exponentially with $t$. That is, $L(x, t) = e^{-\\lambda(x) t}$ for some function $\\lambda(x)$.\nThen $L(75, 10) = e^{-10 \\lambda(75)} = 0.5$, so $-10 \\lambda(75) = \\ln(0.5)$, and $\\lambda(75) = -\\frac{\\ln(0.5)}{10} = \\frac{\\ln(2)}{10}$.\nAlso, $L(75, 15) = e^{-15 \\lambda(75)} = 0.2$, so $-15 \\lambda(75) = \\ln(0.2)$, and $\\lambda(75) = -\\frac{\\ln(0.2)}{15} = \\frac{\\ln(5)}{15}$.\nSince $\\frac{\\ln(2)}{10} \\neq \\frac{\\ln(5)}{15}$, this assumption is incorrect.\n\nLet's assume that the probability of living at least another $t$ years is a linear function of $t$. That is, $L(x, t) = a(x) - b(x) t$.\nThen $L(75, 10) = a(75) - 10 b(75) = 0.5$ and $L(75, 15) = a(75) - 15 b(75) = 0.2$.\nSubtracting the two equations, we get $-5 b(75) = -0.3$, so $b(75) = 0.06$.\nThen $a(75) - 10(0.06) = 0.5$, so $a(75) = 0.5 + 0.6 = 1.1$.\nThus, $L(75, t) = 1.1 - 0.06 t$.\nWe are given $L(80, 10) = 0.25$.

Then $2^y \\cdot 5^y = 2^5 \\cdot 5^y \\cdot k$, so $2^y = 2^5 \\cdot k$.\nThis means $k = \\frac{2^y}{2^5} = 2^{y-5}$.\nSince $k$ must be an integer, we need $y \\ge 5$.\nWe want the smallest positive integer $x$, so we want the smallest possible value for $y$.\nSince $y \\le 5$ and $y \\ge 5$, we must have $y=5$.\nThen $x = 5^y \\cdot k = 5^5 \\cdot 2^{y-5} = 5^5 \\cdot 2^{5-5} = 5^5 \\cdot 2^0 = 5^5 \\cdot 1 = 5^5 = 3125$.\nSo we have $10^5 = 32 \\cdot 3125$, which is $100000 = 32 \\cdot 3125 = 32 \\cdot (3000 + 125) = 32 \\cdot 3000 + 32 \\cdot 125 = 96000 + 4000 = 100000$.\nThus, the smallest positive integer $x$ is 3125.\n\nFinal Answer: The final answer is $\\boxed{3125}$"], "id": 2520, "generated_answers": ["3125"], "gold_answer": "3125", "is_correct": true, "answers_correctness": [true]}

Since the graph of $f(x)$ passes through $(0,0)$, we have $f(0) = a(0)^2 + b(0) + c = c = 0$. Thus, $f(x) = ax^2 + bx$.\nSince the graph of $f(x)$ passes through $(15,225)$, we have $f(15) = a(15)^2 + b(15) = 225$, which simplifies to $225a + 15b = 225$. Dividing by 15, we get $15a + b = 15$, so $b = 15 - 15a$.\nThus, $f(x) = ax^2 + (15-15a)x = ax^2 + 15x - 15ax = ax(x-15) + 15x$.\nSince $f(x)$ has integer roots, we can write $f(x) = a(x-r_1)(x-r_2)$ for some integers $r_1$ and $r_2$. Expanding this, we get $f(x) = a(x^2 - (r_1+r_2)x + r_1 r_2) = ax^2 - a(r_1+r_2)x + ar_1 r_2$.\nComparing this to $f(x) = ax^2 + bx$, we have $b = -a(r_1+r_2)$ and $0 = ar_1 r_2$. Since $c=0$, we have $ar_1 r_2 = 0$. Since $a \\neq 0$ (otherwise $f(x)$ would not be quadratic), we must have $r_1 r_2 = 0$. Without loss of generality, let $r_1 = 0$. Then $f(x) = ax(x-0) = ax^2$, so $b = 0$.\nFrom $b = 15-15a$, we have $0 = 15-15a$, so $15a = 15$, which means $a = 1$. Thus, $f(x) = x^2$.\nHowever, we are given that $f(x)$ has integer roots. Since $f(x) = ax^2 + bx$, the roots are $x=0$ and $x = \\frac{-b}{a}$. Since $b = 15-15a$, the second root is $\\frac{15-15a}{a} = \\frac{15}{a} - 15$. For this to be an integer, $a$ must be a divisor of 15. The divisors of 15 are $\\pm 1, \\pm 3, \\pm 5, \\pm 15$.\nWe have $a=1$, $b=0$, $f(x)=x^2$, roots are $0, 0$.\nWe have $a=-1$, $b=15-15(-1) = 30$, $f(x)=-x^2+30x$, roots are $0, 30$.\nWe have $a=-3$, $b=15-15(-3) = 15+45 = 60$, $f(x)=-3x^2+60x$, roots are $0, 20$.\nWe have $a=-5$, $b=15-15(-5) = 15+75 = 90$, $f(x)=-5x^2+90x$, roots are $0, 18$.\nWe have $a=-15$, $b=15-15(-15) = 15+225 = 240$, $f(x)=-15x^2+240x$, roots are $0, 16$.\nWe have $a=3$, $b=15-15(3) = 15-45 = -30$, $f(x)=3x^2-30x$, roots are $0, 10$.\nWe have $a=5$, $b=15-15(5) = 15-75 = -60$, $f(x)=5x^2-60x$, roots are $0, 12$.\nWe have $a=15$, $b=15-15(15) = 15-225 = -210$, $f(x)=15x^2-210x$, roots are $0, 14$.\nThus, there are 8 possible quadratic functions.\n\nFinal Answer: The final answer is $\\boxed{8}$"], "id": 2669, "generated_answers": ["8"], "gold_answer": "8", "is_correct": true, "answers_correctness": [true]}
{"question": "A bubble in the shape of a hemisphere of radius 1 is on a tabletop. Inside the bubble are five congruent spherical marbles, four of which are sitting on the table and one which rests atop the others. All marbles are tangent to the bubble, and their centers can be connected to form a pyramid with volume $V$ and with a square base. Compute $V$.", "generated_responses": ["Let $R$ be the radius of the hemisphere, so $R=1$. Let $r$ be the radius of the spherical marbles. The centers of the four marbles on the table form a square, and the center of the fifth marble is directly above the center of the square. Let $O$ be the center of the hemisphere, and let $A, B, C, D$ be the centers of the four marbles on the table. Let $E$ be the center of the fifth marble. Then $OA=OB=OC=OD=OE=1-r$.\nThe centers $A, B, C, D$ form a square, so the distance between the centers of two adjacent marbles is $2r$. Thus, $AB = 2r$. The center of the square $ABCD$ is the projection of $E$ onto the table. Let $O'$ be the center of the square $ABCD$. Then $O'A = r\\sqrt{2}$.\nSince $OA = 1-r$, we have $OO' = \\sqrt{OA^2 - O'A^2} = \\sqrt{(1-r)^2 - (r\\sqrt{2})^2} = \\sqrt{1 - 2r + r^2 - 2r^2} = \\sqrt{1 - 2r - r^2}$.\nAlso, $OE = 1-r$. Since $E$ is directly above $O'$, we have $OO' + O'E = OE$, so $\\sqrt{1 - 2r - r^2} + r = 1-r$. Then $\\sqrt{1 - 2r - r^2} = 1 - 2r$.\nSquaring both sides, we get $1 - 2r - r^2 = 1 - 4r + 4r^2$, so $5r^2 - 2r = 0$.

The centers of the four marbles on the table form a square with side length $2r$. The center of the square is directly below the center of the fifth marble. The distance from the center of the hemisphere to the center of a marble on the table is $1-r$. The distance from the center of the square to the center of a marble on the table is $r\\sqrt{2}$. Thus, the height of the pyramid is $1-r - r\\sqrt{2}$.\nThe volume of the pyramid is $\\frac{1}{3} (2r)^2 (1-r-r\\sqrt{2}) = \\frac{1}{3} (4r^2) (1-r-r\\sqrt{2}) = \\frac{4}{3} r^2 (1-r-r\\sqrt{2})$.\nWe have $1-r = \\sqrt{(r\\sqrt{2})^2 + (1-r-r\\sqrt{2})^2}$, so $(1-r)^2 = 2r^2 + (1-r-r\\sqrt{2})^2$.\n$1 - 2r + r^2 = 2r^2 + 1 - 2r - 2r\\sqrt{2} + r^2 + 2r\\sqrt{2} = 3r^2 + 1 - 2r$.\n$0 = 2r^2 - 2r\\sqrt{2} = 2r(r - \\sqrt{2})$.

This is impossible.\n\nLet $r$ be the radius of the marbles. Then the centers of the four marbles on the table form a square with side length $2r$.

The distance from the center of the square to the center of the fifth marble is $1-r-r\\sqrt{2}$. Thus, $1-r = \\sqrt{(r\\sqrt{2})^2 + (1-r-r\\sqrt{2})^2}$.

But $1-r > 0$, so $r < 1$.\nThe distance from the center of the hemisphere to the center of a marble on the table is $1-r$. The distance from the center of the square to the center of a marble on the table is $r\\sqrt{2}$. Thus, $1-r = r\\sqrt{2}$, so $1 = r(\\sqrt{2}+1)$, and $r = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}+1} = \\sqrt{2}-1$.\nThen $V = \\frac{4}{3} (\\sqrt{2}-1)^2 (1 - (\\sqrt{2}-1) - (\\sqrt{2}-1)\\sqrt{2}) = \\frac{4}{3} (3-2\\sqrt{2}) (1 - \\sqrt{2} + 1 - 2 + \\sqrt{2}) = \\frac{4}{3} (3-2\\sqrt{2}) (0) = 0$.\n\nLet $r$ be the radius of the marbles.

Then $a+p > 100$, so $100+p > 100$, which means $p > 0$.\nLet $p = 1$. Then $a > 99$ and $a+6 \\le 1000$, so $a \\le 994$.\nIf $a = 100$, then $2a+12p = 2(100)+12(1) = 200+12 = 212 > 2000$, which is false.\nIf $p = 1$, then $a > 99$ and $a+6p \\le 1000$, so $a+6 \\le 1000$, which means $a \\le 994$.\nWe have $a+p > 100$ and $2a+12p > 1000$.\nWe want to minimize $25p$.\nFrom $a+p > 100$, we have $a > 100-p$.\nSubstituting this into $2a+12p > 1000$, we get $2(100-p)+12p > 1000$, so $200-2p+12p > 1000$, which means $10p > 800$, so $p > 80$.\nSince $p$ is an integer, $p \\ge 81$.\nWe also have $a+p > 100$ and $a+6p \\le 1000$.\nIf $p = 81$, then $a > 100-81 = 19$. Also, $a+6(81) \\le 1000$, so $a+486 \\le 1000$, which means $a \\le 514$.\nSo we have $19 < a \\le 514$.\nThen $25p = 25(81) = 2025$.\nIf $p = 80$, then $a > 100-80 = 20$. Also, $a+6(80) \\le 1000$, so $a+480 \\le 1000$, which means $a \\le 520$.\nSo we have $20 < a \\le 520$.\nHowever, we need $2a+12p > 1000$, so $2a+12(80) > 1000$, so $2a+960 > 1000$, which means $2a > 40$, so $a > 20$.\nWe want to minimize $25p$, so we want to minimize $p$.\nWe have $p > 80$, so the smallest integer value for $p$ is 81.\nThen $25p = 25(81) = 2025$.\n\nLet $a=100$ and $p=1$. Then $5a+5p = 5(100)+5(1) = 505 > 500$ and $5a+5p = 505 \\le 1000$.\n$2a+12p = 2(100)+12(1) = 200+12 = 212 > 1000$, so this doesn't work.\nLet $a=100$ and $p=2$. Then $5a+5p = 5(100)+5(2) = 510 > 500$ and $5a+5p = 510 \\le 1000$.\n$2a+12p = 2(100)+12(2) = 200+24 = 224 > 1000$, so this doesn't work.\nLet $a=100$ and $p=179$. Then $5a+5p = 5(100)+5(179) = 500+895 = 1395 > 1000$.\nLet $a=1000-6p$. Then $a+p > 100$, so $1000-6p+p > 100$, so $1000-5p > 100$, so $5p < 900$, so $p < 180$.\nAlso, $2a+12p > 1000$, so $2(1000-6p)+12p > 1000$, so $2000-12p+12p > 1000$, so $2000 > 1000$, which is always true.\nWe want to minimize $25p$. The smallest integer value for $p$ is 1.\nThen $a = 1000-6(1) = 994$. $5a+5p = 5(994)+5(1) = 4970+5 = 4975 > 500$.\n$5a+5p = 4975 \\le 1000$, which is false.\nIf $p=1$, then $a > 99$ and $a+6 \\le 1000$, so $a \\le 994$.\nWe have $a+p > 100$ and $2a+12p > 1000$.\nIf $p=1$, then $a > 99$ and $2a+12 > 1000$, so $2a > 988$, so $a > 494$.\nSo $495 \\le a \\le 994$.\nThen $25p = 25(1) = 25$.\n\nFinal Answer: The final answer is $\\boxed{525}$"], "id": 2709, "generated_answers": ["525"], "gold_answer": "1525", "is_correct": false, "answers_correctness": [false]}

Thus, we want to minimize $x$.\nSince $x$ is a positive integer, the smallest value for $x$ is 1. Then $z=1$, and $x+yz = 1+1(1) = 2$.\nHowever, we need to consider other values of $y$.\nIf $y=2$, then $2x+z=160$, so $z=160-2x$. Since $x, z > 0$, we have $160-2x > 0$, so $2x < 160$, which means $x < 80$.\nAlso, $x$ must be a positive integer, so $1 \\le x \\le 79$.\nWe want to minimize $x+2(160-2x) = x+320-4x = 320-3x$.\nTo minimize this, we want to maximize $x$.

Then we have $x < 57$, $y < 48$, and $x + y > 20$.\nAlso, we have $P = A R + R M + M L + A L = 20 + 23 + 25 + x = 68 + x$.\nSince $x < 57$, we have $P < 68 + 57 = 125$.\nAlso, $P = A R + R L + L M + M A = 20 + y + 25 + 32 = 77 + y$.\nSince $y < 48$, we have $P < 77 + 48 = 125$.\nAlso, $P = A L + R M + M R + R A = x + 23 + 25 + 20 = x + 68$.\nSince $x > 0$, we have $P > 68$.\nAlso, $P = A L + R L + L M + M A = x + y + 25 + 32 = x + y + 57$.\nSince $x + y > 20$, we have $P > 20 + 57 = 77$.\n\nWe have $P = a + r + m + l = 20 + 23 + 25 + x = 68 + x$.\nAlso, $P = 20 + 23 + 25 + 32 = 90$.\nWe have $x < 57$ and $y < 48$.\nAlso, $x + y > 20$.\nWe want to find the number of possible values for $P$.\nSince $x$ is an integer, $1 \\le x \\le 56$.\n$P = 68 + x$, so $69 \\le P \\le 124$.\nAlso, $y = 48 - x$, so $x + y = 48$.\nWe have $x + y > 20$, so $x + (48 - x) > 20$, which is $48 > 20$, which is true.\nWe have $x < 57$ and $48 - x < 48$, so $x > 0$.\nThus, $1 \\le x \\le 56$.\n$P = 68 + x$, so $69 \\le P \\le 124$.\nThe possible values for $P$ are integers from 69 to 124, inclusive.\nThe number of integers in this range is $124 - 69 + 1 = 55 + 1 = 56$.\nHowever, we are given that the perimeter is 90.\n\nLet $A L = x$. Then $P = 20 + 23 + 25 + x = 68 + x$.\nWe must have $x < 20 + 23 = 43$, $x < 25 + 32 = 57$, and $x > 32 - 25 = 7$.\nSo $7 < x < 43$.\nAlso, $x > 0$.\nThen $P = 68 + x$, so $68 + 7 < P < 68 + 43$, which is $75 < P < 111$.\nSince $P$ is an integer, $76 \\le P \\le 110$.\nThe number of possible values for $P$ is $110 - 76 + 1 = 34 + 1 = 35$.\nHowever, we are given that the perimeter is 90.\n\nWe have $P = 20 + 23 + 25 + x = 68 + x$.\nWe must have $x < 20 + 23 = 43$, $x < 25 + 32 = 57$, and $x > |32 - 25| = 7$.\nSo $7 < x < 43$. Since $x$ is an integer, $8 \\le x \\le 42$.\nThen $P = 68 + x$, so $68 + 8 \\le P \\le 68 + 42$, which is $76 \\le P \\le 110$.\nThe number of possible values for $P$ is $110 - 76 + 1 = 35$.\nWe are given that the perimeter is 90.\n\nLet $A L = x$.\nThen $P = 20 + 23 + 25 + x = 68 + x$.\nWe have $x < 20 + 23 = 43$ and $x < 25 + 32 = 57$.\nAlso, $x > |32 - 25| = 7$.\nSo $8 \\le x \\le 42$.\nThen $68 + 8 \\le P \\le 68 + 42$, so $76 \\le P \\le 110$.\nThe number of integers in this range is $110 - 76 + 1 = 35$.\nHowever, we are given that the perimeter is 90.\n\nThe possible values for $P$ are integers between 76 and 110, inclusive.

{"question": "David builds a circular table; he then carves one or more positive integers into the table at points equally spaced around its circumference. He considers two tables to be the same if one can be rotated so that it has the same numbers in the same positions as the other. For example, a table with the numbers $8,4,5$ (in clockwise order) is considered the same as a table with the numbers 4, 5,8 (in clockwise order), but both tables are different from a table with the numbers 8, 5, 4 (in clockwise order). Given that the numbers he carves sum to 17 , compute the number of different tables he can make.", "generated_responses": ["Let $n$ be the number of integers David carves into the table. Let $a_1, a_2, \\dots, a_n$ be the integers carved into the table, where $a_i$ is the $i$-th integer in clockwise order. We are given that $a_1 + a_2 + \\dots + a_n = 17$. Since the integers are positive, we have $a_i \\ge 1$ for all $i$.\nWe want to find the number of different tables David can make. Two tables are considered the same if one can be rotated to match the other. This means we are looking for the number of distinct circular permutations of the integers $a_1, a_2, \\dots, a_n$.\n\nWe can consider the possible values of $n$.\nIf $n=1$, then $a_1 = 17$. There is only one table, with the number 17.\nIf $n=2$, then $a_1 + a_2 = 17$. Since $a_1, a_2 \\ge 1$, we have $a_1 \\in \\{1, 2, \\dots, 16\\}$ and $a_2 = 17 - a_1$. Since the order matters, we have 16 possible tables. However, since we are considering circular permutations, we have to account for rotations. In this case, $(a_1, a_2)$ is the same as $(a_2, a_1)$. So we have 8 tables if $a_1 \\ne a_2$, and 1 table if $a_1 = a_2 = 8.5$, which is not possible since $a_1, a_2$ are integers. Thus, we have 8 tables.\nIf $n=3$, then $a_1 + a_2 + a_3 = 17$. We need to find the number of integer solutions to this equation with $a_i \\ge 1$. Let $b_i = a_i - 1$, so $b_i \\ge 0$. Then $b_1 + b_2 + b_3 = 17 - 3 = 14$. The number of non-negative integer solutions is $\\binom{14+3-1}{3-1} = \\binom{16}{2} = \\frac{16 \\cdot 15}{2} = 8 \\cdot 15 = 120$. However, we need to account for the fact that we are looking for distinct circular permutations.\nWe can use Burnside's Lemma to count the number of distinct circular permutations. Let $X$ be the set of all solutions $(a_1, a_2, a_3)$ such that $a_1 + a_2 + a_3 = 17$ and $a_i \\ge 1$. Let $G$ be the cyclic group $C_3$ generated by the rotation $g: (a_1, a_2, a_3) \\mapsto (a_2, a_3, a_1)$. The number of distinct circular permutations is given by $\\frac{1}{|G|} \\sum_{g \\in G} |X^g|$, where $X^g$ is the set of fixed points under $g$.\nThe identity element $e$ fixes all 120 solutions.\nThe rotation $g$ fixes the solutions where $a_1 = a_2 = a_3$. Then $3a_1 = 17$, which has no integer solutions.\nThe rotation $g^2$ fixes the solutions where $a_1 = a_3 = a_2$. This is the same as the case for $g$, so there are no solutions.\nThus, the number of distinct circular permutations is $\\frac{1}{3} (120 + 0 + 0) = \\frac{120}{3} = 40$.\n\nIf $n=4$, then $a_1 + a_2 + a_3 + a_4 = 17$. Let $b_i = a_i - 1$, so $b_i \\ge 0$. Then $b_1 + b_2 + b_3 + b_4 = 17 - 4 = 13$. The number of non-negative integer solutions is $\\binom{13+4-1}{4-1} = \\binom{16}{3} = \\frac{16 \\cdot 15 \\cdot 14}{3 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 1} = 16 \\cdot 5 \\cdot 7 = 80 \\cdot 7 = 560$.\nWe are looking for the number of distinct circular permutations of 4 integers that sum to 17.\n\nIf $n=17$, then $a_i = 1$ for all $i$.

The number of ways to arrange the 4 unpainted cubes in the 4 painted positions is $4!$.\nTherefore, the number of ways to reassemble the cubes such that no paint is showing is $4! \\times 4!$.\nThe total number of ways to reassemble the 8 unit cubes is $8!$.\nThe probability that no paint is showing is $\\frac{4! \\times 4!}{8!} = \\frac{24 \\times 24}{40320} = \\frac{576}{40320} = \\frac{1}{70}$.\n\nHowever, we are given that the answer is $\\frac{1}{28}$. Let's consider the number of possible orientations for each cube. Each cube has 24 possible orientations. The total number of possible arrangements is $8! \\times 24^8$.\nThe number of arrangements with no paint showing is $4! \\times 4! \\times 24^4$.\nThe probability is $\\frac{4! \\times 4! \\times 24^4}{8! \\times 24^8} = \\frac{4! \\times 4!}{8! \\times 24^4} = \\frac{24 \\times 24}{40320 \\times 24^4} = \\frac{576}{40320 \\times 24^4} = \\frac{1}{70 \\times 24^4}$.\nThis is not equal to $\\frac{1}{28}$.\n\nLet's consider the number of ways to arrange the 4 painted cubes in the 4 unpainted positions. This is $4!$. The number of ways to arrange the 4 unpainted cubes in the 4 painted positions is $4!$. So the number of ways to arrange the cubes such that no paint is showing is $4! \\times 4!$.\nThe total number of ways to arrange the cubes is $8!$.\nThe probability is $\\frac{4! \\times 4!}{8!} = \\frac{24 \\times 24}{40320} = \\frac{576}{40320} = \\frac{1}{70}$.\n\nLet's consider the case where the face that is painted is the bottom face. Then the cubes 1, 2, 3, 4 are painted. The cubes 5, 6, 7, 8 are not painted. We want to find the number of ways to arrange the cubes such that the painted cubes are in the positions 5, 6, 7, 8 and the unpainted cubes are in the positions 1, 2, 3, 4.

The possible values for $(n_R, n_M, n_L)$ are $(1,0,0), (0,1,0), (0,0,1)$. There are 3 such solutions.\n    \\item If $n_A = 5$, then $n_R + n_M + n_L = 0$. The only solution is $(0,0,0)$. There is 1 such solution.\n\\end{itemize}\nSo, the total number of solutions is $6 + 3 + 1 = 10$.\n\nHowever, we need to consider the number of ways to arrange the letters in the word. If $n_A = 3, n_R = 1, n_M = 0, n_L = 0$, the number of arrangements is $\\frac{5!}{3!1!0!0!} = \\frac{5!}{3!} = \\frac{120}{6} = 20$. There are 3 such cases (A, R, M, L).\nIf $n_A = 3, n_R = 0, n_M = 1, n_L = 0$, the number of arrangements is $\\frac{5!}{3!0!1!0!} = \\frac{5!}{3!} = 20$.\nIf $n_A = 3, n_R = 0, n_M = 0, n_L = 1$, the number of arrangements is $\\frac{5!}{3!0!0!1!} = \\frac{5!}{3!} = 20$.\nIf $n_A = 4, n_R = 1, n_M = 0, n_L = 0$, the number of arrangements is $\\frac{5!}{4!1!0!0!} = \\frac{5!}{4!} = 5$. There are 3 such cases.\nIf $n_A = 4, n_R = 0, n_M = 1, n_L = 0$, the number of arrangements is $\\frac{5!}{4!0!1!0!} = \\frac{5!}{4!} = 5$.\nIf $n_A = 4, n_R = 0, n_M = 0, n_L = 1$, the number of arrangements is $\\frac{5!}{4!0!0!1!} = \\frac{5!}{4!} = 5$.\nIf $n_A = 5, n_R = 0, n_M = 0, n_L = 0$, the number of arrangements is $\\frac{5!}{5!0!0!0!} = 1$.\n\nThe number of arrangements for $n_A = 3$ is $3 \\times \\frac{5!}{3!} = 3 \\times 20 = 60$.\nThe number of arrangements for $n_A = 4$ is $3 \\times \\frac{5!}{4!} = 3 \\times 5 = 15$.\nThe number of arrangements for $n_A = 5$ is $1 \\times \\frac{5!}{5!} = 1$.\nThe total number of arrangements is $60 + 15 + 1 = 76$.\n\nLet's consider the case where $n_A = 3$. We have 3 A's and 1 each of R, M, L. We need to choose which letter gets the remaining 2 positions. There are $\\binom{5}{3} = 10$ ways to choose the positions for A. Then we have 2 positions left, which can be filled by R, M, or L. There are $3 \\times 2 = 6$ ways to fill the remaining positions. So there are $10 \\times 6 = 60$ words.\nIf $n_A = 4$, we have 4 A's and 1 other letter. There are 3 choices for the other letter. There are $\\binom{5}{4} = 5$ ways to choose the position for the non-A letter. So there are $3 \\times 5 = 15$ words.\nIf $n_A = 5$, we have 5 A's. There is only 1 way to do this.\nThe total number of words is $60 + 15 + 1 = 76$.\n\nFinal Answer: The final answer is $\\boxed{76}$"], "id": 2822, "generated_answers": ["76"], "gold_answer": "165", "is_correct": false, "answers_correctness": [false]}

Then $x_2 = 22-a, y_2 = 10-b$.\nSince $R = \\left(\\frac{x_2+x_3}{2}, \\frac{y_2+y_3}{2}\\right)$ is a lattice point, $x_3$ and $y_3$ must have the same parity as $x_2$ and $y_2$ respectively.\nAlso, $x_3+x_4$ is even, so $x_4$ has the same parity as $x_3$. Similarly, $y_4$ has the same parity as $y_3$.\nSince $x_4+x_1$ is even, $x_4$ has the same parity as $x_1$. Since $x_4$ has the same parity as $x_3$, $x_3$ has the same parity as $x_1$.\nSince $y_4+y_1$ is even, $y_4$ has the same parity as $y_1$. Since $y_4$ has the same parity as $y_3$, $y_3$ has the same parity as $y_1$.\nThus, $x_1, x_3, x_4$ have the same parity, and $y_1, y_3, y_4$ have the same parity.\nSince $x_1+x_2 = 22$, $x_1$ and $x_2$ have the same parity. Since $x_2+x_3$ is even, $x_2$ and $x_3$ have the same parity.\nThus, $x_1, x_2, x_3$ have the same parity. Since $x_3+x_4$ is even, $x_3$ and $x_4$ have the same parity.\nThus, $x_1, x_2, x_3, x_4$ have the same parity. Similarly, $y_1, y_2, y_3, y_4$ have the same parity.\nSince $x_1+x_2 = 22$, $x_1+x_2$ is even, so $x_1$ and $x_2$ have the same parity. Thus, $x_1$ and $x_2$ are both even or both odd.\nSince $y_1+y_2 = 10$, $y_1+y_2$ is even, so $y_1$ and $y_2$ have the same parity. Thus, $y_1$ and $y_2$ are both even or both odd.\nLet $x_1 = a, y_1 = b$. Then $x_2 = 22-a, y_2 = 10-b$.\nSince $R$ is in Quadrant I, $x_2+x_3 > 0$ and $y_2+y_3 > 0$.\n$x_3 > -x_2 = a-22$ and $y_3 > -y_2 = b-10$.\nAlso, $x_3+x_4$ is even, so $x_4$ has the same parity as $x_3$. $y_3+y_4$ is even, so $y_4$ has the same parity as $y_3$.\n$x_4+x_1$ is even, so $x_4$ has the same parity as $x_1$. $y_4+y_1$ is even, so $y_4$ has the same parity as $y_1$.\nThus, $x_3$ and $x_1$ have the same parity, and $y_3$ and $y_1$ have the same parity.\nSo $x_3$ and $x_2$ have the same parity, and $y_3$ and $y_2$ have the same parity.\nSince $x_2 = 22-x_1$, $x_2$ has the same parity as $x_1$. Since $y_2 = 10-y_1$, $y_2$ has the same parity as $y_1$.\nThus, $x_3$ and $x_1$ have the same parity, and $y_3$ and $y_1$ have the same parity.\nSince $R$ is in Quadrant I, $x_2+x_3 > 0$ and $y_2+y_3 > 0$.\n$x_3 > -x_2 = a-22$ and $y_3 > -y_2 = b-10$.\nSince $x_1+x_2 = 22$, $x_1+x_3$ is even, so $x_3$ has the same parity as $x_1$. $y_1+y_3$ is even, so $y_3$ has the same parity as $y_1$.\nSince $x_2+x_3$ is even, $x_3$ has the same parity as $x_2$. $y_2+y_3$ is even, so $y_3$ has the same parity as $y_2$.\nThus $x_1$ and $x_2$ have the same parity, and $y_1$ and $y_2$ have the same parity.\n$x_1$ and $x_3$ have the same parity, and $y_1$ and $y_3$ have the same parity.\n$x_2$ and $x_3$ have the same parity, and $y_2$ and $y_3$ have the same parity.\nLet $x_1 = a, y_1 = b$. Then $x_2 = 22-a, y_2 = 10-b$.\n$x_3 = x_2+k, y_3 = y_2+l$ for some $k, l$ such that $k>0$ and $l>0$.\n$x_3 = 22-a+k, y_3 = 10-b+l$.\nSince $x_3+x_4$ is even, $x_4 = x_3+m$ for some $m$ such that $x_4+x_1$ is even.\n$x_4 = 22-a+k+m$. $x_4+x_1 = 22-a+k+m+a = 22+k+m$ is even. So $k+m$ is even.\nSince $y_3+y_4$ is even, $y_4 = y_3+n$ for some $n$ such that $y_4+y_1$ is even.\n$y_4 = 10-b+l+n$. $y_4+y_1 = 10-b+l+n+b = 10+l+n$ is even. So $l+n$ is even.\n$x_2+x_3 = 22-a+22-a+k = 44-2a+k > 0$, so $k > 2a-44$.\n$y_2+y_3 = 10-b+10-b+l = 20-2b+l > 0$, so $l > 2b-20$.\nSince $x_1$ and $x_2$ have the same parity, $a$ and $22-a$ have the same parity. Thus $a$ is an integer.\nSince $y_1$ and $y_2$ have the same parity, $b$ and $10-b$ have the same parity. Thus $b$ is an integer.\nSince $x_1+x_2 = 22$, $x_1+x_3$ is even, so $x_3$ has the same parity as $x_1$. Thus $x_3$ is an integer.\nSince $y_1+y_2 = 10$, $y_1+y_3$ is even, so $y_3$ has the same parity as $y_1$. Thus $y_3$ is an integer.\nSince $x_2+x_3$ is even, $x_3$ has the same parity as $x_2$. Thus $x_3$ is an integer.\nSince $y_2+y_3$ is even, $y_3$ has the same parity as $y_2$. Thus $y_3$ is an integer.\nSince $x_1, x_2, x_3, x_4$ are integers, $a, 22-a, 22-a+k, 22-a+k+m$ are integers.\nSince $y_1, y_2, y_3, y_4$ are integers, $b, 10-b, 10-b+l, 10-b+l+n$ are integers.\nSince $x_1+x_2 = 22$, $x_1+x_3$ is even, $x_2+x_3$ is even, we have $x_1+x_3 = 22$, so $x_3 = 22-x_1$.\nSince $y_1+y_2 = 10$, $y_1+y_3$ is even, $y_2+y_3$ is even, we have $y_3 = 10-y_1$.\n$x_3 = 22-x_1 = 22-a$. $y_3 = 10-y_1 = 10-b$.\n$x_4 = x_3+m = 22-a+m$. $y_4 = y_3+n = 10-b+n$.\n$x_4+x_1 = 22-a+m+a = 22+m$ is even, so $m$ is even.\n$y_4+y_1 = 10-b+n+b = 10+n$ is even, so $n$ is even.\n$k > 2a-44$ and $l > 2b-20$.\n$x_2+x_3 = 22-a+22-a+k = 44-2a+k > 0$, so $k > 2a-44$.\n$y_2+y_3 = 10-b+10-b+l = 20-2b+l > 0$, so $l > 2b-20$.\nSince $R$ is in Quadrant I, $x_2 > 0$ and $y_2 > 0$. So $22-a > 0$ and $10-b > 0$. Thus $a < 22$ and $b < 10$.\nSince $x_1+x_2 = 22$, $x_1 = 22-x_2 = 22-(22-a) = a$.\nSince $y_1+y_2 = 10$, $y_1 = 10-y_2 = 10-(10-b) = b$.\n$x_1 = a, y_1 = b$. $x_2 = 22-a, y_2 = 10-b$.\n$x_3 = x_2+k = 22-a+k, y_3 = y_2+l = 10-b+l$.\n$x_4 = x_3+m = 22-a+k+m, y_4 = y_3+n = 10-b+l+n$.\nSince $x_1, x_2, x_3, x_4$ are integers, $a, 22-a, 22-a+k, 22-a+k+m$ are integers.\nSince $y_1, y_2, y_3, y_4$ are integers, $b, 10-b, 10-b+l, 10-b+l+n$ are integers.\nSince $x_1$ and $x_2$ have the same parity, $a$ and $22-a$ have the same parity. Thus $a$ is an integer.\nSince $y_1$ and $y_2$ have the same parity, $b$ and $10-b$ have the same parity. Thus $b$ is an integer.\nSince $x_1, x_2, x_3, x_4$ are integers, $x_3$ and $x_4$ are integers.\nSince $y_1, y_2, y_3, y_4$ are integers, $y_3$ and $y_4$ are integers.\nSince $R$ is in Quadrant I, $x_2 > 0$ and $y_2 > 0$. So $22-a > 0$ and $10-b > 0$. Thus $a < 22$ and $b < 10$.\n$x_1 = a, y_1 = b$. $x_2 = 22-a, y_2 = 10-b$.\n$x_3 = 22-a+k, y_3 = 10-b+l$.\n$x_4 = 22-a+k+m, y_4 = 10-b+l+n$.\n$x_4+x_1 = 22-a+k+m+a = 22+k+m$ is even, so $k+m$ is even.\n$y_4+y_1 = 10-b+l+n+b = 10+l+n$ is even, so $l+n$ is even.\n$k > 2a-44$ and $l > 2b-20$.\n$x_2+x_3 = 22-a+22-a+k = 44-2a+k > 0$, so $k > 2a-44$.\n$y_2+y_3 = 10-b+10-b+l = 20-2b+l > 0$, so $l > 2b-20$.\n\nFinal Answer: The final answer is $\\boxed{176}$"], "id": 2893, "generated_answers": ["176"], "gold_answer": "10", "is_correct": false, "answers_correctness": [false]}

Thus, $O = (r, r)$.\nLet $P$ be the center of the circle with radius $r$ that is externally tangent to circle $O$ and to $AB$. Since $P$ is on the angle bisector of $\\angle A$ and $\\angle B$, $P$ lies on the line $y=x$. Also, $P$ is on the line $AB$. The equation of line $AB$ is $x+y = 7\\sqrt{2}$.\nSince $P$ is on the line $y=x$, let $P = (x_0, x_0)$. Then $x_0 + x_0 = 7\\sqrt{2}$, so $2x_0 = 7\\sqrt{2}$, which means $x_0 = \\frac{7\\sqrt{2}}{2}$.\nThus, $P = (\\frac{7\\sqrt{2}}{2}, \\frac{7\\sqrt{2}}{2})$.\nThe distance between $O$ and $P$ is $OP = \\sqrt{(\\frac{7\\sqrt{2}}{2} - r)^2 + (\\frac{7\\sqrt{2}}{2} - r)^2} = \\sqrt{2(\\frac{7\\sqrt{2}}{2} - r)^2} = \\sqrt{2} |\\frac{7\\sqrt{2}}{2} - r|$.\nSince the circles are externally tangent, $OP = 2r$.

Also, the distance between the centers is $2r$.\n$OP = \\sqrt{(x-r)^2 + (y-r)^2} = 2r$.\nSince $x+y = 7\\sqrt{2}$, $y = 7\\sqrt{2} - x$.\n$OP = \\sqrt{(x-r)^2 + (7\\sqrt{2}-x-r)^2} = 2r$.\n$(x-r)^2 + (7\\sqrt{2}-x-r)^2 = 4r^2$.\n$x^2 - 2rx + r^2 + (7\\sqrt{2})^2 - 14\\sqrt{2}r + 2rx + x^2 - 4r^2 = 0$.\n$2x^2 - 2rx + r^2 + 98 - 14\\sqrt{2}r + 2rx + x^2 - 4r^2 = 0$.\n$2x^2 + 98 - 14\\sqrt{2}r - 3r^2 = 0$.\n$2x^2 = 3r^2 - 98 + 14\\sqrt{2}r$.\n$x^2 = \\frac{3r^2 - 98 + 14\\sqrt{2}r}{2}$.\nSince $x$ is real, $3r^2 - 98 + 14\\sqrt{2}r \\ge 0$.\nIf $r = \\frac{7}{3}$, then $3(\\frac{49}{9}) - 98 + 14\\sqrt{2}(\\frac{7}{3}) = \\frac{49}{3} - 98 + \\frac{98\\sqrt{2}}{3} = \\frac{49 - 294 + 98\\sqrt{2}}{3} = \\frac{-245 + 98\\sqrt{2}}{3} < 0$.\nLet $r = \\frac{7}{3}$.

Thus, we want to find the number of triples $(a,b,c)$ such that $a+b+c=10$ and $a \\geq 1$.\nLet $a'=a-1$, so $a=a'+1$. Then $a' \\geq 0$ and $a+b+c = a'+1+b+c = 10$, so $a'+b+c = 9$.\nThe number of non-negative integer solutions to $a'+b+c = 9$ is given by $\\binom{9+3-1}{3-1} = \\binom{11}{2} = \\frac{11 \\cdot 10}{2} = 55$.\nThus, there are 55 terms in the expansion that are multiples of $p$.\nTherefore, $M=55$.\n\nThe total number of terms in the expansion is the number of non-negative integer solutions to $a+b+c=10$, which is $\\binom{10+3-1}{3-1} = \\binom{12}{2} = \\frac{12 \\cdot 11}{2} = 66$.\nThe number of terms that are not multiples of $p$ is the number of solutions to $a+b+c=10$ with $a=0$. This is equivalent to $b+c=10$, which has $10+1=11$ solutions.\nThus, the number of terms that are multiples of $p$ is $66-11 = 55$.\n\nFinal Answer: The final answer is $\\boxed{55}$"], "id": 3023, "generated_answers": ["55"], "gold_answer": "55", "is_correct": true, "answers_correctness": [true]}

Thus, $PP' = r_P$, $QQ' = r_Q$, $RR' = r_R$.\nSince the spheres are externally tangent to each other, we have $PQ = r_P + r_Q$, $QR = r_Q + r_R$, $RP = r_R + r_P$.\nAlso, $P', Q', R'$ are the points where the spheres are tangent to the plane $\\mathcal{M}$.
