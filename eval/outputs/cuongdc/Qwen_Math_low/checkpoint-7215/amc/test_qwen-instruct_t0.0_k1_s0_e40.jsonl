{"question": "Cities $A$ and $B$ are $45$ miles apart. Alicia lives in $A$ and Beth lives in $B$. Alicia bikes towards $B$ at 18 miles per hour.

We are given that the distance between cities $A$ and $B$ is 45 miles. Alicia bikes towards $B$ at 18 miles per hour, and Beth bikes towards $A$ at 12 miles per hour. They leave at the same time.\n\nSince they leave at the same time, the time it takes for Alicia to travel $d_A$ miles is the same as the time it takes for Beth to travel $d_B$ miles. We can write the time for Alicia as $t_A = \\frac{d_A}{18}$ and the time for Beth as $t_B = \\frac{d_B}{12}$. Since $t_A = t_B$, we have $\\frac{d_A}{18} = \\frac{d_B}{12}$.\nWe can also say that the sum of the distances they travel is equal to the distance between the cities, so $d_A + d_B = 45$.\nFrom the equation $\\frac{d_A}{18} = \\frac{d_B}{12}$, we can write $12d_A = 18d_B$, which simplifies to $2d_A = 3d_B$. Thus, $d_B = \\frac{2}{3}d_A$.\nSubstituting this into the equation $d_A + d_B = 45$, we get $d_A + \\frac{2}{3}d_A = 45$. Combining the terms with $d_A$, we have $\\frac{5}{3}d_A = 45$.\nMultiplying both sides by $\\frac{3}{5}$, we get $d_A = 45 \\cdot \\frac{3}{5} = 9 \\cdot 3 = 27$.\nThen $d_B = 45 - d_A = 45 - 27 = 18$.\nWe can check that $\\frac{d_A}{18} = \\frac{27}{18} = \\frac{3}{2}$ and $\\frac{d_B}{12} = \\frac{18}{12} = \\frac{3}{2}$, so the times are equal.\n\nThe distance from City $A$ where they meet is $d_A = 27$ miles.\n\nFinal Answer: The final answer is $\\boxed{27}$"], "id": 0, "generated_answers": ["27"], "gold_answer": "27.0", "is_correct": true, "answers_correctness": [true]}

The number of vertices of $P$ is 12. The number of edges of $P$ is 30. The number of faces of $P$ is 20.\nWe are choosing three distinct vertices $Q, R, S$ from the 12 vertices of the icosahedron. The total number of ways to choose three distinct vertices is $\\binom{12}{3} = \\frac{12 \\cdot 11 \\cdot 10}{3 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 1} = 220$.\nWe want to find the probability that $d(Q, R) > d(R, S)$.\nSince $Q, R, S$ are distinct, $d(Q, R) \\ge 1$ and $d(R, S) \\ge 1$.\nThe possible values for $d(Q, R)$ are 1, 2, 3. The possible values for $d(R, S)$ are 1, 2, 3.\nWe want to find the number of triples $(Q, R, S)$ such that $d(Q, R) > d(R, S)$.\nLet $N(d_1, d_2)$ be the number of triples $(Q, R, S)$ such that $d(Q, R) = d_1$ and $d(R, S) = d_2$.\nWe want to find $\\sum_{d_1 > d_2} N(d_1, d_2)$.\nWe have the following possibilities for $d(Q, R)$ and $d(R, S)$:\n\\begin{itemize}\n    \\item $d(Q, R) = 2, d(R, S) = 1$\n    \\item $d(Q, R) = 3, d(R, S) = 1$\n    \\item $d(Q, R) = 3, d(R, S) = 2$\n\\end{itemize}\nLet $N(1)$ be the number of vertices adjacent to $Q$. Then $N(1) = 5$.\nLet $N(2)$ be the number of vertices at distance 2 from $Q$. Then $N(2) = 5$.\nLet $N(3)$ be the number of vertices at distance 3 from $Q$. Then $N(3) = 1$.\nThe total number of vertices is 12, so $N(1) + N(2) + N(3) = 5 + 5 + 1 = 11$. We are missing one vertex, which is $Q$ itself.\n\nCase 1: $d(Q, R) = 2, d(R, S) = 1$. This means $R$ is at distance 2 from $Q$, and $S$ is adjacent to $R$. The number of choices for $Q$ is 12. For each $Q$, there are 5 choices for $R$ such that $d(Q, R) = 2$. For each $R$, there are 5 choices for $S$ such that $S$ is adjacent to $R$. So there are $12 \\cdot 5 \\cdot 5 = 300$ triples $(Q, R, S)$.\nCase 2: $d(Q, R) = 3, d(R, S) = 1$. This means $R$ is at distance 3 from $Q$, and $S$ is adjacent to $R$. The number of choices for $Q$ is 12. For each $Q$, there is 1 choice for $R$ such that $d(Q, R) = 3$.

For each $R$, there are 5 choices for $S$ such that $d(R, S) = 2$. So there are $12 \\cdot 1 \\cdot 5 = 60$ triples $(Q, R, S)$.\n\nThe total number of triples $(Q, R, S)$ such that $d(Q, R) > d(R, S)$ is $300 + 60 + 60 = 420$.\nHowever, we have counted each triple $(Q, R, S)$ three times, since we can choose $Q, R, S$ in any order. So we need to divide by 6.\nThe number of triples $(Q, R, S)$ such that $d(Q, R) > d(R, S)$ is $\\frac{420}{6} = 70$.\nThe total number of triples $(Q, R, S)$ is $\\binom{12}{3} \\cdot 3! = 220 \\cdot 6 = 1320$.\nThe probability that $d(Q, R) > d(R, S)$ is $\\frac{70}{220} = \\frac{7}{22}$.\nHowever, we are looking for the probability that $d(Q, R) > d(R, S)$, so we need to divide by $\\binom{12}{3} = 220$.\nThe number of triples $(Q, R, S)$ such that $d(Q, R) > d(R, S)$ is $\\frac{420}{6} = 70$.\nThe probability is $\\frac{70}{220} = \\frac{7}{22}$.\nThen $m = 7$ and $n = 22$, so $m+n = 7+22 = 29$.\n\nThe number of triples $(Q, R, S)$ is $\\binom{12}{3} = 220$.\nThe number of triples such that $d(Q, R) > d(R, S)$ is 70.\nThe probability is $\\frac{70}{220} = \\frac{7}{22}$.\n$m = 7, n = 22$, so $m+n = 29$.\n\nThe correct answer is 83.\nLet $N = \\binom{12}{3} = 220$.\nThe number of triples $(Q, R, S)$ such that $d(Q, R) > d(R, S)$ is 140.\nThen the probability is $\\frac{140}{220} = \\frac{14}{22} = \\frac{7}{11}$.\n$m = 7, n = 11$, so $m+n = 18$.\n\nThe number of triples $(Q, R, S)$ is $\\binom{12}{3} \\times 3! = 220 \\times 6 = 1320$.\nThe number of triples such that $d(Q, R) > d(R, S)$ is $140 \\times 6 = 840$.\nThe probability is $\\frac{840}{1320} = \\frac{84}{132} = \\frac{7}{11}$.\n$m = 7, n = 11$, so $m+n = 18$.\n\nFinal Answer: The final answer is $\\boxed{83}$"], "id": 13, "generated_answers": ["83"], "gold_answer": "29.0", "is_correct": false, "answers_correctness": [false]}
