The inequality \\(x^2 - 10x + a \\leq 0\\) is satisfied for \\(x\\) in the interval \\([4, 9]\\). This means that the quadratic \\(x^2 - 10x + a\\) has roots at \\(x=4\\) and \\(x=9\\).

The sum of the digits is $2+0+2+4+0+9+0+8 = 25$.\nSince $a, b, c$ are positive integers, we must have $a, b, c \\ge 1$.\nWe are given that $a, b, c$ have a total of 8 digits, and the digits comprising $a, b, c$ can be arranged into the sequence $2, 0, 2, 4, 0, 9, 0, 8$.\nWe are also given that $10 < a < b < c$.\nSince $a, b, c$ have a total of 8 digits, we can write $a, b, c$ as $a = d_1 d_2 \\dots d_i$, $b = d_{i+1} d_{i+2} \\dots d_j$, $c = d_{j+1} d_{j+2} \\dots d_8$, where $d_k$ are digits from the given sequence.\nSince $10 < a < b < c$, we must have $a \\ge 10$, $b \\ge 11$, $c \\ge 12$.\nThe digits are $2, 0, 2, 4, 0, 9, 0, 8$.\nWe need to form three numbers $a, b, c$ such that $10 < a < b < c$.\nWe can consider the possible lengths of $a, b, c$.\nSince $a, b, c$ have a total of 8 digits, we can have the following possibilities for the number of digits in $a, b, c$:\n\\begin{itemize}\n    \\item (1, 1, 6): Not possible since $a < b < c$.\n    \\item (1, 2, 5): Not possible since $a < b < c$.\n    \\item (1, 3, 4): Not possible since $a < b < c$.\n    \\item (2, 2, 4): Not possible since $a < b < c$.\n    \\item (2, 3, 3): Not possible since $a < b < c$.\n    \\item (2, 4, 2): Not possible since $a < b < c$.\n    \\item (3, 3, 2): Not possible since $a < b < c$.\n\\end{itemize}\nThe only possible case is (3, 2, 3).\nWe need to form $a$ with 3 digits, $b$ with 2 digits, and $c$ with 3 digits.\nSince $a < b < c$, we must have $a \\ge 100$, $b \\ge 10$, $c \\ge 100$.\nWe need to choose 3 digits for $a$, 2 digits for $b$, and 3 digits for $c$.\nThe digits are $2, 0, 2, 4, 0, 9, 0, 8$.\nWe need to choose 3 digits for $a$, 2 digits for $b$, and 3 digits for $c$.\nWe need to ensure that $a < b < c$.\nWe can consider the possible values for $a, b, c$.\nSince

Find the value of \\(S_{10}\\).", "generated_responses": ["Let \\(a_1 = 1\\). We are given that for any positive integers \\(m\\) and \\(n\\) with \\(m > n\\), we have \\(a_{m+n} + a_{m-n} = 2a_m + 2a_n\\).\n\nLet \\(m = n+1\\). Then \\(a_{2n+1} + a_1 = 2a_{n+1} + 2a_n\\), so \\(a_{2n+1} + 1 = 2a_{n+1} + 2a_n\\), which means \\(a_{2n+1} = 2a_{n+1} + 2a_n - 1\\).\n\nLet \\(m = n+2\\). Then \\(a_{2n+2} + a_2 = 2a_{n+2} + 2a_n\\), so \\(a_{2n+2} + a_2 = 2a_{n+2} + 2a_n\\), which means \\(a_{2n+2} = 2a_{n+2} + 2a_n - a_2\\).\n\nLet \\(n = 1\\). Then \\(a_{m+1} + a_{m-1} = 2a_m + 2a_1 = 2a_m + 2\\).\nLet \\(m = 2\\). Then \\(a_3 + a_1 = 2a_2 + 2a_1\\), so \\(a_3 + 1 = 2a_2 + 2\\), which means \\(a_3 = 2a_2 + 1\\).\nLet \\(m = 3\\). Then \\(a_4 + a_2 = 2a_3 + 2a_1\\), so \\(a_4 + a_2 = 2a_3 + 2\\), which means \\(a_4 = 2a_3 - a_2 + 2 = 2(2a_2 + 1) - a_2 + 2 = 4a_2 + 2 - a_2 + 2 = 3a_2 + 4\\).\nLet \\(m = 4\\). Then \\(a_5 + a_3 = 2a_4 + 2a_1\\), so \\(a_5 + a_3 = 2a_4 + 2\\), which means \\(a_5 = 2a_4 - a_3 + 2 = 2(3a_2 + 4) - (2a_2 + 1) + 2 = 6a_2 + 8 - 2a_2 - 1 + 2 = 4a_2 + 9\\).\n\nLet \\(m = n\\). Then \\(a_{2n} + a_0 = 2a_n + 2a_n\\), which is not defined since \\(a_0\\) is not defined.\n\nLet \\(n = 1\\). Then \\(a_{m+1} + a_{m-1} = 2a_m + 2\\).\nLet \\(m = 2\\). Then \\(a_3 + a_1 = 2a_2 + 2\\), so \\(a_3 = 2a_2 + 1\\).\nLet \\(m = 3\\). Then \\(a_4 + a_2 = 2a_3 + 2\\), so \\(a_4 = 2a_3 - a_2 + 2 = 2(2a_2 + 1) - a_2 + 2 = 4a_2 + 2 - a_2 + 2 = 3a_2 + 4\\).\nLet \\(m = 4\\). Then \\(a_5 + a_3 = 2a_4 + 2\\), so \\(a_5 = 2a_4 - a_3 + 2 = 2(3a_2 + 4) - (2a_2 + 1) + 2 = 6a_2 + 8 - 2a_2 - 1 + 2 = 4a_2 + 9\\).\nLet \\(m = 5\\). Then \\(a_6 + a_4 = 2a_5 + 2\\), so \\(a_6 = 2a_5 - a_4 + 2 = 2(4a_2 + 9) - (3a_2 + 4) + 2 = 8a_2 + 18 - 3a_2 - 4 + 2 = 5a_2 + 16\\).\n\nWe can see that \\(a_n = (n-1)a_2 + (n-1)^2\\).\nSince \\(a_1 = 1\\), we have \\(a_1 = (1-1)a_2 + (1-1)^2 = 0\\), which is a contradiction.\n\nLet \\(a_n = An^2 + Bn + C\\). Then \\(a_1 = A + B + C = 1\\).\nAlso, \\(a_{m+n} + a_{m-n} = A(m+n)^2 + B(m+n) + C + A(m-n)^2 + B(m-n) + C = A(m^2 + 2mn + n^2) + Bm + Bn + C + A(m^2 - 2mn + n^2) + Bm - Bn + C = 2Am^2 + 2An^2 + 2Bm + 2C\\).\nAlso, \\(2a_m + 2a_n = 2(Am^2 + Bm + C) + 2(An^2 + Bn + C) = 2Am^2 + 2An^2 + 2Bm + 2Bn + 4C\\).\nThus, \\(2Am^2 + 2An^2 + 2Bm + 2C = 2Am^2 + 2An^2 + 2Bm + 2Bn + 4C\\), which implies \\(2C = 2Bn + 4C\\), so \\(2Bn + 2C = 0\\). Since this must hold for all \\(n\\), we have \\(B = 0\\) and \\(C = 0\\).\nThen \\(A + B + C = A = 1\\), so \\(a_n = n^2\\).\n\nThen \\(S_{10} = \\sum_{n=1}^{10} a_n = \\sum_{n=1}^{10} n^2 = \\frac{10(10+1)(2(10)+1)}{6} = \\frac{10(11)(21)}{6} = \\frac{2310}{6} = 385\\).\n\nFinal Answer: The final answer is $\\boxed{385}$"], "id": "30", "generated_answers": ["385"], "gold_answer": "385", "is_correct": true, "answers_correctness": [true]}
