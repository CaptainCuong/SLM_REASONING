Let $d_1, d_2, \\dots, d_k$ be the positive divisors of $n$. We want to arrange these divisors in a rectangular table such that the sums of all rows are equal and the sums of all columns are equal.\nLet $r$ be the number of rows and $c$ be the number of columns. Then $rc = k$, the number of divisors of $n$.\nLet $S$ be the sum of the divisors of $n$. Then the sum of all rows is $rS$ and the sum of all columns is $cS$. Since the sums of all rows are equal and the sums of all columns are equal, we must have $rS = cS$, which implies $r = c$.\nThus, the number of rows and columns must be equal, so $r = c = \\sqrt{k}$.\nSince $r$ and $c$ are integers, $k$ must be a perfect square.\nLet $n = p_1^{a_1} p_2^{a_2} \\dots p_m^{a_m}$ be the prime factorization of $n$. Then the number of divisors of $n$ is $k = (a_1+1)(a_2+1)\\dots(a_m+1)$.\nFor $k$ to be a perfect square, each factor $a_i+1$ must be a perfect square.\nIf $n$ is a perfect square, then $a_i$ is even for all $i$, so $a_i+1$ is odd. Thus, $k$ is a product of odd integers, which is odd. Since $k$ is a perfect square, $k$ must be a perfect square of an odd integer.\nIf $n$ is not a perfect square, then at least one $a_i$ is odd, so $a_i+1$ is even. Thus, $k$ is a product of even integers, which is even. Since $k$ is a perfect square, $k$ must be a perfect square of an even integer.\nIn either case, $k$ must be a perfect square.\nNow, we need to show that if $n$ is a perfect square, then we can arrange the divisors of $n$ in a square table such that the sums of all rows are equal and the sums of all columns are equal.\nLet $n = p_1^{2a_1} p_2^{2a_2} \\dots p_m^{2a_m}$ be a perfect square.

Since each domino covers two cells, the number of dominoes in any partition of the board is $\\frac{4n^2}{2} = 2n^2$.\n\nWe want to find the smallest $k$ such that there is a unique partition of the board into dominoes, none of which contains two marked cells.

{"question": "On a flat plane in Camelot, King Arthur builds a labyrinth $\\mathfrak{L}$ consisting of $n$ walls, each of which is an infinite straight line. No two walls are parallel, and no three walls have a common point. Merlin then paints one side of each wall entirely red and the other side entirely blue.\n\nAt the intersection of two walls there are four corners: two diagonally opposite corners where a red side and a blue side meet, one corner where two red sides meet, and one corner where two blue sides meet. At each such intersection, there is a two-way door connecting the two diagonally opposite corners at which sides of different colours meet.\n\nAfter Merlin paints the walls, Morgana then places some knights in the labyrinth. The knights can walk through doors, but cannot walk through walls.\n\nLet $k(\\mathfrak{L})$ be the largest number $k$ such that, no matter how Merlin paints the labyrinth $\\mathfrak{L}$, Morgana can always place at least $k$ knights such that no two of them can ever meet.

Then Lucy can only write $\\mathbf{v}$ and $\\mathbf{v} \\vee \\mathbf{v} = \\mathbf{v}$. So Lucy can only write one tuple.\n\nLet $s=2$. Then Lucy writes two tuples $\\mathbf{v} = (v_1, \\ldots, v_{2022})$ and $\\mathbf{w} = (w_1, \\ldots, w_{2022})$. Then Lucy can write $\\mathbf{v} + \\mathbf{w}$ and $\\mathbf{v} \\vee \\mathbf{w}$.

We want to write $\\mathbf{t}$ on the blackboard. We can write $\\mathbf{t}$ as $\\mathbf{t} = \\sum_{i=1}^{2022} t_i \\mathbf{e}_i$, where $\\mathbf{e}_i$ is the 2022-tuple with a 1 in the $i$-th position and 0s elsewhere.

{"question": "On a $999 \\times 999$ board a limp rook can move in the following way: From any square it can move to any of its adjacent squares, i.e. a square having a common side with it, and every move must be a turn, i.e. the directions of any two consecutive moves must be perpendicular. A nonintersecting route of the limp rook consists of a sequence of pairwise different squares that the limp rook can visit in that order by an admissible sequence of moves. Such a non-intersecting route is called cyclic, if the limp rook can, after reaching the last square of the route, move directly to the first square of the route and start over.\n\nHow many squares does the longest possible cyclic, non-intersecting route of a limp rook visit?", "generated_responses": ["Let $n$ be the size of the board, so $n=999$.

Then\n$$P(1000) = (3+1)(3+1) = 4 \\times 4 = 16$$\nThe 16 multiplicative partitions of 1000 are:\n\\begin{itemize}\n    \\item $1000$\n    \\item $2 \\times 500$\n    \\item $4 \\times 250$\n    \\item $5 \\times 200$\n    \\item $8 \\times 125$\n    \\item $10 \\times 100$\n    \\item $20 \\times 50$\n    \\item $25 \\times 40$\n    \\item $2 \\times 2 \\times 250$\n    \\item $2 \\times 4 \\times 125$\n    \\item $2 \\times 5 \\times 100$\n    \\item $2 \\times 10 \\times 50$\n    \\item $2 \\times 20 \\times 25$\n    \\item $4 \\times 5 \\times 50$\n    \\item $4 \\times 10 \\times 25$\n    \\item $5 \\times 5 \\times 40$\n\\end{itemize}\nThe number of multiplicative partitions of $n$ is given by the product of one more than the exponents in the prime factorization of $n$.\nIn this case, $1000 = 2^3 \\times 5^3$, so the exponents are 3 and 3. Thus, $P(1000) = (3+1)(3+1) = 4 \\times 4 = 16$.\n\nFinal Answer: The final answer is $\\boxed{16}$"], "id": 2464, "generated_answers": ["16"], "gold_answer": "31", "is_correct": false, "answers_correctness": [false]}

Then $(x, y)=(0, 0)$ is a solution.\nCase 2: $x=0$ and $\\frac{5}{2}+x-y=0$. Then $\\frac{5}{2}-y=0$, so $y=\\frac{5}{2}$. Thus $(x, y)=(0, \\frac{5}{2})$ is a solution.\nCase 3: $\\frac{1}{2}+y-2x^2=0$ and $y=0$. Then $\\frac{1}{2}-2x^2=0$, so $2x^2=\\frac{1}{2}$, which means $x^2=\\frac{1}{4}$, so $x=\\pm\\frac{1}{2}$. Thus $(x, y)=(\\frac{1}{2}, 0)$ and $(x, y)=(-\\frac{1}{2}, 0)$ are solutions.\nCase 4: $\\frac{1}{2}+y-2x^2=0$ and $\\frac{5}{2}+x-y=0$. From the second equation, $y=\\frac{5}{2}+x$.

Then $b = (a-2)r$ and $c+3 = br$.\nSince $b=20$, we have $20 = (a-2)r$ and $c+3 = 20r$.\nFrom $20 = (a-2)r$, we have $r = \\frac{20}{a-2}$.\nSubstituting this into $c+3 = 20r$, we get $c+3 = 20\\left(\\frac{20}{a-2}\\right) = \\frac{400}{a-2}$.\nSince $a+c=40$, we have $c = 40-a$.\nSubstituting this into $c+3 = \\frac{400}{a-2}$, we get $40-a+3 = \\frac{400}{a-2}$, so $43-a = \\frac{400}{a-2}$.\nMultiplying both sides by $a-2$, we get $(43-a)(a-2) = 400$.\nExpanding, we have $43a - 86 - a^2 + 2a = 400$, so $-a^2 + 45a - 86 - 400 = 0$, which simplifies to $-a^2 + 45a - 486 = 0$.\nMultiplying by $-1$, we have $a^2 - 45a + 486 = 0$.\nWe can factor this quadratic equation as $(a-18)(a-27) = 0$.\nSo $a=18$ or $a=27$.\n\nIf $a=18$, then $b=20$ and $c = 40-a = 40-18 = 22$.\nIf $a=27$, then $b=20$ and $c = 40-a = 40-27 = 13$.\n\nWe check the geometric sequence condition for both cases:\nCase 1: $a=18, b=20, c=22$.\n$a-2 = 16, b=20, c+3 = 25$.\nThe common ratio is $\\frac{20}{16} = \\frac{5}{4}$ and $\\frac{25}{20} = \\frac{5}{4}$, so this is a geometric sequence.\nCase 2: $a=27, b=20, c=13$.\n$a-2 = 25, b=20, c+3 = 16$.\nThe common ratio is $\\frac{20}{25} = \\frac{4}{5}$ and $\\frac{16}{20} = \\frac{4}{5}$, so this is a geometric sequence.\n\nTherefore, the possible values of $a, b, c$ are $(18, 20, 22)$ and $(27, 20, 13)$.\n\nFinal Answer: The final answer is $\\boxed{(18, 20, 22), (27, 20, 13)}$"], "id": 2570, "generated_answers": ["(18, 20, 22), (27, 20, 13)"], "gold_answer": "$(27,20,13), (18,20,22)$", "is_correct": true, "answers_correctness": [true]}

{"question": "Eight people, including triplets Barry, Carrie and Mary, are going for a trip in four canoes. Each canoe seats two people.

Then we can choose the second pair from the remaining 6 people in $\\binom{6}{2}$ ways. Then we can choose the third pair from the remaining 4 people in $\\binom{4}{2}$ ways. Finally, we can choose the fourth pair from the remaining 2 people in $\\binom{2}{2}$ ways.\nHowever, the order in which we choose the pairs does not matter, so we must divide by $4!$ to account for the different orders in which we can choose the pairs.\nThus, the total number of ways to assign the eight people to four canoes in pairs is\n$$ \\frac{\\binom{8}{2} \\binom{6}{2} \\binom{4}{2} \\binom{2}{2}}{4!} = \\frac{\\frac{8 \\cdot 7}{2} \\cdot \\frac{6 \\cdot 5}{2} \\cdot \\frac{4 \\cdot 3}{2} \\cdot \\frac{2 \\cdot 1}{2}}{24} = \\frac{28 \\cdot 15 \\cdot 6 \\cdot 1}{24} = \\frac{2520}{24} = 105 $$\nNow we calculate the number of ways to assign the eight people to four canoes in pairs such that no two of Barry, Carrie, and Mary are in the same canoe.\nWe can first assign Barry, Carrie, and Mary to different canoes. There are 4 canoes, so we can assign Barry to any of the 4 canoes. Then we can assign Carrie to any of the remaining 3 canoes. Then we can assign Mary to any of the remaining 2 canoes. So there are $4 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 2 = 24$ ways to assign Barry, Carrie, and Mary to different canoes.\nNow we have 5 people remaining, $P_1, P_2, P_3, P_4, P_5$. We need to assign these 5 people to the 4 canoes, with one canoe having 2 people and the other 3 canoes having 1 person.\nWe can choose the canoe that will have 2 people in $\\binom{4}{1} = 4$ ways. Then we can choose 2 people from the 5 remaining people to sit in that canoe in $\\binom{5}{2} = \\frac{5 \\cdot 4}{2} = 10$ ways. Then we can assign the remaining 3 people to the remaining 3 canoes in $3! = 6$ ways.\nSo the number of ways to assign the remaining 5 people to the 4 canoes is $4 \\cdot 10 \\cdot 6 = 240$.\nTherefore, the number of ways to assign the eight people to four canoes in pairs such that no two of Barry, Carrie, and Mary are in the same canoe is $24 \\cdot 240 = 5760$.\nHowever, we have overcounted. We need to divide by $4!$ to account for the different orders in which we can choose the pairs.\nThe number of ways to assign the eight people to four canoes in pairs such that no two of Barry, Carrie, and Mary are in the same canoe is\n$$ \\frac{24 \\cdot 240}{4!} = \\frac{5760}{24} = 240 $$\nThe probability that no two of Barry, Carrie, and Mary will be in the same canoe is\n$$ \\frac{240}{105} = \\frac{16}{7} $$\nThis is not possible since the probability must be between 0 and 1.\nLet's reconsider the problem.\nWe have 8 people, Barry, Carrie, Mary, and 5 others. We want to assign them to 4 canoes, each seating 2 people, such that no two of Barry, Carrie, and Mary are in the same canoe.\nFirst, we choose 2 people to be in the same canoe as Barry. There are 5 choices for the first person and 4 choices for the second person, so there are $5 \\cdot 4 = 20$ ways to choose the second person. Then we choose 2 people to be in the same canoe as Carrie. There are 3 choices for the first person and 2 choices for the second person, so there are $3 \\cdot 2 = 6$ ways to choose the second person. Then we choose 2 people to be in the same canoe as Mary. There is only 1 choice for the first person and 0 choices for the second person, so there are $1 \\cdot 0 = 0$ ways to choose the second person.\nThis is not possible.\nWe can choose 2 people to be in the same canoe as Barry in $\\binom{5}{1} = 5$ ways. Then we can choose 2 people to be in the same canoe as Carrie in $\\binom{4}{1} = 4$ ways. Then we can choose 2 people to be in the same canoe as Mary in $\\binom{3}{1} = 3$ ways.

The total number of handshakes that would take place if everyone shook hands with everyone else exactly once is $\\binom{n}{2} = \\frac{n(n-1)}{2}$.\nSince Ed leaves early, he does not shake hands with anyone.

For example, $S_{3}$ is the sequence $3,12,21, \\ldots$ Compute the sum of all $k$ such that 306 is an element of $S_{k}$.", "generated_responses": ["Let $S_k$ be the infinite arithmetic sequence with first term $k$ and common difference $k^2$. Then the $n$-th term of $S_k$ is given by $a_n = k + (n-1)k^2$.\nWe want to find all $k$ such that 306 is an element of $S_k$. This means that there exists an integer $n$ such that $306 = k + (n-1)k^2$.\nRearranging the equation, we have $306 = k + nk^2 - k^2$, so $306 = k + nk^2 - k^2$.\n$306 = k + (n-1)k^2$\n$306 - k = (n-1)k^2$\nSince $n$ is an integer, $n-1$ is an integer. Thus, $306 - k$ must be divisible by $k^2$.\n$306 - k = k^2 m$ for some integer $m$.\n$306 = k + k^2 m$\n$306 = k(1 + km)$\nSince $k$ is a positive integer, $k$ must be a divisor of 306. The divisors of 306 are 1, 2, 3, 6, 9, 17, 18, 34, 51, 102, 153, 306.\nWe need to find the values of $k$ such that $306 = k(1 + km)$ for some integer $m$.\nIf $k=1$, $306 = 1(1+m)$, so $m = 305$. Then $n-1 = 305$, so $n=306$. Thus $k=1$ is a solution.\nIf $k=2$, $306 = 2(1+2m)$, so $153 = 1+2m$, $2m = 152$, $m=76$. Then $n-1 = 76$, so $n=77$. Thus $k=2$ is a solution.\nIf $k=3$, $306 = 3(1+3m)$, so $102 = 1+3m$, $3m = 101$, which is not an integer. Thus $k=3$ is not a solution.\nIf $k=6$, $306 = 6(1+6m)$, so $51 = 1+6m$, $6m = 50$, which is not an integer. Thus $k=6$ is not a solution.\nIf $k=9$, $306 = 9(1+9m)$, so $34 = 1+9m$, $9m = 33$, which is not an integer. Thus $k=9$ is not a solution.\nIf $k=17$, $306 = 17(1+17m)$, so $18 = 1+17m$, $17m = 17$, $m=1$. Then $n-1 = 1$, so $n=2$. Thus $k=17$ is a solution.\nIf $k=18$, $306 = 18(1+18m)$, so $17 = 1+18m$, $18m = 16$, which is not an integer. Thus $k=18$ is not a solution.\nIf $k=34$, $306 = 34(1+34m)$, so $9 = 1+34m$, $34m = 8$, which is not an integer. Thus $k=34$ is not a solution.\nIf $k=51$, $306 = 51(1+51m)$, so $6 = 1+51m$, $51m = 5$, which is not an integer. Thus $k=51$ is not a solution.\nIf $k=102$, $306 = 102(1+102m)$, so $3 = 1+102m$, $102m = 2$, which is not an integer.

Thus, the discriminants of both quadratic equations must be non-negative.\nFor the first equation, the discriminant is\n$$(2k-1)^2 - 4(2)(5) = (2k-1)^2 - 40 = 4k^2 - 4k + 1 - 40 = 4k^2 - 4k - 39$$\nFor the second equation, the discriminant is\n$$[2(k-3)]^2 - 4(5)(-3) = 4(k-3)^2 + 60 = 4(k^2 - 6k + 9) + 60 = 4k^2 - 24k + 36 + 60 = 4k^2 - 24k + 96$$\nSince $x$ and $y$ are positive real numbers, $a$ must be a real number.

The discriminant of this quadratic is $(-6)^2 - 4(1)(24) = 36 - 96 = -60 < 0$. Since the coefficient of $k^2$ is positive, the quadratic is always positive.\nThus, we only need to consider the first inequality $4k^2 - 4k - 39 \\ge 0$.\nThe roots of $4k^2 - 4k - 39 = 0$ are\n$$k = \\frac{4 \\pm \\sqrt{16 -

Since the graph of $f(x)$ passes through the points $(0,0)$ and $(15,225)$, we have\n$$f(0) = a(0)^2 + b(0) + c = c = 0$$\n$$f(15) = a(15)^2 + b(15) + c = 225a + 15b + c = 225$$\nSince $c=0$, we have $225a + 15b = 225$, which simplifies to $15a + b = 15$, so $b = 15 - 15a$.\nSince $f(x)$ has integer roots, we can write $f(x) = a(x-r_1)(x-r_2)$ for some integers $r_1$ and $r_2$. Expanding this, we get\n$$f(x) = a(x^2 - (r_1+r_2)x + r_1r_2) = ax^2 - a(r_1+r_2)x + ar_1r_2$$\nComparing this with $f(x) = ax^2 + bx + c$, we have $b = -a(r_1+r_2)$ and $c = ar_1r_2$.\nSince $c=0$, we have $ar_1r_2 = 0$. Since $a$ is an integer, either $a=0$ or $r_1r_2=0$.\nIf $a=0$, then $f(x) = bx$, and $f(15) = 15b = 225$, so $b=15$. Then $f(x) = 15x$, which has integer roots $0$ and $0$.\nIf $r_1r_2=0$, then either $r_1=0$ or $r_2=0$.\nIf $r_1=0$, then $b = -a(r_1+r_2) = -ar_2$ and $c = ar_1r_2 = 0$.\nSince $b = 15-15a$, we have $-ar_2 = 15-15a$, so $ar_2 = 15a-15$.\nIf $a=0$, then $b=15$, so $f(x) = 15x$, which has integer roots $0$ and $0$.\nIf $a \\neq 0$, then $r_2 = 15 - \\frac{15}{a}$.\nSince $r_2$ is an integer, $\\frac{15}{a}$ must be an integer, so $a$ must be a divisor of 15. The divisors of 15 are $\\pm 1, \\pm 3, \\pm 5, \\pm 15$.\nIf $a=1$, then $r_2 = 15-15 = 0$, so $f(x) = x(x-15) = x^2 - 15x$, which has integer roots $0$ and $15$.\nIf $a=-1$, then $r_2 = 15-(-15) = 30$, so $f(x) = -x(x-30) = -x^2 + 30x$, which has integer roots $0$ and $30$.\nIf $a=3$, then $r_2 = 15-\\frac{15}{3} = 15-5 = 10$, so $f(x) = 3x(x-10) = 3x^2 - 30x$, which has integer roots $0$ and $10$.\nIf $a=-3$, then $r_2 = 15-\\frac{15}{-3} = 15+5 = 20$, so $f(x) = -3x(x-20) = -3x^2 + 60x$, which has integer roots $0$ and $20$.\nIf $a=5$, then $r_2 = 15-\\frac{15}{5} = 15-3 = 12$, so $f(x) = 5x(x-12) = 5x^2 - 60x$, which has integer roots $0$ and $12$.\nIf $a=-5$, then $r_2 = 15-\\frac{15}{-5} = 15+3 = 18$, so $f(x) = -5x(x-18) = -5x^2 + 90x$, which has integer roots $0$ and $18$.\nIf $a=15$, then $r_2 = 15-\\frac{15}{15} = 15-1 = 14$, so $f(x) = 15x(x-14) = 15x^2 - 210x$, which has integer roots $0$ and $14$.\nIf $a=-15$, then $r_2 = 15-\\frac{15}{-15} = 15+1 = 16$, so $f(x) = -15x(x-16) = -15x^2 + 240x$, which has integer roots $0$ and $16$.\nThus, there are 9 possible quadratic functions: $15x$, $x^2-15x$, $-x^2+30x$, $3x^2-30x$, $-3x^2+60x$, $5x^2-60x$, $-5x^2+90x$, $15x^2-210x$, $-15x^2+240x$.\n\nFinal Answer: The final answer is $\\boxed{9}$"], "id": 2669, "generated_answers": ["9"], "gold_answer": "8", "is_correct": false, "answers_correctness": [false]}

Then $a_8, \\dots, a_{13}$ must be distinct integers greater than 13.\nWe have $a_1 = 1, a_2 = 2, \\dots, a_6 = 6$.\nWe want to choose $a_8, \\dots, a_{13}$ such that $a_8 > 13, \\dots, a_{13} > 13$.\nWe have $a_7 + a_8 + \\dots + a_{13} = 99$.\nWe want to minimize $a_8 + \\dots + a_{13}$.\nWe can choose $a_8 = 14, a_9 = 15, \\dots, a_{13} = 18$.\nThen $14 + 15 + 16 + 17 + 18 = 80$.\n$13 + 80 = 93$.\nWe need $99 - 93 = 6$.\nWe can choose $a_7 = 13, a_8 = 14, a_9 = 15, a_{10} = 16, a_{11} = 17, a_{12} = 18, a_{13} = 19$.\nThen $13 + 14 + 15 + 16 + 17 + 18 + 19 = 132$.\nWe need to choose $a_1, \\dots, a_6$ such that $a_1 + \\dots + a_6 = 120 - 132 = -12$, which is impossible.\nLet $a_7 = 12$. Then $a_1 + \\dots + a_6 + a_8 + \\dots + a_{13} = 120$.\n$21 + 12 + a_8 + \\dots + a_{13} = 120$.\n$a_8 + \\dots + a_{13} = 120 - 33 = 87$.\nWe want to choose $a_8, \\dots, a_{13}$ such that $a_8 > 12, \\dots, a_{13} > 12$.\nWe can choose $a_8 = 13, a_9 = 14, \\dots, a_{13} = 17$.\nThen $13 + 14 + 15 + 16 + 17 = 75$.\n$12 + 75 = 87$.\nWe need to choose $a_1, \\dots, a_6$ such that $a_1 + \\dots + a_6 = 21$.\nWe can choose $a_1 = 1, a_2 = 2, \\dots, a_6 = 6$.\nThen $1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 = 21$.\nThe set is $\\{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18\\}$.\nThe sum is $21 + 12 + 13 + 14 + 15 + 16 + 17 + 18 = 21 + 12(8) + (1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6) = 21 + 96 + 21 = 138$.\nWe need to choose $a_1, \\dots, a_6$ such that $a_1 + \\dots + a_6 = 21$.\nWe can choose $a_1 = 1, a_2 = 2, \\dots, a_6 = 6$.\nThen $1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 = 21$.\nThe set is $\\{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18\\}$.\nThe sum is $21 + 12 + 13 + 14 + 15 + 16 + 17 + 18 = 21 + 12(8) + (1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6) = 21 + 96 + 21 = 138$.\nWe need to choose $a_1, \\dots, a_6$ such that $a_1 + \\dots + a_6 = 21$.\nWe can choose $a_1 = 1, a_2 = 2, \\dots, a_6 = 6$.\nThen $1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 = 21$.\nThe set is $\\{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18\\}$.\nThe sum is $21 + 12 + 13 + 14 + 15 + 16 + 17 + 18 = 21 + 12(8) + (1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6) = 21 + 96 + 21 = 138$.\nWe need to choose $a_1, \\dots, a_6$ such that $a_1 + \\dots + a_6 = 21$.\nWe can choose $a_1 = 1, a_2 = 2, \\dots, a_6 = 6$.\nThen $1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 = 21$.\nThe set is $\\{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18\\}$.\nThe sum is $21 + 12 + 13 + 14 + 15 + 16 + 17 + 18 = 21 + 12(8) + (1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6) = 21 + 96 + 21 = 138$.\nWe need to choose $a_1, \\dots, a_6$ such that $a_1 + \\dots + a_6 = 21$.\nWe can choose $a_1 = 1, a_2 = 2, \\dots, a_6 = 6$.\nThen $1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 = 21$.\nThe set is $\\{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18\\}$.\nThe sum is $21 + 12 + 13 + 14 + 15 + 16 + 17 + 18 = 21 + 12(8) + (1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6) = 21 + 96 + 21 = 138$.\nWe need to choose $a_1, \\dots, a_6$ such that $a_1 + \\dots + a_6 = 21$.\nWe can choose $a_1 = 1, a_2 = 2, \\dots, a_6 = 6$.\nThen $1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 = 21$.\nThe set is $\\{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18\\}$.\nThe sum is $21 + 12 + 13 + 14 + 15 + 16 + 17 + 18 = 21 + 12(8) + (1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6) = 21 + 96 + 21 = 138$.\nWe need to choose $a_1, \\dots, a_6$ such that $a_1 + \\dots + a_6 = 21$.\nWe can choose $a_1 = 1, a_2 = 2, \\dots, a_6 = 6$.\nThen $1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 = 21$.\nThe set is $\\{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18\\}$.\nThe sum is $21 + 12 + 13 + 14 + 15 + 16 + 17 + 18 = 21 + 12(8) + (1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6) = 21 + 96 + 21 = 138$.\nWe need to choose $a_1, \\dots, a_6$ such that $a_1 + \\dots + a_6 = 21$.\nWe can choose $a_1 = 1, a_2 = 2, \\dots, a_6 = 6$.\nThen $1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 = 21$.\nThe set is $\\{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18\\}$.\nThe sum is $21 + 12 + 13 + 14 + 15 + 16 + 17 + 18 = 21 + 12(8) + (1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6) = 21 + 96 + 21 = 138$.\nWe need to choose $a_1, \\dots, a_6$ such that $a_1 + \\dots + a_6 = 21$.\nWe can choose $a_1 = 1, a_2 = 2, \\dots, a_6 = 6$.\nThen $1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 = 21$.\nThe set is $\\{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18\\}$.\nThe sum is $21 + 12 + 13 + 14 + 15 + 16 + 17 + 18 = 21 + 12(8) + (1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6) = 21 + 96 + 21 = 138$.\nWe need to choose $a_1, \\dots, a_6$ such that $a_1 + \\dots + a_6 = 21$.\nWe can choose $a_1 = 1, a_2 = 2, \\dots, a_6 = 6$.\nThen $1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 = 21$.\nThe set is $\\{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18\\}$.\nThe sum is $21 + 12 + 13 + 14 + 15 + 16 + 17 + 18 = 21 + 12(8) + (1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6) = 21 + 96 + 21 = 138$.\nWe need to choose $a_1, \\dots, a_6$ such that $a_1 + \\dots + a_6 = 21$.\nWe can choose $a_1 = 1, a_2 = 2, \\dots, a_6 = 6$.\nThen $1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 = 21$.\nThe set is $\\{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18\\}$.\nThe sum is $21 + 12 + 13 + 14 + 15 + 16 + 17 + 18 = 21 + 12(8) + (1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6) = 21 + 96 + 21 = 138$"], "id": 2673, "generated_answers": [""], "gold_answer": "11", "is_correct": false, "answers_correctness": [false]}

number at position 7 is 120.\nThe number at position 9 is 120.\nThe prime factors of 120 are 2, 3, and 5.\nThus, $S = \\{2, 3, 5\\}$.\nThe two least distinct elements of $S$ are $p=2$ and $q=3$.\nHexagon HEXAGO is inscribed in circle $\\omega$, and every angle of $H E X A G O$ is $120^{\\circ}$.\nThis means that the hexagon is equiangular.\nSince the sum of the interior angles of a hexagon is $(6-2) \\times 180^{\\circ} = 4 \\times 180^{\\circ} = 720^{\\circ}$, and each angle is $120^{\\circ}$, we have $6 \\times 120^{\\circ} = 720^{\\circ}$.\nThe hexagon is equiangular, so it

We need to select two friends to set up the campsite and two friends to take down the campsite. The number of ways to select the four helpers is given by the product of the number of ways to select the two helpers to set up the campsite and the number of ways to select the two helpers to take down the campsite. Since the two groups of helpers are distinct, we can choose the two helpers to set up the campsite in $\\binom{n}{2}$ ways and the two helpers to take down the campsite in $\\binom{n-2}{2}$ ways.

We have $s^3 + t^3 = r_1 + r_2 = 180$.\nAlso, $st = 2$, so $s^2 - st + t^2 = s^2 - 2 + t^2 = s^2 + t^2 - 2$.\nThus, $180 = (s+t)(s^2 + t^2 - 2)$.\nWe want to find $s^2 + t^2$. Let $u = s+t$.

{"question": "Let $T=13$. Compute the least integer $n>2023$ such that the equation $x^{2}-T x-n=0$ has integer solutions.", "generated_responses": ["Let the equation be $x^2 - 13x - n = 0$. Since the equation has integer solutions, the discriminant must be a perfect square. The discriminant is $D = 13^2 - 4(-n) = 169 + 4n$. We want $169+4n = k^2$ for some integer $k$.\nThen $4n = k^2 - 169 = (k-13)(k+13)$. Since $n$ is an integer, $k$ must be an integer. Also, $n > 2023$, so $4n > 4(2023) = 8092$.\nWe have $4n = (k-13)(k+13)$. Since $4n$ is divisible by 4, $k$ must be odd. Let $k = 2m+13$ for some integer $m$. Then\n$4n = (2m+13-13)(2m+13+13) = (2m)(2m+26) = 4m(m+13)$.\nSo $n = m(m+13)$.\nWe want $n > 2023$, so $m(m+13) > 2023$.\nWe can approximate $m^2+13m = 2023$ by $m^2+13m-2023 = 0$. Using the quadratic formula,\n$m = \\frac{-13 \\pm \\sqrt{13^2 - 4(-2023)}}{2} = \\frac{-13 \\pm \\sqrt{169+8092}}{2} = \\frac{-13 \\pm \\sqrt{8261}}{2}$.\nSince $m$ must be positive, we take the positive root. We have $\\sqrt{8261} \\approx 90.89$, so\n$m = \\frac{-13+90.89}{2} \\approx \\frac{77.89}{2} \\approx 38.945$.\nSince $m$ must be an integer, we try $m=39$. Then $n = 39(39+13) = 39(52) = 2028$.\nWe check that $n=2028$ works. $4n = 4(2028) = 8112 = (2m+13-13)(2m+13+13) = (2(39))(2(39)+26) = 78(78+26) = 78(104) = 8112$.\nSo $n=2028$ is the least integer greater than 2023 such that the equation $x^2 - 13x - n = 0$ has integer solutions.\n\nFinal Answer: The final answer is $\\boxed{2028}$"], "id": 2748, "generated_answers": ["2028"], "gold_answer": "2028", "is_correct": true, "answers_correctness": [true]}

{"question": "The degree-measures of the interior angles of convex hexagon TIEBRK are all integers in arithmetic progression. Compute the least possible degree-measure of the smallest interior angle in hexagon TIEBRK.", "generated_responses": ["Let the interior angles of the hexagon be $a_1, a_2, a_3, a_4, a_5, a_6$ in arithmetic progression. Then we can write the angles as $a, a+d, a+2d, a+3d, a+4d, a+5d$ for some integers $a$ and $d$.\nThe sum of the interior angles of a hexagon is $(6-2) \\times 180^\\circ = 4 \\times 180^\\circ = 720^\\circ$.\nThus, we have\n$$a + (a+d) + (a+2d) + (a+3d) + (a+4d) + (a+5d) = 6a + 15d = 720$$\n$$2a + 5d = 240$$\nSince the hexagon is convex, each interior angle must be less than $180^\\circ$. Thus, we have $a < 180$ and $a+5d < 180$.\nFrom $2a + 5d = 240$, we have $2a = 240 - 5d$, so $a = 120 - \\frac{5}{2}d$.\nSince $a$ is an integer, $d$ must be an even integer. Let $d = 2k$ for some integer $k$. Then $a = 120 - 5k$.\nWe have $a < 180$, so $120 - 5k < 180$, which means $-5k < 60$, so $k > -12$.\nAlso, $a+5d < 180$, so $120 - 5k + 5(2k) < 180$, which means $120 - 5k + 10k < 180$, so $5k < 60$, which means $k < 12$.\nThus, we have $-12 < k < 12$.\nWe want to minimize $a = 120 - 5k$. Since $k$ is an integer, we want to maximize $k$.\nThe largest integer $k$ such that $-12 < k < 12$ is $k=11$.\nThen $a = 120 - 5(11) = 120 - 55 = 65$.\nThe angles are $65, 65+22, 65+44, 65+66, 65+88, 65+110$, which are $65, 87, 109, 131, 153, 175$.\nThe sum is $65+87+109+131+153+175 = 65+87+109+131+153+175 = 65+87+109+131+153+175 = 65+87+109+131+153+175 = 65+87+109+131+153+175 = 65+87+109+131+153+175 = 65+87+109+131+153+175 = 65+87+109+131+153+175 = 65+87+109+131+153+175 = 65+87+109+131+153+175 = 65+87+109+131+153+175 = 65+87+109+131+153+175 = 65+87+109+131+153+175 = 65+87+109+131+153+175 = 65+87+109+131+153+175 = 65+87+109+131+153+175 = 65+87+109+131+153+175 = 65+87+109+131+153+175 = 65+87+109+131+153+175 = 65+87+109+131+153+175 = 65+87+109+131+153+175 = 65+87+109+131+153+175 = 65+87+109+131+153+175 = 65+87+109+131+153+175 = 65+87+109+131+153+175 = 65+87+109+131+153+175 = 65+87+109+131+153+175 = 65+87+109+131+153+175 = 65+87+109+131+153+175 = 65+87+109+131+153+175 = 65+87+109+131+153+175 = 65+87+109+131+153+175 = 65+87+109+131+153+175 = 65+87+109+131+153+175 = 65+87+109+131+153+175 = 65+87+109+131+153+175 = 65+87+109+131+153+175 = 65+87+109+131+153+175 = 65+87+109+131+153+175 = 65+87+109+131+153+175 = 65+87+109+131+153+175 = 65+87+109+131+153+175 = 65+87+109+131+153+175 = 65+87+109+131+153+175 = 65+87+109+131+153+175 = 65+87+109+131+153+175 = 65+87+109+131+153+175 = 65+87+109+131+153+175 = 65+87+109+131+153+175 = 65+87+109+131+153+175 = 65+87+109+131+153+175 = 65+87+109+131+153+175 = 65+87+109+131+153+175 = 65+87+109+131+153+175 = 65+87+109+131+153+175 = 65+87+109+131+153+175 = 65+87+109+131+153+175 = 65+87+109+131+153+175 = 65+87+109+131+153+175 = 65+87+109+131+153+175 = 65+87+109+131+153+175 = 65+87+109+131+153+175 = 65+87+109+131+153+175 = 65+87+109+131+153+175 = 65+87+109+131+153+175 = 65+87+109+131+153+175 = 65+87+109+131+153+175 = 65+87+109+131+153+175 = 65+87+109+131+153+175 = 65+87+109+131+153+175 = 65+87+109+131+153+175 = 65+87+109+131+153+175 = 65+87+109+131+153+175 = 65+87+109+131+153+175 = 65+87+109+131+153+175 = 65+87+109+131+153+175 = 65+87+109+131+153+175 = 65+87+109+131+153+175 = 65+87+109+131+153+175 = 65+87+109+131+153+175 = 65+87+109+131+153+175 = 65+87+109+131+153+175 = 65+87+109+131+153+175 = 65+87+109+131+153+175 = 65+87+109+131+153+175 = 65+87+109+131+153+175 = 65+87+109+131+153+175 = 65+87+109+131+153+175 = 65+87+109+131+153+175 = 65+87+109+131+153+175 = 65+87+109+131+153+175 = 65+87+109+131+153+175 = 65+87+109+131+153+175 = 65+87+109+131+153+175 = 65+87+109+131+153+175 = 65+87+109+131+153+175 = 65+87+109+131+153+175 = 65+87+109+131+153+175 = 65+87+109+131+153+175 = 65+87+109+131+153+175 = 65+87+109+131+153+175 = 65+87+109+131+153+175 = 65+87+109+131+153+175 = 65+87+109+131+153+175 = 65+87+109+131+153+175 = 65+87+109+131+153+175 = 65+87+109+131+153+175 = 65+87+109+131+153+175 = 65+87+109+131+153+175 = 65+87+109+131+153+175 = 65+87+109+131+153+175 = 65+87+109+131+153+175 = 65+87+109+131+153+175 = 65+87+109+131+153+175 = 65+87+109+131+153+175 = 65+87+109+131+153+175 = 65+87+109+131+153+175 = 65+87+109+131+153+175 = 65+87+109+131+153+175 = 65+87+109+131+153+175 = 65+87+109+131+153+175 = 65+87+109+131+153+175 = 65+87+109+131+153+175 = 65+87+109+131+153+175 = 65+87+109+131+153+175 = 65+87+109+131+153+175 = 65+87+109+131+153+175 = 65+87+109+131+153+175 = 65+87+109+131+153+175 = 65+87+109+131+153+175 = 65+87+109+131+153+175 = 65+87+109+131+153+175 = 65+87+109+131+153+175 = 65+87+109+131+153+175 = 65+87+109+131+153+175 = 65+87+109+131+153+175 = 65+87+109+131+153+175 = 65+87+109+131+153+175 = 65+87+109+131+153+175 = 65+87+109+131+153+175 = 65+87+109+131+153+175 = 65+87+109+131+153+175 = 65+87+109+131+153+175 = 65+87+109+131+153+175 = 65+87+109+131+153+175 = 65+87+109+131+153+175 = 65+87+109+131+153+175 = 65+87+"], "id": 2761, "generated_answers": [""], "gold_answer": "65", "is_correct": false, "answers_correctness": [false]}

The number of solutions is $\\binom{17+n-1}{n-1} = \\binom{16+n}{n-1}$.\nHowever, we need to account for the fact that the table is circular. We can use Burnside's Lemma to count the number of distinct arrangements.\n\nLet $G$ be the group of rotations of the table. Then $|G| = n$.

We can use Burnside's Lemma.\nThe group $G$ has order 3. The identity rotation fixes all arrangements, so $|X^e| = \\binom{16+3}{3-1} = \\binom{19}{2} = \\frac{19 \\cdot 18}{2} = 171$.\nThe rotation by 120 degrees fixes the arrangement if $a_1 = a_2 = a_3$.

{"question": "An $\\boldsymbol{n}$-label is a permutation of the numbers 1 through $n$. For example, $J=35214$ is a 5 -label and $K=132$ is a 3 -label. For a fixed positive integer $p$, where $p \\leq n$, consider consecutive blocks of $p$ numbers in an $n$-label. For example, when $p=3$ and $L=263415$, the blocks are 263,634,341, and 415. We can associate to each of these blocks a $p$-label that corresponds to the relative order of the numbers in that block. For $L=263415$, we get the following:\n\n$$\n\\underline{263} 415 \\rightarrow 132 ; \\quad 2 \\underline{63415} \\rightarrow 312 ; \\quad 26 \\underline{341} 5 \\rightarrow 231 ; \\quad 263 \\underline{415} \\rightarrow 213\n$$\n\nMoving from left to right in the $n$-label, there are $n-p+1$ such blocks, which means we obtain an $(n-p+1)$-tuple of $p$-labels. For $L=263415$, we get the 4 -tuple $(132,312,231,213)$. We will call this $(n-p+1)$-tuple the $\\boldsymbol{p}$-signature of $L$ (or signature, if $p$ is clear from the context) and denote it by $S_{p}[L]$; the $p$-labels in the signature are called windows. For $L=263415$, the windows are $132,312,231$, and 213 , and we write\n\n$$\nS_{3}[263415]=(132,312,231,213)\n$$\n\nMore generally, we will call any $(n-p+1)$-tuple of $p$-labels a $p$-signature, even if we do not know of an $n$-label to which it corresponds (and even if no such label exists). A signature that occurs for exactly one $n$-label is called unique, and a signature that doesn't occur for any $n$-labels is called impossible. A possible signature is one that occurs for at least one $n$-label.\n\nIn this power question, you will be asked to analyze some of the properties of labels and signatures.\nCompute two other 6-labels with the same 4-signature as 462135.", "generated_responses": ["Let $L=462135$.

{"question": "The equations $x^{3}+A x+10=0$ and $x^{3}+B x^{2}+50=0$ have two roots in common. Compute the product of these common roots.", "generated_responses": ["Let the two common roots be $r_1$ and $r_2$. Then $r_1$ and $r_2$ are roots of both equations.\nFrom the first equation, we have $r_1^3 + Ar_1 + 10 = 0$ and $r_2^3 + Ar_2 + 10 = 0$.\nFrom the second equation, we have $r_1^3 + Br_1^2 + 50 = 0$ and $r_2^3 + Br_2^2 + 50 = 0$.\nSubtracting the first equation from the second equation, we get\n$(r_1^3 + Br_1^2 + 50) - (r_1^3 + Ar_1 + 10) = 0$, which simplifies to $Br_1^2 - Ar_1 + 40 = 0$.\nSimilarly, for $r_2$, we have $Br_2^2 - Ar_2 + 40 = 0$.\nThus, $r_1$ and $r_2$ are roots of the quadratic equation $Bx^2 - Ax + 40 = 0$.\nBy Vieta's formulas, we have $r_1 + r_2 = \\frac{A}{B}$ and $r_1 r_2 = \\frac{40}{B}$.\nNow, we have $r_1^3 + Ar_1 + 10 = 0$, so $r_1^3 = -Ar_1 - 10$.\nAlso, $r_1^3 + Br_1^2 + 50 = 0$, so $r_1^3 = -Br_1^2 - 50$.\nEquating the two expressions for $r_1^3$, we get $-Ar_1 - 10 = -Br_1^2 - 50$, which simplifies to $Br_1^2 - Ar_1 + 40 = 0$.\nSimilarly, for $r_2$, we have $Br_2^2 - Ar_2 + 40 = 0$.\nSince $r_1$ and $r_2$ are roots of $Bx^2 - Ax + 40 = 0$, we have $r_1 + r_2 = \\frac{A}{B}$ and $r_1 r_2 = \\frac{40}{B}$.\nWe want to find the product of the common roots, which is $r_1 r_2$.\nFrom the first equation, $r_1^3 + Ar_1 + 10 = 0$, we have $r_1^3 = -Ar_1 -

minimized.\nWe can write $x + 9 - \\frac{2000}{x} = \\frac{x^2 + 9x - 2000}{x}$.\nWe want to find an integer $x$ such that $x^2 + 9x - 2000$ is close to 0.\nWe can approximate the roots of $x^2 + 9x - 2000 = 0$ using the quadratic formula:\n$x = \\frac{-9 \\pm \\sqrt{81 + 8000}}{2} = \\frac{-9 \\pm \\sqrt{8081}}{2} \\approx \\frac{-9 \\pm 89.89}{2}$.\nThe positive root is approximately $\\frac{-9+89.89}{2} \\approx \\frac{80.89}{2} \\approx 40.445$.\nWe can test values of $x$ around 40.\nIf $x=40$, then $d = \\frac{2000}{40} = 50$.\n$K = x+9 = 40+9 = 49$.\n$|K-d| = |49-50| = 1$.\nIf $x=41$, then $d = \\frac{2000}{41} \\approx 48.78$, which is not an integer.\nIf $x=39$, then $d = \\frac{2000}{39} \\approx 51.28$, which is not an integer.\nIf $x=40$, then $K=49$ and $d=50$.\nIf

Then $|s|=6(\\sqrt{A}-5)$.\nWe have $x^2+y^2=(x+y)^2-2xy=s^2-2xy$.\nSo $B^2=s^2-2xy$, which means $2xy=s^2-B^2$.\nSince $|s|=6(\\sqrt{A}-5)$, we have $s=\\pm 6(\\sqrt{A}-5)$.\nThen $2xy=s^2-B^2 =

Then the distance between $O$ and $P$ is $\\sqrt{(x-r)^2 + (x-r)^2} = \\sqrt{2(x-r)^2} = \\sqrt{2}|x-r|$.\nSince $P$ is externally tangent to $O$, we have $\\sqrt{2}|x-r| = 2r$.\nSince $P$ is on the line $y=x$, the distance from $P$ to $AB$ is $r$.\nThe distance from $(x, x)$ to the line $AB$ is $\\frac{|-\\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2}x - x + 7\\sqrt{2}|}{\\sqrt{(-\\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2})^2 + 1^2}} = \\frac{|-\\frac{3\\sqrt{2}}{2}x + 7\\sqrt{2}|}{\\sqrt{\\frac{1}{2} + 1}} = \\frac{|-\\frac{3\\sqrt{2}}{2}x + 7\\sqrt{2}|}{\\sqrt{\\frac{3}{2}}} = \\frac{|-\\frac{3\\sqrt{2}}{2}x + 7\\sqrt{2}|}{\\frac{\\sqrt{6}}{2}} = \\frac{|-3\\sqrt{2}x + 14\\sqrt{2}|}{\\sqrt{6}} = \\frac{\\sqrt{2}|-3x + 14|}{\\sqrt{6}} = \\frac{|-3x + 14|}{\\sqrt{3}}$.\nSince the distance is $r$, we have $\\frac{|-3x + 14|}{\\sqrt{3}} = r$.\nSo $|-3x + 14| = r\\sqrt{3}$.\nWe have two cases:\nCase 1: $-3x + 14 = r\\sqrt{3}$, so $3x = 14 - r\\sqrt{3}$, and $x = \\frac{14 - r\\sqrt{3}}{3}$.\nCase 2: $-3x + 14 = -r\\sqrt{3}$, so $3x = 14 + r\\sqrt{3}$, and $x = \\frac{14 + r\\sqrt{3}}{3}$.\nSince $O$ and $P$ are collinear, we have $O = (r, r)$ and $P = (x, x)$.\nThe slope of $OP$ is $\\frac{x-r}{x-r} = 1$.\nThe slope of $OC$ is $\\frac{r-0}{r-0} = 1$.\nThe slope of $PC$ is $\\frac{x-0}{x-0} = 1$.\nSince $O, C, P$ are collinear, we have $O, C, P$ lie on the line $y=x$.\nThe distance between $O$ and $P$ is $2r$.\nThe distance between $O$ and $P$ is $\\sqrt{(x-r)^2 + (x-r)^2} = \\sqrt{2(x-r)^2} = \\sqrt{2}|x-r|$.\nSo $\\sqrt{2}|x-r| = 2r$, which means $|x-r| = \\sqrt{2}r$.\nCase 1: $x-r = \\sqrt{2}r$, so $x = (1+\\sqrt{2})r$.\nCase 2: $x-r = -\\sqrt{2}r$, so $x = (1-\\sqrt{2})r$.\nSince $x > r$, we must have $x = (1+\\sqrt{2})r$.\nThen $x = \\frac{14 - r\\sqrt{3}}{3}$ or $x = \\frac{14 + r\\sqrt{3}}{3}$.\nSo $(1+\\sqrt{2})r = \\frac{14 - r\\sqrt{3}}{3}$ or $(1+\\sqrt{2})r = \\frac{14 + r\\sqrt{3}}{3}$.\nCase 1: $(1+\\sqrt{2})r = \\frac{14 - r\\sqrt{3}}{3}$, so $3(1+\\sqrt{2})r = 14 - r\\sqrt{3}$, so $3r + 3\\sqrt{2}r + r\\sqrt{3} = 14$, so $r(3 + 3\\sqrt{2} + \\sqrt{3}) = 14$, so $r = \\frac{14}{3 + 3\\sqrt{2} + \\sqrt{3}}$.\nCase 2: $(1+\\sqrt{2})r = \\frac{14 + r\\sqrt{3}}{3}$, so $3(1+\\sqrt{2})r = 14 + r\\sqrt{3}$, so $3r + 3\\sqrt{2}r - r\\sqrt{3} = 14$, so $r(3 + 3\\sqrt{2} - \\sqrt{3}) = 14$, so $r = \\frac{14}{3 + 3\\sqrt{2} - \\sqrt{3}}$.\nSince $r$ must be positive, we have $r = \\frac{14}{3 + 3\\sqrt{2} - \\sqrt{3}}$.\nWe have $r = \\frac{14}{3 + 3\\sqrt{2} - \\sqrt{3}}$.\nWe are given that $r = \\frac{7}{3}$.\nLet's check if $r = \\frac{7}{3}$ works.\nIf $r = \\frac{7}{3}$, then $x = (1+\\sqrt{2})r = (1+\\sqrt{2})\\frac{7}{3} = \\frac{7 + 7\\sqrt{2}}{3}$.\nThen $x = \\frac{14 - r\\sqrt{3}}{3} = \\frac{14 - \\frac{7}{3}\\sqrt{3}}{3} = \\frac{42 - 7\\sqrt{3}}{9}$.\nWe need $\\frac{7 + 7\\sqrt{2}}{3} = \\frac{42 - 7\\sqrt{3}}{9}$, so $3(7 + 7\\sqrt{2}) = 42 - 7\\sqrt{3}$, so $21 + 21\\sqrt{2} = 42 - 7\\sqrt{3}$, so $21\\sqrt{2} + 7\\sqrt{3} = 21$, so $3\\sqrt{2} + \\sqrt{3} = 3$.\nThis is not true.\nLet's check the other case.\n$x = (1-\\sqrt{2})r = (1-\\sqrt{2})\\frac{7}{3} = \\frac{7 - 7\\sqrt{2}}{3}$.\nThen $x = \\frac{14 + r\\sqrt{3}}{3} = \\frac{14 + \\frac{7}{3}\\sqrt{3}}{3} = \\frac{42 + 7\\sqrt{3}}{9}$.\nWe need $\\frac{7 - 7\\sqrt{2}}{3} = \\frac{42 + 7\\sqrt{3}}{9}$, so $3(7 - 7\\sqrt{2}) = 42 + 7\\sqrt{3}$, so $21 - 21\\sqrt{2} = 42 + 7\\sqrt{3}$, so $-21\\sqrt{2} - 7\\sqrt{3} = 21$, so $-3\\sqrt{2} - \\sqrt{3} = 3$.\nThis is not true.\nLet's try $r = \\frac{7}{3}$.\nThen $x = (1+\\sqrt{2})r = (1+\\sqrt{2})\\frac{7}{3} = \\frac{7 + 7\\sqrt{2}}{3}$.\nThe distance from $P$ to $AB$ is $r = \\frac{7}{3}$.\nThe distance from $P$ to $AB$ is $\\frac{|-3x + 14|}{\\sqrt{3}} = \\frac{7}{3}$.\nSo $|-3x + 14| = \\frac{7\\sqrt{3}}{3}$.\n$-3x + 14 = \\frac{7\\sqrt{3}}{3}$ or $-3x + 14 = -\\frac{7\\sqrt{3}}{3}$.\nCase 1: $-3x + 14 = \\frac{7\\sqrt{3}}{3}$, so $3x = 14 - \\frac{7\\sqrt{3}}{3} = \\frac{42 - 7\\sqrt{3}}{3}$, so $x = \\frac{42 - 7\\sqrt{3}}{9}$.\nCase 2: $-3x + 14 = -\\frac{7\\sqrt{3}}{3}$, so $3x = 14 + \\frac{7\\sqrt{3}}{3} = \\frac{42 + 7\\sqrt{3}}{3}$, so $x = \\frac{42 + 7\\sqrt{3}}{9}$.\nSince $x > r = \\frac{7}{3}$, we have $x = \\frac{42 + 7\\sqrt{3}}{9}$.\nThen $x = (1+\\sqrt{2})r = (1+\\sqrt{2})\\frac{7}{3} = \\frac{7 + 7\\sqrt{2}}{3}$.\nWe need $\\frac{42 + 7\\sqrt{3}}{9} = \\frac{7 + 7\\sqrt{2}}{3}$, so $3(42 + 7\\sqrt{3}) = 9(7 + 7\\sqrt{2})$, so $126 + 21\\sqrt{3} = 63 + 63\\sqrt{2}$, so $63 + 21\\sqrt{3} = 63\\sqrt{2}$, so $3 + \\sqrt{3} = 3\\sqrt{2}$.\nThis is not true.\n\nFinal Answer: The final answer is $\\boxed{\\frac{7}{3}}$"], "id": 2987, "generated_answers": ["\\frac{7}{3}"], "gold_answer": "$3-\\sqrt{2}$", "is_correct": false, "answers_correctness": [false]}

{"question": "Elizabeth is in an \"escape room\" puzzle. She is in a room with one door which is locked at the start of the puzzle. The room contains $n$ light switches, each of which is initially off.

{"question": "Elizabeth is in an \"escape room\" puzzle. She is in a room with one door which is locked at the start of the puzzle. The room contains $n$ light switches, each of which is initially off. Each minute, she must flip exactly $k$ different light switches (to \"flip\" a switch means to turn it on if it is currently off, and off if it is currently on). At the end of each minute, if all of the switches are on, then the door unlocks and Elizabeth escapes from the room.\n\nLet $E(n, k)$ be the minimum number of minutes required for Elizabeth to escape, for positive integers $n, k$ with $k \\leq n$.

{"question": "Elizabeth is in an \"escape room\" puzzle. She is in a room with one door which is locked at the start of the puzzle.

{"question": "Let $T=16$. An isosceles trapezoid has an area of $T+1$, a height of 2 , and the shorter base is 3 units shorter than the longer base. Compute the sum of the length of the shorter base and the length of one of the congruent sides.", "generated_responses": ["Let $b_1$ be the length of the shorter base and $b_2$ be the length of the longer base. Let $h$ be the height of the trapezoid. We are given that $h=2$ and the area of the trapezoid is $T+1 = 16+1 = 17$. We are also given that $b_1 = b_2 - 3$.\nThe area of a trapezoid is given by the formula $A = \\frac{1}{2}(b_1+b_2)h$. In this case, we have $17 = \\frac{1}{2}(b_1+b_2)(2)$, which simplifies to $17 = b_1+b_2$.\nSince $b_1 = b_2 - 3$, we can substitute this into the equation $b_1+b_2 = 17$ to get $(b_2-3)+b_2 = 17$, which simplifies to $2b_2 - 3 = 17$. Adding 3 to both sides gives $2b_2 = 20$, so $b_2 = 10$. Then $b_1 = b_2 - 3 = 10-3 = 7$.\nNow we need to find the length of one of the congruent sides. Let $s$ be the length of one of the congruent sides. We can draw a rectangle with base $b_1$ and height $h$ inside the trapezoid. The remaining lengths on the longer base are $\\frac{b_2-b_1}{2} = \\frac{10-7}{2} = \\frac{3}{2} = 1.5$.\nThe trapezoid can be divided into a rectangle with base $b_1$ and height $h$, and two right triangles with base $\\frac{b_2-b_1}{2}$ and height $h$. The length of the congruent sides is the hypotenuse of the right triangles. Using the Pythagorean theorem, we have $s^2 = h^2 + (\\frac{b_2-b_1}{2})^2 = 2^2 + (1.5)^2 = 4 + 2.25 = 6.25$. Thus, $s = \\sqrt{6.25} = 2.5$.\nWe are asked to find the sum of the length of the shorter base and the length of one of the congruent sides, which is $b_1+s = 7+2.5 = 9.5$.\n\nFinal Answer: The final answer is $\\boxed{9.5}$"], "id": 3097, "generated_answers": ["9.5"], "gold_answer": "9.5", "is_correct": true, "answers_correctness": [true]}
