We want to find $a_{2017} - b_{2017}$.\n\nConsider the binary representation of integers from 1 to $2^n$. Each integer can be represented as a binary string of length at most $n$.\nFor example, if $n=3$, the integers from 1 to 8 are:\n1 = 001\n2 = 010\n3 = 011\n4 = 100\n5 = 101\n6 = 110\n7 = 111\n8 = 1000\n\nThe weight of an integer is the number of 1's in its binary representation.\nWe want to find the difference between the number of integers with even weight and the number of integers with odd weight.\nLet $a_n$ be the number of integers from 1 to $2^n$ with even weight, and $b_n$ be the number of integers from 1 to $2^n$ with odd weight. Then $a_n + b_n = 2^n$.\nConsider the integers from 1 to $2^{n+1}$. We can divide them into two groups: those with the $(n+1)$-th bit set to 0, and those with the $(n+1)$-th bit set to 1.\nThe integers with the $(n+1)$-th bit set to 0 are the integers from 1 to $2^n$. There are $a_n$ with even weight and $b_n$ with odd weight.\nThe integers with the $(n+1)$-th bit set to 1 are the integers from $2^n+1$ to $2^{n+1}$. The weight of these integers is the weight of the first $n$ bits plus 1. So, the number of integers with even weight is the number of integers from 1 to $2^n$ with odd weight, which is $b_n$. The number of integers with odd weight is the number of integers from 1 to $2^n$ with even weight, which is $a_n$.\nTherefore, $a_{n+1} = a_n + b_n$ and $b_{n+1} = b_n + a_n$.\nWe have $a_{n+1} = a_n + b_n = a_n + (2^n - a_n) = 2^n$.\n$b_{n+1} = b_n + a_n = (2^n - a_n) + a_n = 2^n$.\nHowever, this is incorrect.\nWe have $a_{n+1} = a_n + b_n$ and $b_{n+1} = b_n + a_n$.\nThen $a_{n+1} - b_{n+1} = (a_n + b_n) - (b_n + a_n) = 0$.\nThis is also incorrect.\nWe have $a_n + b_n = 2^n$.\nWe want to find $a_{n+1} - b_{n+1} = (a_n + b_n) - (b_n + a_n) = a_n - b_n$.\nWe have $a_{n+1} = a_n + b_n$ and $b_{n+1} = b_n + a_n$.\nThen $a_{n+1} - b_{n+1} = (a_n + b_n) - (b_n + a_n) = a_n - b_n$.\nLet $d_n = a_n - b_n$.

Let $d_1, d_2, \\dots, d_k$ be the positive divisors of $n$. We are given that these divisors can be put into a rectangular table such that each cell contains a distinct divisor, the sums of all rows are equal, and the sums of all columns are equal.\nLet $r$ be the number of rows and $c$ be the number of columns. Then $rc = k$, the number of divisors of $n$.\nLet $S$ be the sum of the divisors of $n$. Since the sums of all rows are equal, the sum of each row is $\\frac{S}{r}$. Since the sums of all columns are equal, the sum of each column is $\\frac{S}{c}$.\nSince the sum of each row is $\\frac{S}{r}$, we have $r$ copies of $\\frac{S}{r}$, so the total sum of all the numbers in the table is $r \\cdot \\frac{S}{r} = S$.\nAlso, since the sum of each column is $\\frac{S}{c}$, we have $c$ copies of $\\frac{S}{c}$, so the total sum of all the numbers in the table is $c \\cdot \\frac{S}{c} = S$.\nSince the sum of the divisors in each row is $\\frac{S}{r}$, we must have $\\frac{S}{r}$ be an integer. Similarly, since the sum of the divisors in each column is $\\frac{S}{c}$, we must have $\\frac{S}{c}$ be an integer.\nThus, $r$ divides $S$ and $c$ divides $S$. Since $rc = k$, we have $k$ divides $S$.\nWe know that $S = \\sigma(n)$, the sum of the divisors of $n$.\nWe are given that $n$ is a perfect number, so $\\sigma(n) = 2n$.\nThen $k$ divides $2n$. Since $k$ is the number of divisors of $n$, we have $k = \\tau(n)$.\nThus, $\\tau(n)$ divides $2n$.\nIf $n$ is a prime number $p$, then $\\tau(n) = 2$ and $2n = 2p$, so $2$ divides $2p$. In this case, the divisors are $1$ and $p$. We can put them in a $1 \\times 2$ table or a $2 \\times 1$ table.\nIf $n$ is a perfect number, then $\\sigma(n) = 2n$.

We have $10$ divides $992$, so $n=496$ works.\nLet $n = 8128$. Then $\\tau(8128) = 16$ and $\\sigma(8128) = 16256 = 2n$. We have $16$ divides $16256$, so $n=8128$ works.\nIf $n$ is an odd perfect number, then $\\tau(n)$ is odd, so $\\tau(n)$ cannot divide $2n$.\nIf $n = p^k$ for some prime $p$ and integer $k$, then $\\tau(n) = k+1$ and $\\sigma(n) = \\frac{p^{k+1}-1}{p-1}$. We need $k+1$ to divide $2 \\frac{p^{k+1}-1}{p-1}$.\nIf $k=1$, then $n=p$, $\\tau(n) = 2$, $\\sigma(n) = p+1$. We need $2$ to divide $2(p+1)$, which is true.\nIf $k=2$, then $n=p^2$, $\\tau(n) = 3$, $\\sigma(n) = \\frac{p^3-1}{p-1} = p^2+p+1$.

We define $\\ell(C)$ as the number of steps needed before all coins show tails (T). We want to show that $\\ell(C)$ is finite for any initial configuration $C$, and determine its average value over all $2^n$ possible initial configurations.\n\nFirst, we show that $\\ell(C)$ is finite. Let $k_i$ be the number of heads in the configuration after the $i$-th step. Initially, $k_0$ is the number of heads in the initial configuration $C$. In each step, we flip the $k_i$-th coin. If the $k_i$-th coin is heads, it becomes tails, so $k_{i+1} = k_i - 1$. If the $k_i$-th coin is tails, it becomes heads, so $k_{i+1} = k_i + 1$. However, we only flip the coin if $k_i > 0$.\nSince we only flip the coin if there are $k_i > 0$ heads, the number of heads can only decrease or stay the same. In particular, if the $k_i$-th coin is heads, we flip it to tails, so $k_{i+1} = k_i - 1$. If the $k_i$-th coin is tails, we do not flip it, so $k_{i+1} = k_i$. In either case, $k_{i+1} \\le k_i$.\nSince $k_i$ is the number of heads, $0 \\le k_i \\le n$. Thus, $k_i$ is a non-increasing sequence of integers between 0 and $n$. Since $k_i$ is an integer, it must eventually reach 0. Once $k_i = 0$, we stop the process. Therefore, the number of steps $\\ell(C)$ is finite.\n\nNow, we want to determine the average value of $\\ell(C)$ over all $2^n$ possible initial configurations.\nLet $E$ be the expected number of steps.

We have two initial configurations: H and T.\nIf $C = H$, then $\\ell(C) = 1$ (H $\\rightarrow$ T).\nIf $C = T$, then $\\ell(C) = 0$.\nSo, $E = \\frac{1}{2} (1+0) = \\frac{1}{2}$.\n\nConsider the case when $n=2$. We have four initial configurations: HH, HT, TH, TT.\nIf $C = HH$, then $\\ell(C) = 2$ (HH $\\rightarrow$ HT $\\rightarrow$ TT).\nIf $C = HT$, then $\\ell(C) = 1$ (HT $\\rightarrow$ TT).\nIf $C = TH$, then $\\ell(C) = 1$ (TH $\\rightarrow$ TT).\nIf $C = TT$, then $\\ell(C) = 0$.\nSo, $E = \\frac{1}{4} (2+1+1+0) = \\frac{4}{4} = 1$.\n\nConsider the case when $n=3$. We have eight initial configurations.\nIf $C = HHH$, then $\\ell(C) = 3$ (HHH $\\rightarrow$ HHT $\\rightarrow$ HTH $\\rightarrow$ HTT $\\rightarrow$ TTT).\nIf $C = HHT$, then $\\ell(C) = 2$ (HHT $\\rightarrow$ HTH $\\rightarrow$ HTT $\\rightarrow$ TTT).\nIf $C = HTH$, then $\\ell(C) = 2$ (HTH $\\rightarrow$ HTT $\\rightarrow$ TTT).\nIf $C = HTT$, then $\\ell(C) = 1$ (HTT $\\rightarrow$ TTT).\nIf $C = THH$, then $\\ell(C) = 2$ (THH $\\rightarrow$ THT $\\rightarrow$ TTT).\nIf $C = THT$, then $\\ell(C) = 2$ (THT $\\rightarrow$ TTH $\\rightarrow$ TTT).\nIf $C = TTH$, then $\\ell(C) = 1$ (TTH $\\rightarrow$ TTT).\nIf $C = TTT$, then $\\ell(C) = 0$.\nSo, $E = \\frac{1}{8} (3+2+2+1+2+2+1+0) = \\frac{13}{8} = 1.625$.\n\nWe can observe that the average number of steps is $n-1$.\nWe can prove this by induction.\nBase case: $n=1$. $E = \\frac{1}{2} = 1-1 = 0$.\nInductive step: Assume that for $n=k$, the average number of steps is $k-1$.\nFor $n=k+1$, we have $2^{k+1}$ initial configurations.\nLet $C$ be an initial configuration of length $k+1$. Let $x$ be the first coin.\nIf $x = H$, then we flip the $k$-th coin.\nIf $x = T$, then we do not flip the $k$-th coin.\nIn either case, the number of heads decreases or stays the same.\nThe expected number of steps is $E = \\frac{1}{2^{k+1}} \\sum_{C} \\ell(C)$.\nWe can write $\\ell(C) = 1 + \\ell(C')$, where $C'$ is the new configuration after the first step.\nThe expected number of steps is $E = \\frac{1}{2^{k+1}} \\sum_{C} (1 + \\ell(C')) = \\frac{1}{2^{k+1}} \\sum_{C} 1 + \\frac{1}{2^{k+1}} \\sum_{C} \\ell(C') = \\frac{2^{k+1}}{2^{k+1}} + \\frac{1}{2^{k+1}} \\sum_{C} \\ell(C') = 1 + \\frac{1}{2^{k+1}} \\sum_{C} \\ell(C')$.\nThe sum $\\sum_{C} \\ell(C')$ is the sum of the number of steps for all possible configurations after the first step.\nSince we flip the $k$-th coin if it is heads, the number of heads in the new configuration is $k-1$.\nThe expected number of steps is $E = 1 + \\frac{1}{2^{k+1}} \\sum_{C} \\ell(C')$.\nThe sum $\\sum_{C} \\ell(C')$ is the sum of the number of steps for all possible configurations after the first step.\nThe expected number of steps is $E = 1 + \\frac{1}{2^{k+1}} \\sum_{i=0}^{k+1} \\binom{k+1}{i} \\ell(C')$.\nThe expected number of steps is $E = 1 + \\frac{1}{2^{k+1}} \\sum_{i=1}^{k+1} \\binom{k+1}{i} (1 + \\ell(C'')) = 1 + \\frac{1}{2^{k+1}} \\sum_{i=1}^{k+1} \\binom{k+1}{i} + \\frac{1}{2^{k+1}} \\sum_{i=1}^{k+1} \\binom{k+1}{i} \\ell(C'')$.\nThe expected number of steps is $E = 1 + \\frac{2^{k+1}-1}{2^{k+1}} + \\frac{1}{2^{k+1}} \\sum_{i=1}^{k+1} \\binom{k+1}{i} \\ell(C'')$.\nThe expected number of steps is $E = 1 + 1 - \\frac{1}{2^{k+1}} + \\frac{1}{2^{k+1}} \\sum_{i=1}^{k+1} \\binom{k+1}{i} \\ell(C'')$.\nThe expected number of steps is $E = 2 - \\frac{1}{2^{k+1}} + \\frac{1}{2^{k+1}} \\sum_{i=1}^{k+1} \\binom{k+1}{i} \\ell(C'')$.\n\nThe average number of steps is $n-1$.\n\nFinal Answer: The final answer is $\\boxed{n-1}$"], "id": 1914, "generated_answers": ["n-1"], "gold_answer": "$\\frac{1}{4} n(n+1)$", "is_correct": false, "answers_correctness": [false]}

This implies that $a$ is divisible by $p$, so $a = kp$ for some positive integer $k$. Then $(kp)^p = b! + p$, so $k^p p^p = b! + p$. Since $b \\geq p$, $b!$ is divisible by $p^2$. Thus $k^p p^p - p = b!$ is divisible by $p^2$, so $p^2$ divides $p(k^p p^{p-1} - 1)$, which means $p$ divides $k^p p^{p-1} - 1$, so $p$ divides $-1$, which is a contradiction.\n\nTherefore, $b < p$.\nIf $b=1$, then $a^p = 1! + p = 1+p$. Since $a$ is a positive integer, $a^p > 1$, so $1+p > 1$, which is true for all $p > 0$. If $p=2$, then $a^2 = 1+2 = 3$, which has no integer solution for $a$. If $p=3$, then $a^3 = 1+3 = 4$, which has no integer solution for $a$. In general, $a^p = 1+p$, so $a = (1+p)^{1/p}$. Since $a$ is an integer, we must have $1+p$ be a perfect $p$-th power. But $1+p$ is between $1^p = 1$ and $2^p = 2^p$, so $1+p$ cannot be a perfect $p$-th power for $p > 1$. Thus, there are no solutions when $b=1$.\n\nIf $b=2$, then $a^p = 2! + p = 2+p$. If $p=2$, then $a^2 = 2+2 = 4$, so $a=2$. Thus $(a, b, p) = (2, 2, 2)$ is a solution. If $p=3$, then $a^3 = 2+3 = 5$, which has no integer solution for $a$. If $p=5$, then $a^5 = 2+5 = 7$, which has no integer solution for $a$. In general, $a^p = 2+p$, so $a = (2+p)^{1/p}$. Since $a$ is an integer, we must have $2+p$ be a perfect $p$-th power. But $2+p$ is between $2^p$ and $3^p$ for $p > 2$, so $2+p$ cannot be a perfect $p$-th power for $p > 2$. Thus, the only solution when $b=2$ is $(2, 2, 2)$.\n\nIf $b=3$, then $a^p = 3! + p = 6+p$. If $p=2$, then $a^2 = 6+2 = 8$, which has no integer solution for $a$. If $p=3$, then $a^3 = 6+3 = 9$, which has no integer solution for $a$. If $p=5$, then $a^5 = 6+5 = 11$, which has no integer solution for $a$. In general, $a^p = 6+p$, so $a = (6+p)^{1/p}$. Since $a$ is an integer, we must have $6+p$ be a perfect $p$-th power. But $6+p$ is between $2^p$ and $3^p$ for $p > 3$, so $6+p$ cannot be a perfect $p$-th power for $p > 3$.\n\nIf $p=2$, then $a^2 = b! + 2$. If $b=1$, then $a^2 = 1+2 = 3$, no integer solution. If $b=2$, then $a^2 = 2!+2 = 4$, so $a=2$. If $b=3$, then $a^2 = 3!+2 = 8$, no integer solution. If $b=4$, then $a^2 = 4!+2 = 26$, no integer solution. If $b=5$, then $a^2 = 5!+2 = 122$, no integer solution.\nIf $p=3$, then $a^3 = b! + 3$. If $b=1$, then $a^3 = 1+3 = 4$, no integer solution. If $b=2$, then $a^3 = 2!+3 = 5$, no integer solution. If $b=3$, then $a^3 = 3!+3 = 9$, no integer solution. If $b=4$, then $a^3 = 4!+3 = 27$, so $a=3$. Thus $(a, b, p) = (3, 4, 3)$ is a solution. If $b=5$, then $a^3 = 5!+3 = 123$, no integer solution.\n\nIf $p=5$, then $a^5 = b! + 5$. If $b=1, 2, 3, 4$, then $a^5 = 1, 2, 6, 29$, no integer solution. If $b=5$, then $a^5 = 5!+5 = 125$, so $a=5$.

Let $a+b = x$ and $c+d = y$. Then $x+y = 296$ and $xy = 2023$.\nWe have $x(296-x) = 2023$, which gives $296x - x^2 = 2023$, or $x^2 - 296x + 2023 = 0$.\nUsing the quadratic formula,\n$$ x = \\frac{296 \\pm \\sqrt{296^2 - 4(2023)}}{2} = \\frac{296 \\pm \\sqrt{87616 - 8092}}{2} = \\frac{296 \\pm \\sqrt{79524}}{2} = \\frac{296 \\pm 282}{2} $$\nSo $x = \\frac{296+282}{2} = \\frac{578}{2} = 289$ or $x = \\frac{296-282}{2} = \\frac{14}{2} = 7$.\nIf $x = 289$, then $y = 296-289 = 7$. If $x = 7$, then $y = 296-7 = 289$.\nThus, we have two cases:\nCase 1: $a+b = 289$ and $c+d = 7$. Since $a<b<c<d$, we must have $a+b > c+d$, which is $289 > 7$, so this case is possible.\nWe need to find the number of pairs $(a, b)$ such that $a<b$ and $a+b=289$. Also, we need to find the number of pairs $(c, d)$ such that $c<d$ and $c+d=7$.\nFor $a+b=289$, we have $a \\ge 1$, so $b = 289-a > a \\ge 1$. Thus $289-a > a$, so $289 > 2a$, or $a < 144.5$. Since $a$ is an integer, $1 \\le a \\le 144$.\nThe number of pairs $(a, b)$ is 144.\nFor $c+d=7$, we have $c \\ge 1$, so $d = 7-c > c \\ge 1$. Thus $7-c > c$, so $7 > 2c$, or $c < 3.5$. Since $c$ is an integer, $1 \\le c \\le 3$.\nThe number of pairs $(c, d)$ is 3.\nWe need $a<b<c<d$. Since $a+b=289$ and $c+d=7$, we have $a+b > c+d$, which is $289 > 7$.\nWe need to ensure $b<c$. Since $b=289-a$ and $c=7-d$, we need $289-a < 7+d$, so $282 < a+d$.\nSince $a \\ge 1$ and $d \\ge 1$, we have $a+d \\ge 2$. Thus $282 < a+d$ is always true.\nSo we have 144 choices for $(a, b)$ and 3 choices for $(c, d)$. The number of quadruples in this case is $144 \\times 3 = 432$.\n\nCase 2: $a+b = 7$ and $c+d = 289$.\nWe need to find the number of pairs $(a, b)$ such that $a<b$ and $a+b=7$. Also, we need to find the number of pairs $(c, d)$ such that $c<d$ and $c+d=289$.\nFor $a+b=7$, we have $a \\ge 1$, so $b = 7-a > a \\ge 1$. Thus $7-a > a$, so $7 > 2a$, or $a < 3.5$. Since $a$ is an integer, $1 \\le a \\le 3$.\nThe number of pairs $(a, b)$ is 3.\nFor $c+d=289$, we have $c \\ge 1$, so $d = 289-c > c \\ge 1$. Thus $289-c > c$, so $289 > 2c$, or $c < 144.5$. Since $c$ is an integer, $1 \\le c \\le 144$.\nThe number of pairs $(c, d)$ is 144.\nWe need $a<b<c<d$. Since $a+b=7$ and $c+d=289$, we have $a+b < c+d$, which is $7 < 289$.\nWe need to ensure $b<c$. Since $b=7-a$ and $c=289-d$, we need $7-a < 289+d$, so $-282 < a+d$.\nSince $a \\ge 1$ and $d \\ge 1$, we have $a+d \\ge 2$. Thus $-282 < a+d$ is always true.\nSo we have 3 choices for $(a, b)$ and 144 choices for $(c, d)$. The number of quadruples in this case is $3 \\times 144 = 432$.\n\nThe total number of quadruples is $432+432 = 864$.\nHowever, we are given that $a<b<c<d$.\nIn Case 1, $a+b=289$ and $c+d=7$. Since $a<b$ and $c<d$, we have $a \\le b$ and $c \\le d$. Thus $2a < 289$ so $a < 144.5$, and $2c < 7$ so $c < 3.5$.\nWe need $b<c$, so $289-a < 7+c$, which means $282 < a+c$.\nWe have $1 \\le a \\le 144$ and $1 \\le c \\le 3$.\nWe need $a+c > 282$. Since $a \\ge 1$ and $c \\ge 1$, $a+c \\ge 2$. We need $a+c > 282$.\nIf $c=1$, $a > 281$, which is impossible since $a \\le 144$.\nIf $c=2$, $a > 280$, which is impossible since $a \\le 144$.\nIf $c=3$, $a > 279$, which is impossible since $a \\le 144$.\nSo there are no solutions in this case.\n\nIn Case 2, $a+b=7$ and $c+d=289$. Since $a<b$ and $c<d$, we have $2a < 7$ so $a < 3.5$, and $2c < 289$ so $c < 144.5$.\nWe need $b<c$, so $7-a < c+d-c = d$, which means $7-a < d$.\nWe have $1 \\le a \\le 3$ and $1 \\le c \\le 144$.\nWe need $a+c < b+d$, so $a+c < 7+289-a-c$, which means $2(a+c) < 296$, so $a+c < 148$.\nIf $a=1$, $1+c < 148$, so $c < 147$. Since $1 \\le c \\le 144$, we have $1 \\le c \\le 144$.\nIf $a=2$, $2+c < 148$, so $c < 146$. Since $1 \\le c \\le 144$, we have $1 \\le c \\le 144$.\nIf $a=3$, $3+c < 148$, so $c < 145$. Since $1 \\le c \\le 144$, we have $1 \\le c \\le 144$.\nSo we have 3 choices for $a$ and 144 choices for $c$.

The sphere of radius $r=5$ is tangent to the three sides of the triangle.\nThe area of the triangle is $\\frac{1}{2}ab = \\frac{1}{2}(9)(12) = 54$.\nThe semiperimeter of the triangle is $s = \\frac{a+b+c}{2} = \\frac{9+12+15}{2} = \\frac{36}{2} = 18$.\nThe inradius of the triangle is given by the formula $r = \\frac{\\text{Area}}{s} = \\frac{54}{18} = 3$.\nHowever, we are given that the radius of the sphere is 5. This means that the sphere is not the inscribed circle of the triangle.\nLet $h$ be the height of the triangle with respect to the side $c$.

We are given that $100 \\leq n \\leq 999$, so $a$ can be any digit from 1 to 9, while $b$ and $c$ can be any digit from 0 to 9.\nWe want to find the probability that the sum of the digits of $n$ is 24, i.e., $a+b+c = 24$. Since $a \\leq 9$, $b \\leq 9$, and $c \\leq 9$, we must have $a, b, c \\leq 9$. Also, $a \\geq 1$.\nSince $a+b+c = 24$, we must have $a, b, c \\geq 0$. Also, $a \\leq 9$, $b \\leq 9$, and $c \\leq 9$.\nWe can rewrite the equation as $a+b+c = 24$. Since $a \\geq 1$, let $a' = a-1$, so $a = a'+1$.

Formally, a group assignment on $T$ is a function $f: T \\rightarrow\\{1,2, \\ldots, k\\}$, satisfying the condition that if $f\\left(r_{i}\\right)=f\\left(r_{j}\\right)$ for $i \\neq j$, then $r_{i}$ and $r_{j}$ do not know any of the same recipes. The group number of a town $T$, denoted $\\operatorname{gr}(T)$, is the least positive integer $k$ for which there exists a group assignment on $T$.\n\nFor example, consider once again the town of ARMLton.

{"question": "In each town in ARMLandia, the residents have formed groups, which meet each week to share math problems and enjoy each others' company over a potluck-style dinner. Each town resident belongs to exactly one group. Every week, each resident is required to make one dish and to bring it to his/her group.\n\nIt so happens that each resident knows how to make precisely two dishes. Moreover, no two residents of a town know how to make the same pair of dishes. Shown below are two example towns. In the left column are the names of the town's residents. Adjacent to each name is the list of dishes that the corresponding resident knows how to make.\n\n| ARMLton |  |\n| :--- | :--- |\n| Resident | Dishes |\n| Paul | pie, turkey |\n| Arnold | pie, salad |\n| Kelly | salad, broth |\n\n\n| ARMLville |  |\n| :--- | :--- |\n| Resident | Dishes |\n| Sally | steak, calzones |\n| Ross | calzones, pancakes |\n| David | steak, pancakes |\n\nThe population of a town $T$, denoted $\\operatorname{pop}(T)$, is the number of residents of $T$. Formally, the town itself is simply the set of its residents, denoted by $\\left\\{r_{1}, \\ldots, r_{\\mathrm{pop}(T)}\\right\\}$ unless otherwise specified. The set of dishes that the residents of $T$ collectively know how to make is denoted $\\operatorname{dish}(T)$. For example, in the town of ARMLton described above, pop(ARMLton) $=3$, and dish(ARMLton) $=$ \\{pie, turkey, salad, broth\\}.\n\nA town $T$ is called full if for every pair of dishes in $\\operatorname{dish}(T)$, there is exactly one resident in $T$ who knows how to make those two dishes. In the examples above, ARMLville is a full town, but ARMLton is not, because (for example) nobody in ARMLton knows how to make both turkey and salad.\n\nDenote by $\\mathcal{F}_{d}$ a full town in which collectively the residents know how to make $d$ dishes. That is, $\\left|\\operatorname{dish}\\left(\\mathcal{F}_{d}\\right)\\right|=d$.\n\nIn order to avoid the embarrassing situation where two people bring the same dish to a group dinner, if two people know how to make a common dish, they are forbidden from participating in the same group meeting. Formally, a group assignment on $T$ is a function $f: T \\rightarrow\\{1,2, \\ldots, k\\}$, satisfying the condition that if $f\\left(r_{i}\\right)=f\\left(r_{j}\\right)$ for $i \\neq j$, then $r_{i}$ and $r_{j}$ do not know any of the same recipes. The group number of a town $T$, denoted $\\operatorname{gr}(T)$, is the least positive integer $k$ for which there exists a group assignment on $T$.\n\nFor example, consider once again the town of ARMLton. A valid group assignment would be $f($ Paul $)=f($ Kelly $)=1$ and $f($ Arnold $)=2$. The function which gives the value 1 to each resident of ARMLton is not a group assignment, because Paul and Arnold must be assigned to different groups.\n\n\nFor a dish $D$, a resident is called a $D$-chef if he or she knows how to make the dish $D$. Define $\\operatorname{chef}_{T}(D)$ to be the set of residents in $T$ who are $D$-chefs. For example, in ARMLville, David is a steak-chef and a pancakes-chef. Further, $\\operatorname{chef}_{\\text {ARMLville }}($ steak $)=\\{$ Sally, David $\\}$.\n\n\nIf $\\operatorname{gr}(T)=\\left|\\operatorname{chef}_{T}(D)\\right|$ for some $D \\in \\operatorname{dish}(T)$, then $T$ is called homogeneous. If $\\operatorname{gr}(T)>\\left|\\operatorname{chef}_{T}(D)\\right|$ for each dish $D \\in \\operatorname{dish}(T)$, then $T$ is called heterogeneous. For example, ARMLton is homogeneous, because $\\operatorname{gr}($ ARMLton $)=2$ and exactly two chefs make pie, but ARMLville is heterogeneous, because even though each dish is only cooked by two chefs, $\\operatorname{gr}($ ARMLville $)=3$.\n\n\nA resident cycle is a sequence of distinct residents $r_{1}, \\ldots, r_{n}$ such that for each $1 \\leq i \\leq n-1$, the residents $r_{i}$ and $r_{i+1}$ know how to make a common dish, residents $r_{n}$ and $r_{1}$ know how to make a common dish, and no other pair of residents $r_{i}$ and $r_{j}, 1 \\leq i, j \\leq n$ know how to make a common dish. Two resident cycles are indistinguishable if they contain the same residents (in any order), and distinguishable otherwise.

Since the four marbles are sitting on the table, their centers are at a distance $r$ from the table. The center of the top marble is at a distance $r$ from the centers of the four marbles. The centers of the four marbles form a square in the $xy$-plane. Let the coordinates of the centers of the four marbles be $(\\pm a, \\pm a, r)$, where $a$ is the distance from the origin to each center in the $xy$-plane.

The coordinates of the centers of the four marbles are $(\\pm r, \\pm r, r)$.\nThe center of the top marble is at $(0,0, z_0)$, where $z_0$ is the height of the top marble. Since the top marble is tangent to the other four marbles, the distance between the center of the top marble and the center of any of the four marbles is $2r$. Thus, $z_0 - r = 2r$, so $z_0 = 3r$.\nThe center of the top marble is $(0,0, 3r)$. The vertices of the square base are $(\\pm r, \\pm r, r)$. The side length of the square base is $2r$.

{"question": "In ARMLopolis, every house number is a positive integer, and City Hall's address is 0.

Then $4t = n+3$, so $t = \\frac{n+3}{4}$.\nThen $\\lfloor t^2 \\rfloor = \\lfloor \\left(\\frac{n+3}{4}\\right)^2 \\rfloor = \\lfloor \\frac{n^2+6n+9}{16} \\rfloor = n$.\nThus, $n \\le \\frac{n^2+6n+9}{16} < n+1$.\nMultiplying by 16, we have $16n \\le n^2+6n+9 < 16n+16$.\nFrom $16n \\le n^2+6n+9$, we have $0 \\le n^2-10n+9 = (n-1)(n-9)$. Thus, $n \\le 1$ or $n \\ge 9$.\nFrom $n^2+6n+9 < 16n+16$, we have $n^2-10n-7 < 0$.\nThe roots of $n^2-10n-7=0$ are $n = \\frac{10 \\pm \\sqrt{100-4(-7)}}{2} = \\frac{10 \\pm \\sqrt{100+28}}{2} = \\frac{10 \\pm \\sqrt{128}}{2} = \\frac{10 \\pm 8\\sqrt{2}}{2} = 5 \\pm 4\\sqrt{2}$.\nSince $4\\sqrt{2} \\approx 4(1.414) = 5.656$, we have $5-4\\sqrt{2} \\approx -0.656$ and $5+4\\sqrt{2} \\approx 10.656$.\nThus, $5-4\\sqrt{2} < n < 5+4\\sqrt{2}$.\nSince $n$ is an integer, we have $-0.656 < n < 10.656$, so $n \\in \\{0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10\\}$.\nWe also have $n \\le 1$ or $n \\ge 9$.\nThus, $n \\in \\{0, 1, 9, 10\\}$.\nIf $n=0$, then $t = \\frac{0+3}{4} = \\frac{3}{4}$. Then $\\lfloor t^2 \\rfloor = \\lfloor (\\frac{3}{4})^2 \\rfloor = \\lfloor \\frac{9}{16} \\rfloor = 0$, which is consistent.\nIf $n=1$, then $t = \\frac{1+3}{4} = \\frac{4}{4} = 1$. Then $\\lfloor t^2 \\rfloor = \\lfloor 1^2 \\rfloor = \\lfloor 1 \\rfloor = 1$, which is consistent.\nIf $n=9$, then $t = \\frac{9+3}{4} = \\frac{12}{4} = 3$. Then $\\lfloor t^2 \\rfloor = \\lfloor 3^2 \\rfloor = \\lfloor 9 \\rfloor = 9$, which is consistent.\nIf $n=10$, then $t = \\frac{10+3}{4} = \\frac{13}{4} = 3.25$.

{"question": "An $\\boldsymbol{n}$-label is a permutation of the numbers 1 through $n$. For example, $J=35214$ is a 5 -label and $K=132$ is a 3 -label. For a fixed positive integer $p$, where $p \\leq n$, consider consecutive blocks of $p$ numbers in an $n$-label. For example, when $p=3$ and $L=263415$, the blocks are 263,634,341, and 415. We can associate to each of these blocks a $p$-label that corresponds to the relative order of the numbers in that block. For $L=263415$, we get the following:\n\n$$\n\\underline{263} 415 \\rightarrow 132 ; \\quad 2 \\underline{63415} \\rightarrow 312 ; \\quad 26 \\underline{341} 5 \\rightarrow 231 ; \\quad 263 \\underline{415} \\rightarrow 213\n$$\n\nMoving from left to right in the $n$-label, there are $n-p+1$ such blocks, which means we obtain an $(n-p+1)$-tuple of $p$-labels. For $L=263415$, we get the 4 -tuple $(132,312,231,213)$. We will call this $(n-p+1)$-tuple the $\\boldsymbol{p}$-signature of $L$ (or signature, if $p$ is clear from the context) and denote it by $S_{p}[L]$; the $p$-labels in the signature are called windows. For $L=263415$, the windows are $132,312,231$, and 213 , and we write\n\n$$\nS_{3}[263415]=(132,312,231,213)\n$$\n\nMore generally, we will call any $(n-p+1)$-tuple of $p$-labels a $p$-signature, even if we do not know of an $n$-label to which it corresponds (and even if no such label exists). A signature that occurs for exactly one $n$-label is called unique, and a signature that doesn't occur for any $n$-labels is called impossible. A possible signature is one that occurs for at least one $n$-label.\n\nIn this power question, you will be asked to analyze some of the properties of labels and signatures.\nCompute two other 6-labels with the same 4-signature as 462135.", "generated_responses": ["Let $L$ be a 6-label.

Thus, we have $a = 7$ and $a = \\frac{3+d}{2}$.\nTherefore, $7 = \\frac{3+d}{2}$, which gives $14 = 3+d$, so $d=11$.\nHowever, we are given that the foci are $(3,7)$ and $(d,7)$, so the distance between the foci is $|d-3|$.\nThe center of the ellipse is $\\left( \\frac{3+d}{2}, 7 \\right)$. Since the center is $(a,a)$, we have $\\frac{3+d}{2} = 7$, so $3+d = 14$, and $d=11$.\nThe distance from the center to each focus is $c$, so $c = \\left| 7 - \\frac{3+d}{2} \\right| = \\left| 7 - 7 \\right| = 0$. This is not possible.\n\nLet the center of the ellipse be $(h,k)$. Since the ellipse is tangent to the $x$-axis and $y$-axis, we have $h=k=a$, where $a$ is the length of the semi-major or semi-minor axis.\nThe foci are $(3,7)$ and $(d,7)$. The center of the ellipse is the midpoint of the foci, so $(h,k) = \\left( \\frac{3+d}{2}, 7 \\right)$.\nSince $h=k$, we have $\\frac{3+d}{2} = 7$, so $3+d = 14$, which gives $d=11$.\nSince the foci are $(3,7)$ and $(d,7)$, the distance between the foci is $|d-3|$.\nThe center of the ellipse is $\\left( \\frac{3+d}{2}, 7 \\right)$. Since the ellipse is tangent to the $x$-axis and $y$-axis, the center must be $(a,a)$.\nThus, $\\frac{3+d}{2} = 7$, so $3+d = 14$, and $d=11$.\nThe distance from the center to each focus is $c$, so $c = \\left| 7 - \\frac{3+d}{2} \\right| = |7-7| = 0$. This is not possible.\n\nLet the center of the ellipse be $(h,k)$. Since the ellipse is tangent to the $x$-axis and $y$-axis, we have $h=k=a$.\nThe foci are $(3,7)$ and $(d,7)$. The center is $\\left( \\frac{3+d}{2}, 7 \\right)$.\nSince the center is $(a,a)$, we have $a=7$ and $a = \\frac{3+d}{2}$. Thus, $7 = \\frac{3+d}{2}$, so $14 = 3+d$, and $d=11$.\nHowever, the distance between the foci is $2c = |d-3|$. Since $d=11$, $2c = |11-3| = 8$, so $c=4$.\nSince the center is $(7,7)$, we have $c=4$, so $a^2 = b^2 + c^2$, which means $7^2 = b^2 + 4^2$, so $49 = b^2 + 16$, and $b^2 = 33$.\nThe equation of the ellipse is $\\frac{(x-7)^2}{33} + \\frac{(y-7)^2}{49} = 1$.\nThe distance from the center to the focus is $c=4$. The foci are $(7 \\pm 4, 7)$, so the foci are $(3,7)$ and $(11,7)$.\nThus, $d=11$.\n\nHowever, the problem states that the ellipse is in the first quadrant and tangent to both axes. This means that the center of the ellipse is $(a,a)$ for some $a>0$.\nThe foci are $(3,7)$ and $(d,7)$. The center is $\\left( \\frac{3+d}{2}, 7 \\right)$.\nSince the center is $(a,a)$, we have $a=7$ and $a = \\frac{3+d}{2}$.

Thus, $7 = \\frac{3+d}{2}$, so $14 = 3+d$, and $d=11$.\nHowever, the distance from the center to the focus is $c$, so $c = \\left| 7 - \\frac{3+d}{2} \\right| = |7-7| = 0$.

If $d-3 = -8$, then $d=-5$.\nSince the ellipse is in the first quadrant, we must have $d>0$, so $d=11$.\n\nLet the center of the ellipse be $(h,k)$.

Then $|x+y| = r$, so $x+y = r$ or $x+y = -r$.\nWe are given $x^2+y^2 = B^2$.\nWe want to find the number of solutions to the system of equations $x+y = r$ and $x^2+y^2 = B^2$, and $x+y = -r$ and $x^2+y^2 = B^2$.\nFrom $x+y=r$, we have $y = r-x$. Substituting into $x^2+y^2=B^2$, we get $x^2+(r-x)^2 = B^2$, which gives $x^2 + r^2 - 2rx + x^2 = B^2$, so $2x^2 - 2rx + (r^2-B^2) = 0$.\nThe discriminant is $D = (-2r)^2 - 4(2)(r^2-B^2) = 4r^2 - 8(r^2-B^2) = 4r^2 - 8r^2 + 8B^2 = -4r^2 + 8B^2 = 4(2B^2-r^2)$.\nFor real solutions, we need $D \\ge 0$, so $2B^2 - r^2 \\ge 0$, which means $r^2 \\le 2B^2$.\nAlso, we are given that there are exactly two ordered pairs of real numbers that satisfy the given equations.\nThis means that either the equation $2x^2 - 2rx + (r^2-B^2) = 0$ has two distinct real solutions, or it has one real solution.\nIf $D > 0$, then we have two distinct real solutions for $x$. In this case, we must have $r^2 \\le 2B^2$.\nIf $D = 0$, then we have one real solution for $x$. In this case, we must have $r^2 = 2B^2$.\nSince there are exactly two ordered pairs of real numbers, we must have $r^2 < 2B^2$.\nIf $r^2 < 2B^2$, then we have two distinct real solutions for $x$.

Then the taxicab distance between two points $(x_1, y_1)$ and $(x_2, y_2)$ is $d((x_1, y_1), (x_2, y_2)) = |x_1 - x_2| + |y_1 - y_2|$.\nThe taxicab ellipse is defined by $d(A, Q) + d(B, Q) = s$.\nWe are given that the ellipse passes through $(1,-1)$. Thus, $d(A, (1,-1)) + d(B, (1,-1)) = s$.\n$d(A, (1,-1)) = |0-1| + |5-(-1)| = 1 + 6 = 7$.\n$d(B, (1,-1)) = |12-1| + |0-(-1)| = 11 + 1 = 12$.\nTherefore, $s = 7 + 12 = 19$.\nThe equation of the taxicab ellipse is $|x-0| + |y-5| + |x-12| + |y-0| = 19$.\n$|x| + |y-5| + |x-12| + |y| = 19$.\nWe want to find the area enclosed by this ellipse.\nLet's consider the case when $x \\ge 0$ and $x \\ge 12$.
