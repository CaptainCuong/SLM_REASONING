Each napkin covers a $52 \\times 52$ square.\nThe total number of cells is $2011^2$.\nThe number of cells covered by at least one napkin is at most $N \\cdot 52^2$.\nThe number of cells covered by exactly $i$ napkins is $c_i$.\nThen $\\sum_{i=1}^N c_i = 2011^2$.\nAlso, $\\sum_{i=1}^N i c_i \\le N \\cdot 52^2$.\nWe want to maximize $k = \\max_{i>0} c_i$.\n\nConsider the case where we place the napkins such that they do not overlap.

{"question": "Let $n$ be a positive integer. Harry has $n$ coins lined up on his desk, each showing heads or tails.

(For example, the process starting with THT would be THT $\\rightarrow H H T \\rightarrow H T T \\rightarrow T T T$, which takes three steps.)\n\nLetting $C$ denote the initial configuration (a sequence of $n H$ 's and $T$ 's), write $\\ell(C)$ for the number of steps needed before all coins show $T$. Show that this number $\\ell(C)$ is finite, and determine its average value over all $2^{n}$ possible initial configurations $C$.", "generated_responses": ["Let $C$ be an initial configuration of $n$ coins, where each coin is either heads (H) or tails (T). We define $\\ell(C)$ as the number of steps needed until all coins show tails. We want to show that $\\ell(C)$ is finite for any initial configuration $C$, and find the average value of $\\ell(C)$ over all $2^n$ possible initial configurations.\n\nFirst, we show that $\\ell(C)$ is finite. Let $k_i$ be the number of heads in the configuration after the $i$-th step. Initially, $k_0$ is the number of heads in $C$. In each step, we flip the $k_i$-th coin. If the $k_i$-th coin is heads, it becomes tails, so $k_{i+1} = k_i - 1$. If the $k_i$-th coin is tails, it becomes heads, so $k_{i+1} = k_i + 1$. However, we only flip the coin if $k_i > 0$.\nSince we only flip the $k_i$-th coin, we can consider the position of the heads. Let $h_1, h_2, \\dots, h_{k_i}$ be the positions of the heads in the configuration. In each step, we flip the coin at position $k_i$. If the coin at position $k_i$ is heads, it becomes tails, and $k_{i+1} = k_i - 1$. If the coin at position $k_i$ is tails, it becomes heads, and $k_{i+1} = k_i + 1$.\nSince we only flip the $k_i$-th coin, we can consider the number of heads in the first $k_i$ positions. Let $H_i$ be the number of heads in the first $k_i$ positions. Then $H_i \\le k_i$.\nIf the $k_i$-th coin is heads, we flip it to tails, so $H_{i+1} = H_i - 1$ and $k_{i+1} = k_i - 1$.\nIf the $k_i$-th coin is tails, we flip it to heads, so $H_{i+1} = H_i + 1$ and $k_{i+1} = k_i + 1$.\nWe want to show that $k_i$ eventually becomes 0. Suppose $k_i > 0$ for all $i$. Then we can consider the sequence $H_0, H_1, H_2, \\dots$. Since $H_i \\ge 0$ for all $i$, the sequence $H_i$ is non-increasing. Also, $H_i \\le k_i$ for all $i$.\nIf $H_i$ is constant, then $H_{i+1} = H_i$ for all $i$. This means that the $k_i$-th coin is always tails, so $k_{i+1} = k_i + 1$. But $k_i$ is increasing, which is a contradiction since $H_i$ is constant.\nTherefore, $H_i$ must be decreasing, so $H_i$ must eventually reach 0. When $H_i = 0$, we have $k_i = 0$, so the process stops.\nThus, $\\ell(C)$ is finite.\n\nNow, we find the average value of $\\ell(C)$ over all $2^n$ possible initial configurations.\nLet $A$ be the average value of $\\ell(C)$. We want to find $A = \\frac{1}{2^n} \\sum_{C} \\ell(C)$.\nConsider the case when $n=1$. Then $C$ can be either H or T. If $C=H$, then $\\ell(C) = 1$. If $C=T$, then $\\ell(C) = 0$. So $A = \\frac{1}{2}(1+0) = \\frac{1}{2}$.\nConsider the case when $n=2$. Then $C$ can be HH, HT, TH, TT. If $C=HH$, then $\\ell(C) = 2$. If $C=HT$, then $\\ell(C) = 1$. If $C=TH$, then $\\ell(C) = 1$. If $C=TT$, then $\\ell(C) = 0$. So $A = \\frac{1}{4}(2+1+1+0) = \\frac{4}{4} = 1$.\nConsider the case when $n=3$. Then $C$ can be HHH, HHT, HTH, HTT, THH, THT, TTH, TTT. If $C=HHH$, then $\\ell(C) = 3$. If $C=HHT$, then $\\ell(C) = 2$. If $C=HTH$, then $\\ell(C) = 2$. If $C=HTT$, then $\\ell(C) = 1$. If $C=THH$, then $\\ell(C) = 2$. If $C=THT$, then $\\ell(C) = 1$. If $C=TTH$, then $\\ell(C) = 1$. If $C=TTT$, then $\\ell(C) = 0$. So $A = \\frac{1}{8}(3+2+2+1+2+1+1+0) = \\frac{12}{8} = \\frac{3}{2}$.\nWe can observe that $A = \\frac{n}{2}$.\nWe can prove this by induction.\nBase case: $n=1$, $A = \\frac{1}{2}$.\nInductive step: Assume $A = \\frac{n}{2}$ for $n=k$. We want to show that $A = \\frac{k+1}{2}$ for $n=k+1$.\nLet $C$ be a configuration of length $k+1$. If the first coin is H, then we flip it to T. The remaining $k$ coins have an average of $\\frac{k}{2}$ steps. If the first coin is T, then we flip it to H. The remaining $k$ coins have an average of $\\frac{k}{2}$ steps.\nThe probability that the first coin is H is $\\frac{1}{2}$. The probability that the first coin is T is $\\frac{1}{2}$.\nSo $\\ell(C) = 1 + \\frac{1}{2} \\ell(C') + \\frac{1}{2} \\ell(C')$, where $C'$ is a configuration of length $k$.\nThen $\\ell(C) = 1 + \\ell(C')$.\nThe average value of $\\ell(C)$ is $\\frac{1}{2^{k+1}} \\sum_{C} \\ell(C) = \\frac{1}{2^{k+1}} \\sum_{C} (1 + \\ell(C')) = \\frac{1}{2^{k+1}} \\sum_{C} 1 + \\frac{1}{2^{k+1}} \\sum_{C} \\ell(C')$.\nThe first term is $\\frac{1}{2^{k+1}} \\cdot 2^{k+1} = 1$.\nThe second term is $\\frac{1}{2^{k+1}} \\sum_{C} \\ell(C') = \\frac{1}{2^{k+1}} \\cdot 2 \\sum_{C'} \\ell(C') = \\frac{2}{2^{k+1}} \\sum_{C'} \\ell(C') = \\frac{1}{2^k} \\sum_{C'} \\ell(C') = \\frac{1}{2^k} \\cdot 2^k \\cdot \\frac{k}{2} = \\frac{k}{2}$.\nSo $\\ell(C) = 1 + \\frac{k}{2} = \\frac{k+2}{2}$.\nThe average value is $\\frac{1}{2^{k+1}} \\sum_{C} \\ell(C) = 1 + \\frac{k}{2} = \\frac{k+2}{2}$.\nThe average value of $\\ell(C)$ is $\\frac{k+1}{2}$.\n\nFinal Answer: The final answer is $\\boxed{n/2}$"], "id": 1914, "generated_answers": ["n/2"], "gold_answer": "$\\frac{1}{4} n(n+1)$", "is_correct": false, "answers_correctness": [false]}

This implies that $a$ is divisible by $p$, so $a = kp$ for some integer $k$. Then $(kp)^p = b! + p$, so $k^p p^p = b! + p$. Thus $p(k^p p^{p-1} - 1) = b!$.

Then we have $k$ minutes where the Jury chooses an integer $i$ and $C_i$ pays one euro.\nAfter $k$ minutes, the positions of the contestants are $q_1, \\dots, q_n$.\nWe have $q_i - 1 \\geq i-1$ for $i=1, \\dots, n$.\nWe want to find the maximum value of $k$.\nLet $q_i$ be the position of contestant $C_i$ after $k$ minutes. Then $q_i = i - \\sum_{j=1}^k i_j$, where $i_j$ is the integer chosen at minute $j$.\nWe want to maximize $k$ such that $q_i - 1 \\geq i-1$ for all $i$.\nThis means $q_i \\geq i$ for all $i$.\nWe have $q_i = i - \\sum_{j=1}^k i_j$.\nSo $i - \\sum_{j=1}^k i_j \\geq i$, which means $\\sum_{j=1}^k i_j \\leq 0$. This is impossible.\nInstead, we want to maximize $k$ such that the process does not end.\nThe process ends when $q_i - 1 < i-1$ for some $i$. This means $q_i < i$.\nWe want to find the maximum number of euros collected before the process ends.\nLet $k$ be the number of euros collected. Then we have $k$ minutes.\nIn each minute, we choose an integer $i$ such that $q_i - 1 \\geq i-1$.\nAfter $k$ minutes, we have $q_i - 1 \\geq i-1$ for all $i$.\nWe want to find the maximum value of $k$.\nConsider the case where we choose $i=1$ at each minute. Then $q_1$ moves forward by 1 position each minute.\nWe want to find the maximum number of minutes we can do this.\nInitially, $q_1 = 1$. We can choose $i=1$ as long as $q_1 - 1 \\geq 1-1 = 0$.\nSo we can choose $i=1$ as long as $q_1 \\geq 1$.\nWe can choose $i=1$ for $n-1$ minutes. Then $q_1 = 1 - (n-1) = 2-n$.\nWe want $q_1 \\geq 1$, so $2-n \\geq 1$, which means $n \\leq 1$.\nIf $n=1$, we can choose $i=1$ for 0 minutes.\nIf $n=2$, we can choose $i=1$ for 1 minute. Then $q_1 = 1-1 = 0$, $q_2 = 2$.\nIf $n=3$, we can choose $i=1$ for 2 minutes. Then $q_1 = 1-2 = -1$, $q_2 = 2$, $q_3 = 3$.\nWe can choose $i=1$ for $n-1$ minutes. Then $q_1 = 1 - (n-1) = 2-n$.\nWe can choose $i=2$ for $n-2$ minutes. Then $q_2 = 2 - (n-2) = 4-n$.\nWe can choose $i=n$ for 1 minute. Then $q_n = n-1$.\nWe want to maximize the number of euros collected.\nConsider the case where we choose $i=1$ for $n-1$ minutes. Then $q_1 = 1 - (n-1) = 2-n$.\nWe want $q_1 \\geq 1$, so $2-n \\geq 1$, which means $n \\leq 1$.\nIf we choose $i=1$ for $n-1$ minutes, then $q_1 = 2-n$, $q_2 = 2$, $q_3 = 3, \\dots, q_n = n$.\nIf $n=2$, we choose $i=1$ for 1 minute. Then $q_1 = 0$, $q_2 = 2$. The process ends.\nIf $n=3$, we choose $i=1$ for 2 minutes. Then $q_1 = -1$, $q_2 = 2$, $q_3 = 3$. The process ends.\nWe can choose $i=1$ for $n-1$ minutes. Then $q_1 = 2-n$.\nWe can choose $i=2$ for $n-2$ minutes. Then $q_2 = 4-n$.\nWe can choose $i=n$ for 1 minute. Then $q_n = n-1$.\nThe total number of euros collected is $\\sum_{i=1}^n i \\cdot \\text{number of times } i \\text{ is chosen}$.\nWe want to maximize the number of euros collected.\nThe maximum number of euros collected is $\\lfloor \\frac{n}{2} \\rfloor$.\n\nFinal Answer: The final answer is $\\boxed{\\lfloor \\frac{n}{2} \\rfloor}$"], "id": 2198, "generated_answers": ["\\lfloor \\frac{n}{2} \\rfloor"], "gold_answer": "$2^{n}-n-1$", "is_correct": false, "answers_correctness": [false]}

Let $ab = k^2$ for some integer $k$.\nThen $\\sqrt{ab} = k$, so $a + b + 2k = 50$, which means $a + b = 50 - 2k$.\nAlso, $ab = k^2$.\nThus, $a$ and $b$ are the roots of the quadratic equation $x^2 - (50-2k)x + k^2 = 0$.\nThe discriminant of this quadratic equation is\n$$(50-2k)^2 - 4k^2 = 2500 - 200k + 4k^2 - 4k^2 = 2500 - 200k$$\nFor $a$ and $b$ to be real numbers, the discriminant must be non-negative, so $2500 - 200k \\ge 0$, which means $200k \\le 2500$, or $k \\le \\frac{2500}{200} = \\frac{250}{20} = \\frac{25}{2} = 12.5$.\nSince $k$ is an integer, we must have $k \\le 12$.\nAlso, since $a$ and $b$ are positive integers, we must have $k > 0$.\nSince $a$ and $b$ are positive integers, the discriminant must be a perfect square.\nLet $2500 - 200k = m^2$ for some integer $m$.\nThen $2500 - m^2 = 200k$, so $k = \\frac{2500 - m^2}{200} = \\frac{2500}{200} - \\frac{m^2}{200} = 12.5 - \\frac{m^2}{200}$.\nSince $k$ is an integer, $m^2$ must be divisible by $200 = 2^3 \\cdot 5^2$.\nThus, $m^2$ must be divisible by $2^3$ and $5^2$.\nSince $m^2$ is divisible by $2^3$, $m$ must be divisible by $2^2 = 4$.\nSince $m^2$ is divisible by $5^2$, $m$ must be divisible by $5$.\nThus, $m$ must be divisible by $20$.\nLet $m = 20n$ for some integer $n$.\nThen $m^2 = 400n^2$, and $k = 12.5 - \\frac{400n^2}{200} = 12.5 - 2n^2$.\nSince $k$ is an integer, $12.5 - 2n^2$ must be an integer, which means $2n^2$ must be of the form $12.5 - \\text{integer}$, which is impossible.\nHowever, we need $k$ to be an integer, so $12.5 - 2n^2$ must be an integer. This means $2n^2$ must be of the form $12.5 - \\text{integer}$, which is impossible.\nInstead, we need $2500 - 200k$ to be a perfect square, say $m^2$.\nThen $2500 - m^2 = 200k$, so $k = \\frac{2500 -

The group number of a town $T$, denoted $\\operatorname{gr}(T)$, is the least positive integer $k$ for which there exists a group assignment on $T$.\n\nFor example, consider once again the town of ARMLton. A valid group assignment would be $f($ Paul $)=f($ Kelly $)=1$ and $f($ Arnold $)=2$. The function which gives the value 1 to each resident of ARMLton is not a group assignment, because Paul and Arnold must be assigned to different groups.\n\n\nFor a dish $D$, a resident is called a $D$-chef if he or she knows how to make the dish $D$. Define $\\operatorname{chef}_{T}(D)$ to be the set of residents in $T$ who are $D$-chefs. For example, in ARMLville, David is a steak-chef and a pancakes-chef. Further, $\\operatorname{chef}_{\\text {ARMLville }}($ steak $)=\\{$ Sally, David $\\}$.\n\n\nIf $\\operatorname{gr}(T)=\\left|\\operatorname{chef}_{T}(D)\\right|$ for some $D \\in \\operatorname{dish}(T)$, then $T$ is called homogeneous. If $\\operatorname{gr}(T)>\\left|\\operatorname{chef}_{T}(D)\\right|$ for each dish $D \\in \\operatorname{dish}(T)$, then $T$ is called heterogeneous. For example, ARMLton is homogeneous, because $\\operatorname{gr}($ ARMLton $)=2$ and exactly two chefs make pie, but ARMLville is heterogeneous, because even though each dish is only cooked by two chefs, $\\operatorname{gr}($ ARMLville $)=3$.\n\n\nA resident cycle is a sequence of distinct residents $r_{1}, \\ldots, r_{n}$ such that for each $1 \\leq i \\leq n-1$, the residents $r_{i}$ and $r_{i+1}$ know how to make a common dish, residents $r_{n}$ and $r_{1}$ know how to make a common dish, and no other pair of residents $r_{i}$ and $r_{j}, 1 \\leq i, j \\leq n$ know how to make a common dish. Two resident cycles are indistinguishable if they contain the same residents (in any order), and distinguishable otherwise. For example, if $r_{1}, r_{2}, r_{3}, r_{4}$ is a resident cycle, then $r_{2}, r_{1}, r_{4}, r_{3}$ and $r_{3}, r_{2}, r_{1}, r_{4}$ are indistinguishable resident cycles.\nIn terms of $k$ and $d$, find the number of distinguishable resident cycles of length $k$ in $\\mathcal{F}_{d}$.", "generated_responses": ["Let $T$ be a full town with $d$ dishes.

We need $k$ to be a divisor of 306.\nThe divisors of 306 are 1, 2, 3, 6, 9, 17, 18, 34, 51, 102, 153, 306.\nWe need $1+nk = \\frac{306}{k}$, so $n = \\frac{306}{k} - \\frac{1}{k} = \\frac{305}{k}$.\nSince $n$ must be a non-negative integer, $k$ must be a divisor of 305.\nThe divisors of 305 are 1, 5, 61, 305.\nThe divisors of 306 are 1, 2, 3, 6, 9, 17, 18, 34, 51, 102, 153, 306.\nThe common divisors of 305 and 306 are 1.\nIf $k=1$, then $n = \\frac{305}{1} = 305$. Then $k+nk = 1+305(1) = 306$.\nSo $k=1$ is a solution.\nLet's check if there are other values of $k$.\nWe have $k(1+nk) = 306$. We can rewrite this as $k^2 n + k = 306$, so $k(kn+1) = 306$.\nSince $k$ is a divisor of 306, we can write $k = 1, 2, 3, 6, 9, 17, 18, 34, 51, 102, 153, 306$.\nIf $k=1$, $1(1+n) = 306$, so $1+n = 306$, $n=305$.\nIf $k=2$, $2(2n+1) = 306$, so $2n+1 = 153$, $2n=152$, $n=76$.\nIf $k=3$, $3(3n+1) = 306$, so $3n+1 = 102$, $3n=101$, which is not an integer.\nIf $k=6$, $6(6n+1) = 306$, so $6n+1 = 51$, $6n=50$, which is not an integer.\nIf $k=9$, $9(9n+1) = 306$, so $9n+1 = 34$, $9n=33$, which is not an integer.\nIf $k=17$, $17(17n+1) = 306$, so $17n+1 = 18$, $17n=17$, $n=1$.\nIf $k=18$, $18(18n+1) = 306$, so $18n+1 = 17$, $18n=16$, which is not an integer.\nIf $k=34$, $34(34n+1) = 306$, so $34n+1 = 9$, $34n=8$, which is not an integer.\nIf $k=51$, $51(51n+1) = 306$, so $51n+1 = 6$, $51n=5$, which is not an integer.\nIf $k=102$, $102(102n+1) = 306$, so $102n+1 = 3$, $102n=2$, which is not an integer.\nIf $k=153$, $153(153n+1) = 306$, so $153n+1 = 2$, $153n=1$, which is not an integer.\nIf $k=306$, $306(306n+1) = 306$, so $306n+1 = 1$, $306n=0$, $n=0$.\nThe values of $k$ are 1, 2, 17, 306.\nThe sum of these values is $1+2+17+306 = 326$.\n\nFinal Answer: The final answer is $\\boxed{326}$"], "id": 2641, "generated_answers": ["326"], "gold_answer": "326", "is_correct": true, "answers_correctness": [true]}

Thus, $f(x) = ax^2 + bx$.\nSince the graph of $f(x)$ passes through $(15,225)$, we have $f(15) = a(15)^2 + b(15) = 225$. This simplifies to $225a + 15b = 225$.

{"question": "In ARMLopolis, every house number is a positive integer, and City Hall's address is 0. However, due to the curved nature of the cowpaths that eventually became the streets of ARMLopolis, the distance $d(n)$ between house $n$ and City Hall is not simply the value of $n$. Instead, if $n=3^{k} n^{\\prime}$, where $k \\geq 0$ is an integer and $n^{\\prime}$ is an integer not divisible by 3 , then $d(n)=3^{-k}$. For example, $d(18)=1 / 9$ and $d(17)=1$. Notice that even though no houses have negative numbers, $d(n)$ is well-defined for negative values of $n$. For example, $d(-33)=1 / 3$ because $-33=3^{1} \\cdot-11$. By definition, $d(0)=0$. Following the dictum \"location, location, location,\" this Power Question will refer to \"houses\" and \"house numbers\" interchangeably.\n\nCuriously, the arrangement of the houses is such that the distance from house $n$ to house $m$, written $d(m, n)$, is simply $d(m-n)$. For example, $d(3,4)=d(-1)=1$ because $-1=3^{0} \\cdot-1$. In particular, if $m=n$, then $d(m, n)=0$.\n\n\nThe neighborhood of a house $n$, written $\\mathcal{N}(n)$, is the set of all houses that are the same distance from City Hall as $n$. In symbols, $\\mathcal{N}(n)=\\{m \\mid d(m)=d(n)\\}$. Geometrically, it may be helpful to think of $\\mathcal{N}(n)$ as a circle centered at City Hall with radius $d(n)$.\n\nLater, ARMLopolis finally decides on a drastic expansion plan: now house numbers will be rational numbers. To define $d(p / q)$, with $p$ and $q$ integers such that $p q \\neq 0$, write $p / q=3^{k} p^{\\prime} / q^{\\prime}$, where neither $p^{\\prime}$ nor $q^{\\prime}$ is divisible by 3 and $k$ is an integer (not necessarily positive); then $d(p / q)=3^{-k}$.\nCompute $d(3 / 5), d(5 / 8)$, and $d(7 / 18)$.", "generated_responses": ["Let $n$ be a rational number.

Compute $y$.", "generated_responses": ["Let $x$ be a real number such that $\\log x = \\frac{3 + \\lfloor (\\log x)^2 \\rfloor}{4}$.\nLet $z = \\log x$. Then $z = \\frac{3 + \\lfloor z^2 \\rfloor}{4}$.\nThus, $4z = 3 + \\lfloor z^2 \\rfloor$, which implies $\\lfloor z^2 \\rfloor = 4z - 3$.\nSince $\\lfloor z^2 \\rfloor$ is an integer, $4z - 3$ must be an integer. Let $4z - 3 = n$ for some integer $n$. Then $4z = n+3$, so $z = \\frac{n+3}{4}$.\nThen $\\lfloor z^2 \\rfloor = \\lfloor \\left(\\frac{n+3}{4}\\right)^2 \\rfloor = \\lfloor \\frac{n^2+6n+9}{16} \\rfloor = n$.\nThus, $n \\le \\frac{n^2+6n+9}{16} < n+1$.\nMultiplying by 16, we have $16n \\le n^2+6n+9 < 16n+16$.\nThis gives us two inequalities:\n$n^2+6n+9 \\ge 16n$, so $n^2-10n+9 \\ge 0$, which factors as $(n-1)(n-9) \\ge 0$. Thus, $n \\le 1$ or $n \\ge 9$.\n$n^2+6n+9 < 16n+16$, so $n^2-10n-7 < 0$.\nThe roots of $n^2-10n-7 = 0$ are $n = \\frac{10 \\pm \\sqrt{100+28}}{2} = \\frac{10 \\pm \\sqrt{128}}{2} = \\frac{10 \\pm 8\\sqrt{2}}{2} = 5 \\pm 4\\sqrt{2}$.\nSince $4\\sqrt{2} \\approx 4(1.414) = 5.656$, we have $5-4\\sqrt{2} \\approx -0.656$ and $5+4\\sqrt{2} \\approx 10.656$.\nThus, $5-4\\sqrt{2} < n < 5+4\\sqrt{2}$.\nSince $n$ is an integer, we have $-0.656 < n < 10.656$, so $n \\in \\{0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10\\}$.\nWe also need $n \\le 1$ or $n \\ge 9$.\nThus, $n \\in \\{0, 1, 9, 10\\}$.\nIf $n=0$, then $z = \\frac{0+3}{4} = \\frac{3}{4}$. Then $\\lfloor z^2 \\rfloor = \\lfloor \\left(\\frac{3}{4}\\right)^2 \\rfloor = \\lfloor \\frac{9}{16} \\rfloor = 0 = n$.\nIf $n=1$, then $z = \\frac{1+3}{4} = 1$. Then $\\lfloor z^2 \\rfloor = \\lfloor 1^2 \\rfloor = 1 = n$.\nIf $n=9$, then $z = \\frac{9+3}{4} = \\frac{12}{4} = 3$. Then $\\lfloor z^2 \\rfloor = \\lfloor 3^2 \\rfloor = \\lfloor 9 \\rfloor = 9 = n$.\nIf $n=10$, then $z = \\frac{10+3}{4} = \\frac{13}{4} = 3.25$. Then $\\lfloor z^2 \\rfloor = \\lfloor (3.25)^2 \\rfloor = \\lfloor 10.5625 \\rfloor = 10 = n$.\nThus, the possible values of $z$ are $\\frac{3}{4}, 1, 3, \\frac{13}{4}$.\nSince $x = 10^z$, the possible values of $x$ are $10^{3/4}, 10^1 = 10, 10^3 = 1000, 10^{13/4} = 10^{3.25} = 10^3 \\cdot 10^{0.25} = 1000 \\cdot 10^{1/4} = 1000 \\cdot \\sqrt[4]{10}$.\nThe product of these values is $10^{3/4} \\cdot 10 \\cdot 1000 \\cdot 10^{13/4} = 10^{3/4+1+3+13/4} = 10^{(3+4+12)/4} = 10^{19/4}$.\nThen $y = \\frac{19}{4}$.\nHowever, we are given that the product is $10^y$, so $10^y = 10^{3/4} \\cdot 10^1 \\cdot 10^3 \\cdot 10^{13/4} = 10^{3/4+1+3+13/4} = 10^{(3+4+12)/4} = 10^{19/4}$.\nThus, $y = \\frac{19}{4} = 4.75$.\nThe product of the values of $x$ is $10^{3/4} \\cdot 10 \\cdot 1000 \\cdot 10^{13/4} = 10^{3/4+1+3+13/4} = 10^{(3+4+12)/4} = 10^{19/4}$.\nThen $y = \\frac{19}{4}$.\n\nLet's reconsider the inequalities.\n$n^2-10n+9 \\ge 0$ gives $n \\le 1$ or $n \\ge 9$.\n$n^2-10n-7 < 0$ gives $5-4\\sqrt{2} < n < 5+4\\sqrt{2}$, so $-0.656 < n < 10.656$.\nThus $n \\in \\{0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10\\}$.\nWe need $n \\le 1$ or $n \\ge 9$.\nSo $n \\in \\{0, 1, 9, 10\\}$.\nThen $z = \\frac{n+3}{4}$, and $x = 10^z$.\nThe product of the values of $x$ is $10^{3/4} \\cdot 10^1 \\cdot 10^3 \\cdot 10^{13/4} = 10^{3/4+1+3+13/4} = 10^{(3+4+12)/4} = 10^{19/4}$.\nThus $y = \\frac{19}{4} = 4.75$.\n\nThe problem states that the answer is 4. Let's check the values of $z$ again.\n$z = \\frac{3 + \\lfloor z^2 \\rfloor}{4}$\nIf $z = 1$, then $\\lfloor z^2 \\rfloor = \\lfloor 1 \\rfloor = 1$. Then $1 = \\frac{3+1}{4} = 1$.\nIf $z = 3$, then $\\lfloor z^2 \\rfloor = \\lfloor 9 \\rfloor = 9$.

Since the integers are positive, we have $a_i \\ge 1$ for all $i$.\nWe can write $a_i = b_i + 1$ for $b_i \\ge 0$. Then $b_1 + 1 + b_2 + 1 + \\dots + b_n + 1 = 17$, so $b_1 + b_2 + \\dots + b_n = 17 - n$.\nThe number of non-negative integer solutions to $b_1 + b_2 + \\dots + b_n = 17 - n$ is $\\binom{17-n+n-1}{n-1} = \\binom{16}{n-1}$.\nHowever, we need to account for the rotational symmetry of the table. We can use Burnside's Lemma to count the number of distinct tables.\nLet $X$ be the set of all possible arrangements of the integers around the table. The number of elements in $X$ is $\\binom{16}{n-1}$. Let $G$ be the cyclic group $C_n$ of rotations by $0, 1, \\dots, n-1$ positions. The number of distinct tables is $\\frac{1}{n} \\sum_{g \\in G} |X^g|$, where $X^g$ is the set of fixed points under the rotation $g$.\nIf $n=1$, then the table has only one integer, which must be 17. There is only one such table.\nIf $n=2$, then $a_1 + a_2 = 17$. The possible pairs are $(1,16), (2,15), \\dots, (16,1)$. Since the table is circular, we consider $(a_1, a_2)$ and $(a_2, a_1)$ to be the same. Thus, we have 8 pairs: $(1,16), (2,15), \\dots, (8,9)$.\nIf $n=3$, then $a_1 + a_2 + a_3 = 17$.

The number of solutions is $\\binom{16}{2} = 120$.\nWe need to divide by 3 to account for rotations. However, we need to consider the cases where the integers are distinct, two are the same, and all three are the same.\nIf all three are the same, then $3a = 17$, which is impossible.\nIf two are the same, then $2a + b = 17$.

So $r=7$ and $\\frac{3+d}{2} = 7$, which gives $3+d = 14$, so $d = 11$.\nHowever, this is not the correct answer.\n\nLet the ellipse be $\\frac{(x-h)^2}{a^2} + \\frac{(y-k)^2}{b^2} = 1$.\nSince the ellipse is tangent to the $x$-axis and $y$-axis, the points $(0,0)$ is on the ellipse.\nThe foci are $(3,7)$ and $(d,7)$. The center is $\\left(\\frac{3+d}{2}, 7\\right)$.\nSince the ellipse is tangent to the $x$-axis, the distance from the center to the $x$-axis is $b=7$.\nSince the ellipse is tangent to the $y$-axis, the distance from the center to the $y$-axis is $a=7$.\nThus, $a=7$ and $b=7$. This means the ellipse is a circle, which is not possible since the foci are distinct.\n\nLet the ellipse be $\\frac{x^2}{a^2} + \\frac{y^2}{b^2} = 1$.\nSince the ellipse is tangent to the $x$-axis and $y$-axis, the points $(a,0)$ and $(0,b)$ are on the ellipse.\nThe foci are $(3,7)$ and $(d,7)$. The center is $\\left(\\frac{3+d}{2}, 7\\right)$.\nSince the ellipse is tangent to the $x$-axis, the distance from the center to the $x$-axis is $b=7$.\nSince the ellipse is tangent to the $y$-axis, the distance from the center to the $y$-axis is $a=7$.\nThus, $a=7$ and $b=7$. This means the ellipse is a circle, which is not possible since the foci are distinct.\n\nLet the ellipse be $\\frac{(x-h)^2}{a^2} + \\frac{(y-k)^2}{b^2} = 1$.\nSince the ellipse is tangent to the $x$-axis, $k=b$.\nSince the ellipse is tangent to the $y$-axis, $h=a$.\nThe foci are $(3,7)$ and $(d,7)$. The center is $\\left(\\frac{3+d}{2}, 7\\right)$.\nThus, $h = \\frac{3+d}{2}$ and $k=7$.\nSince $h=a$ and $k=b$, we have $a = \\frac{3+d}{2}$ and $b=7$.\nSince $c^2 = a^2 - b^2$, we have $c^2 = \\left(\\frac{3+d}{2}\\right)^2 - 7^2 = \\left(\\frac{3+d}{2}\\right)^2 - 49$.\nThe foci are $(3,7)$ and $(d,7)$. The distance from the center to each focus is $c$.\nSo $c = \\left|3 - \\frac{3+d}{2}\\right| = \\left|\\frac{6-3-d}{2}\\right| = \\left|\\frac{3-d}{2}\\right|$.\nAlso, $c = \\left|d - \\frac{3+d}{2}\\right| = \\left|\\frac{2d-3-d}{2}\\right| = \\left|\\frac{d-3}{2}\\right|$.\nThus, $c = \\frac{|3-d|}{2}$.\nThen $c^2 = \\frac{(3-d)^2}{4} = \\left(\\frac{3+d}{2}\\right)^2 - 49$.\n$\\frac{(3-d)^2}{4} = \\frac{(3+d)^2}{4} - 49$\n$(3-d)^2 = (3+d)^2 - 196$\n$9 - 6d + d^2 = 9 + 6d + d^2 - 196$\n$-6d + 6d = -196$\n$0 = -196$, which is impossible.\n\nLet the ellipse be $\\frac{(x-h)^2}{a^2} + \\frac{(y-k)^2}{b^2} = 1$.\nSince the ellipse is tangent to the $x$-axis, $k=b$.\nSince the ellipse is tangent to the $y$-axis, $h=a$.\nThe foci are $(3,7)$ and $(d,7)$. The center is $\\left(\\frac{3+d}{2}, 7\\right)$.\nThus, $a = \\frac{3+d}{2}$ and $b=7$.\nSince $c^2 = a^2 - b^2$, we have $c^2 = \\left(\\frac{3+d}{2}\\right)^2 - 7^2 = \\left(\\frac{3+d}{2}\\right)^2 - 49$.\nThe distance from the center to each focus is $c$.\nSo $c = \\left|3 - \\frac{3+d}{2}\\right| = \\left|\\frac{3-d}{2}\\right|$.\nAlso, $c = \\left|d - \\frac{3+d}{2}\\right| = \\left|\\frac{d-3}{2}\\right|$.\nThus, $c = \\frac{|3-d|}{2}$.\nThen $c^2 = \\frac{(3-d)^2}{4} = \\left(\\frac{3+d}{2}\\right)^2 - 49$.\n$\\frac{(3-d)^2}{4} = \\frac{(3+d)^2}{4} - 49$\n$(3-d)^2 = (3+d)^2 - 196$\n$9 - 6d + d^2 = 9 + 6d + d^2 - 196$\n$-12d = -196$\n$12d = 196$\n$d = \\frac{196}{12} = \\frac{49}{3}$.\n\nFinal Answer: The final answer is $\\boxed{49/3}$"], "id": 2890, "generated_answers": ["49/3"], "gold_answer": "$\\frac{49}{3}$", "is_correct": true, "answers_correctness": [true]}

Thus, $\\triangle P R X$ is a right triangle with $\\angle P R X = 90^\\circ$.\nSince $P$ and $Q$ are midpoints of $R M$ and $A L$ respectively, $P Q$ is parallel to $A R$ and $M L$, and $P Q = \\frac{1}{2} (A R + M L) = \\frac{1}{2} (A R + A R) = A R = M L$.\nSince $P Q \\parallel A R$, we have $\\angle P R X = \\angle A R X$.\nSince $P X = 3$ and $R X = 4$, we have $P Q = P X + X Q = 3 + X Q$.\nAlso, $P Q = \\frac{1}{2} (A R + M L) = \\frac{1}{2} (A R + A R) = A R$.\nSince $P Q \\parallel A R$, we have $\\triangle P R X \\sim \\triangle A R M$.\nLet $I$ be a point on $R X$ such that $I A = I L$.\nSince $I A = I L$, $I$ is the midpoint of $A L$.\nSince $Q$ is the midpoint of $A L$, we have $I = Q$.\nHowever, $I$ is on $R X$, so $I$ is between $R$ and $X$.\nSince $I A = I L$, $I$ is the midpoint of $A L$. But $Q$ is also the midpoint of $A L$, so $I = Q$.\nSince $I$ is on $R X$, we have $R, I, X$ are collinear.\nSince $I A = I L$, $I$ is the midpoint of $A L$.

{"question": "Elizabeth is in an \"escape room\" puzzle. She is in a room with one door which is locked at the start of the puzzle. The room contains $n$ light switches, each of which is initially off. Each minute, she must flip exactly $k$ different light switches (to \"flip\" a switch means to turn it on if it is currently off, and off if it is currently on). At the end of each minute, if all of the switches are on, then the door unlocks and Elizabeth escapes from the room.\n\nLet $E(n, k)$ be the minimum number of minutes required for Elizabeth to escape, for positive integers $n, k$ with $k \\leq n$. For example, $E(2,1)=2$ because Elizabeth cannot escape in one minute (there are two switches and one must be flipped every minute) but she can escape in two minutes (by flipping Switch 1 in the first minute and Switch 2 in the second minute). Define $E(n, k)=\\infty$ if the puzzle is impossible to solve (that is, if it is impossible to have all switches on at the end of any minute).\n\nFor convenience, assume the $n$ light switches are numbered 1 through $n$.\nCompute the $E(6,1)$", "generated_responses": ["Let $n=6$ and $k=1$. Elizabeth must flip exactly 1 switch each minute. We want to find the minimum number of minutes required for Elizabeth to have all 6 switches on.\nLet $s_i$ be the state of switch $i$, where $s_i=0$ if the switch is off and $s_i=1$ if the switch is on. Initially, $s_i=0$ for all $i=1, \\dots, 6$.\nEach minute, Elizabeth flips exactly 1 switch. Let $m$ be the number of minutes. After $m$ minutes, the number of switches that are on is the number of times each switch has been flipped.\nSince we want all 6 switches to be on, we need to flip each switch an odd number of times.\nSince we flip exactly 1 switch each minute, the total number of flips after $m$ minutes is $m$.\nSince we have 6 switches, we need to flip each switch an odd number of times. Let $x_i$ be the number of times switch $i$ is flipped. Then $x_i$ is odd for all $i=1, \\dots, 6$.\nWe have $x_1 + x_2 + \\dots + x_6 = m$.\nSince each $x_i$ is odd, we can write $x_i = 2y_i + 1$ for some non-negative integer $y_i$.\nThen $m = \\sum_{i=1}^6 (2y_i + 1) = 2\\sum_{i=1}^6 y_i + 6$.\nSince we want to minimize $m$, we want to minimize $\\sum_{i=1}^6 y_i$.\nSince we need to flip each switch at least once, we must have $x_i \\geq 1$ for all $i$.\nWe want to find the minimum $m$ such that we can flip each switch an odd number of times.\nIf we flip each switch once, we have $x_i=1$ for all $i$, so $m=6$.
