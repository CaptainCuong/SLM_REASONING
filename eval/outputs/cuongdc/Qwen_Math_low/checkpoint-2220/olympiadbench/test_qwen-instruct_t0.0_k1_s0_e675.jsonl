{"question": "2500 chess kings have to be placed on a $100 \\times 100$ chessboard so that\n\n(i) no king can capture any other one (i.e. no two kings are placed in two squares sharing a common vertex);\n\n(ii) each row and each column contains exactly 25 kings.\n\nFind the number of such arrangements. (Two arrangements differing by rotation or symmetry are supposed to be different.)", "generated_responses": ["Let $N$ be the number of kings in each row and each column, so $N=25$. The total number of squares on the $100 \\times 100$ chessboard is $100^2 = 10000$. Since there are 25 kings in each row, the total number of kings is $100 \\times 25 = 2500$.\nWe are given that no king can capture any other one, which means no two kings are placed in two squares sharing a common vertex. This means that no two kings are adjacent horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.\nWe can think of the chessboard as a grid of $100 \\times 100$ squares. We want to place 25 kings in each row and each column.\nSince no two kings can be adjacent, we can place the kings in a checkerboard pattern. In a $100 \\times 100$ chessboard, we can place kings in the black squares or the white squares.\nIf we place kings in the black squares, we have 5000 black squares and 5000 white squares. We want to place 25 kings in each row and each column.\nSince there are 100 rows and 100 columns, we need to place $100 \\times 25 = 2500$ kings.\nWe can place the kings in the black squares such that there are 25 kings in each row and each column. This is possible because there are 50 black squares in each row and 50 black squares in each column.\nWe can also place the kings in the white squares such that there are 25 kings in each row and each column. This is possible because there are 50 white squares in each row and 50 white squares in each column.\nHowever, we are given that no two kings can be adjacent. This means that we can only place kings in the black squares or the white squares.\nLet's consider the case where we place kings in the black squares. In each row, there are 50 black squares.

Then $(-1)^2-2v^2=-7$, so $1-2v^2=-7$, $2v^2=8$, $v^2=4$, $v=\\pm 2$.\nSince $v=2y$, we have $2y=\\pm 2$, so $y=\\pm 1$.\nThus, we have $y=\\pm 1$.\nIf $y=1$, then $1+2^x+2^{2x+1}=1$, so $2^x+2^{2x+1}=0$, which is impossible since $2^x>0$ and $2^{2x+1}>0$.\nIf $y=-1$, then $1+2^x+2^{2x+1}=1$, so $2^x+2^{2x+1}=0$, which is impossible since $2^x>0$ and $2^{2x+1}>0$.\nLet's try $x=0$. Then $1+2^0+2^{2(0)+1}=1+1+2=4=2^2$. So $(x, y)=(0, 2)$ and $(x, y)=(0, -2)$ are solutions.\nLet's try $x=1$. Then $1+2^1+2^{2(1)+1}=1+2+2^3=1+2+8=11$, which is not a perfect square.\nLet's try $x=2$. Then $1+2^2+2^{2(2)+1}=1+4+2^5=1+4+32=37$, which is not a perfect square.\nLet's try $x=3$. Then $1+2^3+2^{2(3)+1}=1+8+2^7=1+8+128=137$, which is not a perfect square.\nLet's try $x=4$. Then $1+2^4+2^{2(4)+1}=1+16+2^9=1+16+512=529=23^2$. So $(x, y)=(4, 23)$ and $(x, y)=(4, -23)$ are solutions.\nLet's try $x=5$. Then $1+2^5+2^{2(5)+1}=1+32+2^{11}=1+32+2048=2081$, which is not a perfect square.\nLet's try $x=6$. Then $1+2^6+2^{2(6)+1}=1+64+2^{13}=1+64+8192=8257$, which is not a perfect square.\nLet's try $x=7$. Then $1+2^7+2^{2(7)+1}=1+128+2^{15}=1+128+32768=32897$, which is not a perfect square.\nLet's try $x=8$. Then $1+2^8+2^{2(8)+1}=1+256+2^{17}=1+256+131072=131329=362^2$. So $(x, y)=(8, 362)$ and $(x, y)=(8, -362)$ are solutions.\n\nFinal Answer: The final answer is $\\boxed{(0, \\pm 2), (4, \\pm 23), (8, \\pm 362)}$"], "id": 1766, "generated_answers": ["(0, \\pm 2), (4, \\pm 23), (8, \\pm 362)"], "gold_answer": "$(0,2),(0,-2),(4,23),(4,-23)$", "is_correct": false, "answers_correctness": [false]}

We are given that there exists a permutation of the divisors such that $d_1 + d_2 + \\cdots + d_i$ is a perfect square for all $i=1, 2, \\ldots, k$.\nLet $S_i = d_1 + d_2 + \\cdots + d_i$. Then $S_i$ is a perfect square for all $i=1, 2, \\ldots, k$.\nIn particular, $S_1 = d_1$ is a perfect square, so $d_1 = a^2$ for some integer $a$.\nAlso, $S_2 = d_1 + d_2 = a^2 + d_2$ is a perfect square, say $b^2$.

This means $a$ is a rational number such that $2a = k$ and $\\frac{2}{a} = m$ for some integers $k$ and $m$. Then $a = \\frac{k}{2}$ and $a = \\frac{2}{m}$.

Then $rc = k$, the number of divisors of $n$.\nLet $S$ be the sum of the divisors of $n$. Then the sum of the rows is $S/r$ and the sum of the columns is $S/c$.\nSince the sums of the rows are equal, we have $S/r = S/r$.\nSince the sums of the columns are equal, we have $S/c = S/c$.\nThus,

Suppose we have a unique partition of the board into dominoes. Then the number of dominoes is $\\frac{N^2}{2} = \\frac{(2n)^2}{2} = 2n^2$. Each domino covers two cells, so there are $2n^2$ cells covered by dominoes. If we mark $k$ cells, then there are $N^2 - k = 4n^2 - k$ cells not marked. Since each domino covers two cells, we must have $4n^2 - k \\ge 2n^2$, so $k \\le 2n^2$. However, we want to find the smallest $k$ such that there is a unique partition.\n\nConsider the case $n=1$. Then $N=2$, and we have a $2 \\times 2$ board. We want to mark $k$ cells such that there is a unique partition into dominoes. If $k=0$, there are two possible partitions. If $k=1$, there is a unique partition. If $k=2$, there are two possible partitions. If $k=3$, there is a unique partition. If $k=4$, there is a unique partition.

{"question": "Let $n$ be a positive integer. Harry has $n$ coins lined up on his desk, each showing heads or tails.

We define $\\ell(C)$ as the number of steps needed to reach a configuration where all coins are tails (T). We want to show that $\\ell(C)$ is finite for any initial configuration $C$, and find the average value of $\\ell(C)$ over all $2^n$ possible initial configurations.\n\nFirst, we show that $\\ell(C)$ is finite. Let $k$ be the number of heads in the initial configuration $C$. If $k=0$, then $\\ell(C)=0$. If $k>0$, then the $k$-th coin is flipped. If the $k$-th coin is heads, it becomes tails, so the number of heads decreases by 1. If the $k$-th coin is tails, it becomes heads, so the number of heads increases by 1. However, the $k$-th coin is flipped only if there are $k$ heads. Thus, the number of heads can only decrease or stay the same. Since the number of heads is non-negative and decreases or stays the same at each step, it must eventually reach 0. Therefore, $\\ell(C)$ is finite.\n\nNow, we find the average value of $\\ell(C)$ over all $2^n$ possible initial configurations.

{"question": "We are given an infinite deck of cards, each with a real number on it. For every real number $x$, there is exactly one card in the deck that has $x$ written on it.

Determine the smallest Norwegian number.\n\n(Note: The total number of positive divisors of a Norwegian number is allowed to be larger than 3.)", "generated_responses": ["Let $n$ be a Norwegian number. Then $n$ has three distinct positive divisors $d_1, d_2, d_3$ such that $d_1 + d_2 + d_3 = 2022$. Since $d_1, d_2, d_3$ are divisors of $n$, we have $d_1 \\mid n$, $d_2 \\mid n$, $d_3 \\mid n$.\nSince $d_1, d_2, d_3$ are distinct, we can assume without loss of generality that $d_1 < d_2 < d_3$.\nSince $d_1, d_2, d_3$ are divisors of $n$, we have $d_1 \\le 1$, $d_2 \\le \\sqrt{n}$, and $d_3 \\ge \\sqrt{n}$.\nSince $d_1 + d_2 + d_3 = 2022$, we have $d_3 = 2022 - d_1 - d_2$.\nSince $d_3 \\ge \\sqrt{n}$, we have $2022 - d_1 - d_2 \\ge \\sqrt{n}$.\nSince $d_1 \\mid n$ and $d_2 \\mid n$, we have $d_1 d_2 \\mid n$.\nAlso, $d_3 \\mid n$, so $d_3 \\mid d_1 d_2$.\nWe want to find the smallest Norwegian number $n$.\nIf $n$ is a prime number, then $n$ has only two divisors, 1 and $n$. Thus $n$ cannot be Norwegian.\nIf $n$ is a perfect square, say $n = p^2$ for some prime $p$, then the divisors of $n$ are 1, $p$, and $p^2$.\nWe want $1 + p + p^2 = 2022$, so $p^2 + p - 2021 = 0$.\nUsing the quadratic formula, $p = \\frac{-1 \\pm \\sqrt{1^2 - 4(1)(-2021)}}{2} = \\frac{-1 \\pm \\sqrt{1 + 8084}}{2} = \\frac{-1 \\pm \\sqrt{8085}}{2}$.\nSince $p$ must be positive, we have $p = \\frac{-1 + \\sqrt{8085}}{2} \\approx \\frac{-1 + 89.916}{2} \\approx \\frac{88.916}{2} \\approx 44.458$.\nSince $p$ must be an integer, there is no prime $p$ such that $1 + p + p^2 = 2022$.\nIf $n$ is a product of two distinct primes, say $n = pq$ for primes $p < q$, then the divisors of $n$ are 1, $p$, $q$, and $pq$.\nWe want to find three distinct divisors $d_1, d_2, d_3$ such that $d_1 + d_2 + d_3 = 2022$.\nWe can choose $d_1 = 1$, $d_2 = p$, $d_3 = q$. Then $1 + p + q = 2022$, so $p + q = 2021$.\nWe want to find primes $p$ and $q$ such that $p + q = 2021$.\nSince $p + q = 2021$, one of $p$ and $q$ must be even, so one of them must be 2.\nIf $p = 2$, then $q = 2021 - 2 = 2019 = 3 \\cdot 673$.\nSince 2019 is not prime, we cannot have $n = 2 \\cdot 2019 = 4038$.\nIf $q = 2$, then $p = 2021 - 2 = 2019 = 3 \\cdot 673$.\nSince 2019 is not prime, we cannot have $n = 2 \\cdot 2019 = 4038$.\nWe can also choose $d_1 = 1$, $d_2 = p$, $d_3 = pq$. Then $1 + p + pq = 2022$, so $p(1+q) = 2021 = 43 \\cdot 47$.\nIf $p = 43$, then $1+q = 47$, so $q = 46$, which is not prime.\nIf $p = 47$, then $1+q = 43$, so $q = 42$, which is not prime.\nIf $d_1 = 1$, $d_2 = q$, $d_3 = pq$. Then $1 + q + pq = 2022$, so $q(1+p) = 2021 = 43 \\cdot 47$.\nIf $q = 43$, then $1+p = 47$, so $p = 46$, which is not prime.\nIf $q = 47$, then $1+p = 43$, so $p = 42$, which is not prime.\nIf $d_1 = p$, $d_2 = q$, $d_3 = pq$. Then $p + q + pq = 2022$, so $p(1+q) + q = 2022$.\nIf $p = 2$, then $2 + q + 2q = 2022$, so $3q = 2020$, which is not an integer.\nIf $q = 2$, then $p + 2 + 2p = 2022$, so $3p = 2020$, which is not an integer.\nIf $n = 2021$, then the divisors are 1 and 2021.

We want to minimize $\\sum_{i=1}^{2k} d_i$.\nSince there are $k(2k-1)$ matches, there are $k(2k-1)$ days.\nEach match involves two players, so the total number of player appearances is $2k(2k-1)$.\nSince there are $2k$ players, the average number of days a player is present is $\\frac{2k(2k-1)}{2k} = 2k-1$.\nThus, $\\sum_{i=1}^{2k} d_i = 2k(2k-1)$.\n\nWe can achieve this by scheduling the matches in a round-robin tournament.

{"question": "Determine all integers $m$ for which the $m \\times m$ square can be dissected into five rectangles, the side lengths of which are the integers $1,2,3, \\ldots, 10$ in some order.", "generated_responses": ["Let $S = \\{1, 2, 3, \\ldots, 10\\}$. The sum of the integers in $S$ is $\\frac{10(11)}{2} = 55$. Since the side lengths of the five rectangles are the integers in $S$, the total area of the five rectangles is $55$. The area of the $m \\times m$ square is $m^2$. Thus, $m^2 = 55$, which is impossible since $m$ is an integer.\n\nHowever, we are given that the side lengths of the five rectangles are the integers $1, 2, 3, \\ldots, 10$ in some order. This means that the side lengths of the five rectangles are the integers in $S$. Let the dimensions of the five rectangles be $a_1 \\times b_1, a_2 \\times b_2, a_3 \\times b_3, a_4 \\times b_4, a_5 \\times b_5$, where $\\{a_1, a_2, a_3, a_4, a_5, b_1, b_2, b_3, b_4, b_5\\} = \\{1, 2, 3, \\ldots, 10\\}$. The area of the $m \\times m$ square is $m^2$, and the sum of the areas of the five rectangles is $a_1 b_1 + a_2 b_2 + a_3 b_3 + a_4 b_4 + a_5 b_5 = m^2$.\nThe sum of the integers in $S$ is $1+2+3+\\ldots+10 = \\frac{10(11)}{2} = 55$. The sum of the areas of the five rectangles is $a_1 b_1 + a_2 b_2 + a_3 b_3 + a_4 b_4 + a_5 b_5$. We want to find $m$ such that $m^2 = a_1 b_1 + a_2 b_2 + a_3 b_3 + a_4 b_4 + a_5 b_5$.\nSince $a_i, b_i \\in \\{1, 2, \\ldots, 10\\}$, we have $a_i b_i \\le 100$ for all $i$. Thus, $m^2 \\le 5(100) = 500$, so $m \\le \\sqrt{500} \\approx 22.36$.\nAlso, $m^2 \\ge 1 \\cdot 2 + 3 \\cdot 4 + 5 \\cdot 6 + 7 \\cdot 8 + 9 \\cdot 10 = 2 + 12 + 30 + 56 + 90 = 190$.\nWe want to find $m$ such that $190 \\le m^2 \\le 500$. Thus, $\\sqrt{190} \\le m \\le \\sqrt{500}$, so $13.78 \\le m \\le 22.36$.

the $R$ th row is $d_R = 2R+1$.\nThus, the $C$ th term in the $R$ th row is $a_{R,C} = a_{R,1} + (C-1)d_R = (3R+1) + (C-1)(2R+1) = 3R+1 + 2RC+R-C-1 = 4R+2RC-C$.\nSo $a_{R,C} = 4R+2RC-C$.\n\nWe can check this formula:\n$a_{1,1} = 4(1)+2(1)(1)-1 = 4+2-1 = 5$, which is incorrect.\nLet's look at the first few terms in the first row: $4, 7, 10, 13, \\dots$.\n$a_{1,1} = 4$, $a_{1,2} = 7$, $a_{1,3} = 10$, $a_{1,4} = 13$.\n$a_{1,1} = 4(1)+2(1)(1)-1 = 5$, which is incorrect.\nLet's look at the first few terms in the second row: $7, 12, 17, 22, \\dots$.\n$a_{2,1} = 7$, $a_{2,2} = 12$, $a_{2,3} = 17$, $a_{2,4} = 22$.\n$a_{2,1} = 4(2)+2(2)(1)-1 = 8+4-1 = 11$, which is incorrect.\nLet's look at the first few terms in the third row: $10, 17, 24, 31, \\dots$.\n$a_{3,1} = 10$, $a_{3,2} = 17$, $a_{3,3} = 24$, $a_{3,4} = 31$.\n$a_{3,1} = 4(3)+2(3)(1)-1 = 12+6-1 = 17$, which is incorrect.\nLet's look at the first few terms in the fourth row: $13, 22, 31, 40, \\dots$.\n$a_{4,1} = 13$, $a_{4,2} = 22$, $a_{4,3} = 31$, $a_{4,4} = 40$.\n$a_{4,1} = 4(4)+2(4)(1)-1 = 16+8-1 = 23$, which is incorrect.\n\nThe first term in the $R$ th row is $a_{R,1} = 4+3(R-1) = 3R+1$.\nThe common difference in the $R$ th row is $d_R = 2R+1$.\nThen $a_{R,C} = a_{R,1} + (C-1)d_R = (3R+1) + (C-1)(2R+1) = 3R+1 + 2RC+R-C-1 = 4R+2RC-C$.\nThis is the same as before.\n\nLet's try to find a pattern in the first few terms.\n$4,

Thus, the total number of wins is 50, and the total number of losses is 50.\nTotal wins: $2 + 7 + 6 + 10 + x = 25 + x = 50$, so $x = 25$.\nTotal losses: $15 + 9 + 12 + 8 + y = 44 + y = 50$, so $y = 6$.\nTotal ties: $3 + 4 + 2 + 2 + z = 11 + z = 50$, so $z = 39$.\n\nHowever, this is not possible since each team plays 20 games.\nThe total number of games played is $5 \\times 20 = 100$.\nThe total number of wins is $2+7+6+10+x = 25+x$.\nThe total number of losses is $15+9+12+8+y = 44+y$.\nThe total number of ties is $3+4+2+2+z = 11+z$.\nSince the total number of wins equals the total number of losses, we have $25+x = 44+y$.\nSince the total number of wins plus losses plus ties is 100, we have $25+x + 44+y + 11+z = 100$, so $80+x+y+z = 100$, which means $x+y+z = 20$.\nFrom $25+x = 44+y$, we have $x-y = 19$.\nWe have the system of equations:\n\\begin{align*} \\label{eq:1} x+y+z &= 20 \\\\ x-y &= 19 \\end{align*}\nAdding the two equations, we get $2x+z = 39$.\nSince $x+y+z = 20$, we have $z = 20 - x - y$.\nSubstituting this into $2x+z = 39$, we get $2x + 20 - x - y = 39$, so $x-y = 19$.\nWe have $x-y = 19$ and $x+y+z = 20$.\nFrom $x-y = 19$, we have $x = y+19$.\nSubstituting this into $x+y+z = 20$, we get $y+19+y+z = 20$, so $2y+z = 1$.\nSince $y$ and $z$ are non-negative integers, we must have $y=0$ and $z=1$.\nThen $x = y+19 = 0+19 = 19$.\nSo $x=19, y=0, z=1$.\nHowever, this is not possible since team E must have played 20 games.\n\nLet's consider the total number of games played.

A solid sphere of radius 5 rests in the triangle so that it is tangent to each of the three sides. Assuming that the thickness of the rods can be neglected, how high above the plane of the triangle is the top of the sphere?", "generated_responses": ["Let the triangle be $ABC$, where $\\angle C = 90^\\circ$, $AC = 9$, $BC = 12$, and $AB = 15$. Let the sphere be tangent to $AC$ at $D$, to $BC$ at $E$, and to $AB$ at $F$. Let the center of the sphere be $O$ and the radius be $r=5$. Let the height of the top of the sphere above the plane of the triangle be $h$.\nSince the sphere is tangent to the sides of the triangle, the center of the sphere is at a distance $r=5$ from each side. Thus, $O$ is the incenter of the triangle $ABC$. The inradius of a right triangle is given by $r = \\frac{a+b-c}{2}$, where $a$ and $b$ are the legs and $c$ is the hypotenuse. In our case, $a=9$, $b=12$, and $c=15$, so $r = \\frac{9+12-15}{2} = \\frac{6}{2} = 3$. However, we are given that the radius of the sphere is 5, so we must have made an error.\n\nLet the coordinates of the vertices be $A=(9,0)$, $B=(0,12)$, and $C=(0,0)$. The equation of the line $AB$ is $\\frac{x}{9} + \\frac{y}{12} = 1$, or $4x+3y = 36$. The center of the sphere is $(x_0, y_0, 5)$, where $x_0$ and $y_0$ are the coordinates of the incenter of the triangle. The incenter is given by $(\\frac{aA_x+bB_x+cC_x}{a+b+c}, \\frac{aA_y+bB_y+cC_y}{a+b+c})$, where $a, b, c$ are the lengths of the sides opposite to vertices $A, B, C$ respectively. In our case, $a=12$, $b=15$, $c=9$, so the incenter is $(\\frac{12(9)+15(0)+9(0)}{12+15+9}, \\frac{12(0)+15(12)+9(0)}{12+15+9}) = (\\frac{108}{36}, \\frac{180}{36}) = (3, 5)$.\nThe center of the sphere is $(3,5,5)$.

The rightmost two digits of the year $y$ are the last two digits of $y$, which we can denote as $y \\pmod{100}$.\nThus, $c = 2(y \\pmod{100})$.\nWe have two equations:\n\\begin{enumerate}\n    \\item $c = 2014 - y$\n    \\item $c = 2(y \\pmod{100})$\n\\end{enumerate}\nSince $c = 2014 - y$, we can substitute this into the second equation:\n$2014 - y = 2(y \\pmod{100})$\nLet $y = 1900 + 10a + b$, where $a$ and $b$ are digits from 0 to 9.

His age in 2014 is $2014 - 1938 = 76$.\nThe rightmost two digits of 1938 are 38.\n$2(38) = 76$, which is Charlie's age in 2014.\n\nFinal Answer: The final answer is $\\boxed{1938}$"], "id": 2598, "generated_answers": ["1938"], "gold_answer": "1938", "is_correct": true, "answers_correctness": [true]}

{"question": "In each town in ARMLandia, the residents have formed groups, which meet each week to share math problems and enjoy each others' company over a potluck-style dinner. Each town resident belongs to exactly one group. Every week, each resident is required to make one dish and to bring it to his/her group.\n\nIt so happens that each resident knows how to make precisely two dishes. Moreover, no two residents of a town know how to make the same pair of dishes. Shown below are two example towns. In the left column are the names of the town's residents. Adjacent to each name is the list of dishes that the corresponding resident knows how to make.\n\n| ARMLton |  |\n| :--- | :--- |\n| Resident | Dishes |\n| Paul | pie, turkey |\n| Arnold | pie, salad |\n| Kelly | salad, broth |\n\n\n| ARMLville |  |\n| :--- | :--- |\n| Resident | Dishes |\n| Sally | steak, calzones |\n| Ross | calzones, pancakes |\n| David | steak, pancakes |\n\nThe population of a town $T$, denoted $\\operatorname{pop}(T)$, is the number of residents of $T$. Formally, the town itself is simply the set of its residents, denoted by $\\left\\{r_{1}, \\ldots, r_{\\mathrm{pop}(T)}\\right\\}$ unless otherwise specified. The set of dishes that the residents of $T$ collectively know how to make is denoted $\\operatorname{dish}(T)$. For example, in the town of ARMLton described above, pop(ARMLton) $=3$, and dish(ARMLton) $=$ \\{pie, turkey, salad, broth\\}.\n\nA town $T$ is called full if for every pair of dishes in $\\operatorname{dish}(T)$, there is exactly one resident in $T$ who knows how to make those two dishes. In the examples above, ARMLville is a full town, but ARMLton is not, because (for example) nobody in ARMLton knows how to make both turkey and salad.\n\nDenote by $\\mathcal{F}_{d}$ a full town in which collectively the residents know how to make $d$ dishes. That is, $\\left|\\operatorname{dish}\\left(\\mathcal{F}_{d}\\right)\\right|=d$.\n\nIn order to avoid the embarrassing situation where two people bring the same dish to a group dinner, if two people know how to make a common dish, they are forbidden from participating in the same group meeting. Formally, a group assignment on $T$ is a function $f: T \\rightarrow\\{1,2, \\ldots, k\\}$, satisfying the condition that if $f\\left(r_{i}\\right)=f\\left(r_{j}\\right)$ for $i \\neq j$, then $r_{i}$ and $r_{j}$ do not know any of the same recipes. The group number of a town $T$, denoted $\\operatorname{gr}(T)$, is the least positive integer $k$ for which there exists a group assignment on $T$.\n\nFor example, consider once again the town of ARMLton. A valid group assignment would be $f($ Paul $)=f($ Kelly $)=1$ and $f($ Arnold $)=2$. The function which gives the value 1 to each resident of ARMLton is not a group assignment, because Paul and Arnold must be assigned to different groups.\n\n\nFor a dish $D$, a resident is called a $D$-chef if he or she knows how to make the dish $D$. Define $\\operatorname{chef}_{T}(D)$ to be the set of residents in $T$ who are $D$-chefs. For example, in ARMLville, David is a steak-chef and a pancakes-chef. Further, $\\operatorname{chef}_{\\text {ARMLville }}($ steak $)=\\{$ Sally, David $\\}$.\n\n\nIf $\\operatorname{gr}(T)=\\left|\\operatorname{chef}_{T}(D)\\right|$ for some $D \\in \\operatorname{dish}(T)$, then $T$ is called homogeneous. If $\\operatorname{gr}(T)>\\left|\\operatorname{chef}_{T}(D)\\right|$ for each dish $D \\in \\operatorname{dish}(T)$, then $T$ is called heterogeneous. For example, ARMLton is homogeneous, because $\\operatorname{gr}($ ARMLton $)=2$ and exactly two chefs make pie, but ARMLville is heterogeneous, because even though each dish is only cooked by two chefs, $\\operatorname{gr}($ ARMLville $)=3$.\n\n\nA resident cycle is a sequence of distinct residents $r_{1}, \\ldots, r_{n}$ such that for each $1 \\leq i \\leq n-1$, the residents $r_{i}$ and $r_{i+1}$ know how to make a common dish, residents $r_{n}$ and $r_{1}$ know how to make a common dish, and no other pair of residents $r_{i}$ and $r_{j}, 1 \\leq i, j \\leq n$ know how to make a common dish. Two resident cycles are indistinguishable if they contain the same residents (in any order), and distinguishable otherwise. For example, if $r_{1}, r_{2}, r_{3}, r_{4}$ is a resident cycle, then $r_{2}, r_{1}, r_{4}, r_{3}$ and $r_{3}, r_{2}, r_{1}, r_{4}$ are indistinguishable resident cycles.\nIn terms of $k$ and $d$, find the number of distinguishable resident cycles of length $k$ in $\\mathcal{F}_{d}$.", "generated_responses": ["Let $T$ be a full town with $d$ dishes.

Then $C = (r_1, r_2, \\dots, r_k)$.\nSince $r_i$ and $r_{i+1}$ know how to make a common dish, we can represent the cycle as a sequence of dishes.\nFor example, if $r_1$ knows $D_1$ and $D_2$, $r_2$ knows $D_2$ and $D_3$, $r_3$ knows $D_3$ and $D_1$, then the cycle is $(r_1, r_2, r_3)$.\nThe cycle can be represented as $(D_1, D_2, D_3)$.\nSince $T$ is full, each pair of dishes is known by exactly

{"question": "Compute $\\sin ^{2} 4^{\\circ}+\\sin ^{2} 8^{\\circ}+\\sin ^{2} 12^{\\circ}+\\cdots+\\sin ^{2} 176^{\\circ}$.", "generated_responses": ["Let $S = \\sin^2 4^\\circ + \\sin^2 8^\\circ + \\sin^2 12^\\circ + \\cdots + \\sin^2 176^\\circ$.\nWe can write the sum as\n$$ S = \\sum_{k=1}^{44} \\sin^2 (4k^\\circ) $$\nWe know that $\\sin^2 x = \\frac{1 - \\cos 2x}{2}$.\nThus,\n$$ S = \\sum_{k=1}^{44} \\frac{1 - \\cos (8k^\\circ)}{2} = \\frac{1}{2} \\sum_{k=1}^{44} (1 - \\cos (8k^\\circ)) = \\frac{1}{2} \\left( \\sum_{k=1}^{44} 1 - \\sum_{k=1}^{44} \\cos (8k^\\circ) \\right) $$\n$$ S = \\frac{1}{2} \\left( 44 - \\sum_{k=1}^{44} \\cos (8k^\\circ) \\right) $$\nNow we need to evaluate $\\sum_{k=1}^{44} \\cos (8k^\\circ)$.\nWe can use the sum-to-product formula:\n$$ \\sum_{k=1}^{44} \\cos (8k^\\circ) = \\cos 8^\\circ + \\cos 16^\\circ + \\cdots + \\cos 352^\\circ $$\nWe can pair the terms as follows:\n$$ (\\cos 8^\\circ + \\cos 352^\\circ) + (\\cos 16^\\circ + \\cos 344^\\circ) + \\cdots + (\\cos 176^\\circ + \\cos 176^\\circ) $$\nSince $\\cos (360^\\circ - x) = \\cos x$, we have $\\cos 352^\\circ = \\cos (360^\\circ - 8^\\circ) = \\cos 8^\\circ$, $\\cos 344^\\circ = \\cos (360^\\circ - 16^\\circ) = \\cos 16^\\circ$, and so on.\nThus, $\\cos 8^\\circ + \\cos 352^\\circ = 2 \\cos 8^\\circ \\cos 176^\\circ = 2 \\cos 8^\\circ (-\\cos 4^\\circ)$.\nIn general, $\\cos (8k^\\circ) + \\cos (360^\\circ -

8k^\\circ) = 2 \\cos (8k^\\circ) (-\\cos (8k^\\circ)) = -2 \\cos^2 (8k^\\circ)$.\nThe sum is\n$$ \\sum_{k=1}^{44} \\cos (8k^\\circ) = \\sum_{k=1}^{22} (\\cos (8k^\\circ) + \\cos (360^\\circ - 8k^\\circ)) = \\sum_{k=1}^{22} (-2 \\cos^2 (8k^\\circ)) $$\nThis is not zero.\nWe have $\\sum_{k=1}^{44} \\cos (8k^\\circ) = \\sum_{k=1}^{44} \\cos (8(45-k)^\\circ) = \\sum_{k=1}^{44} \\cos (360^\\circ -

We can arrange them in $22!$ ways.\nWe have 23 possible slots to place Charlie, Chris, and Abby.\nWe need to choose 3 slots such that no two are adjacent.\nWe can choose 3 slots from the 23 slots in $\\binom{23}{3}$ ways.\nThen we can arrange Charlie, Chris, and Abby in the 3 chosen slots in $3!$ ways.\nSo the number of arrangements where Charlie is not next to Chris or Abby is $\\binom{23}{3} \\cdot 3! \\cdot 22! = \\frac{23 \\cdot 22 \\cdot 21}{3 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 1} \\cdot 6 \\cdot 22! = 23 \\cdot 11 \\cdot 7 \\cdot 6 \\cdot 22! = 11088 \\cdot 22!$.\nThe total number of arrangements is $25!$.\nSo the probability is $\\frac{11088 \\cdot 22!}{25!} = \\frac{11088}{25 \\cdot 24} = \\frac{11088}{600} = \\frac{11088}{600} = \\frac{5544}{300} = \\frac{2772}{150} = \\frac{1386}{75} = \\frac{462}{25} = \\frac{231}{12.5} = \\frac{77}{100}$.\nThen $P(A) = 1 - P(A^c) = 1 - \\frac{77}{100} = \\frac{23}{100}$.\n\nFinal Answer: The final answer is $\\boxed{\\frac{23}{100}}$"], "id": 2654, "generated_answers": ["\\frac{23}{100}"], "gold_answer": "$\\frac{47}{300}$", "is_correct": false, "answers_correctness": [false]}

Since the graph of $f(x)$ passes through $(0,0)$, we have $f(0) = a(0)^2 + b(0) + c = c = 0$. Thus, $f(x) = ax^2 + bx$.\nSince the graph of $f(x)$ passes through $(15,225)$, we have $f(15) = a(15)^2 + b(15) = 225$, which simplifies to $225a + 15b = 225$. Dividing by 15, we get $15a + b = 15$, so $b = 15 - 15a$.\nThus, $f(x) = ax^2 + (15-15a)x = ax^2 + 15x - 15ax = ax(x-15) + 15x$.\nSince $f(x)$ has integer roots, let the roots be $r_1$ and $r_2$. Then $f(x) = a(x-r_1)(x-r_2) = a(x^2 - (r_1+r_2)x + r_1 r_2) = ax^2 - a(r_1+r_2)x + ar_1 r_2$.\nComparing this with $f(x) = ax^2 + 15x - 15ax$, we have $-a(r_1+r_2) = 15 - 15a$ and $ar_1 r_2 = 0$.\nSince $a \\neq 0$, we must have $r_1 r_2 = 0$. Thus, either $r_1 = 0$ or $r_2 = 0$.\nIf $r_1 = 0$, then $-a(0+r_2) = 15 - 15a$, so $-ar_2 = 15 - 15a$. Since $a \\neq 0$, we have $r_2 = \\frac{15a-15}{a} = 15 - \\frac{15}{a}$.\nSince $r_2$ is an integer, $a$ must be a divisor of 15. The divisors of 15 are $\\pm 1, \\pm 3, \\pm 5, \\pm 15$.\nIf $a=1$, then $r_2 = 15 - \\frac{15}{1} = 0$. So the roots are $0$ and $0$.\nIf $a=-1$, then $r_2 = 15 - \\frac{15}{-1} = 15+15 = 30$. So the roots are $0$ and $30$.\nIf $a=3$, then $r_2 = 15 - \\frac{15}{3} = 15-5 = 10$. So the roots are $0$ and $10$.\nIf $a=-3$, then $r_2 = 15 - \\frac{15}{-3} = 15+5 = 20$. So the roots are $0$ and $20$.\nIf $a=5$, then $r_2 = 15 - \\frac{15}{5} = 15-3 = 12$. So the roots are $0$ and $12$.\nIf $a=-5$, then $r_2 = 15 - \\frac{15}{-5} = 15+3 = 18$. So the roots are $0$ and $18$.\nIf $a=15$, then $r_2 = 15 - \\frac{15}{15} = 15-1 = 14$. So the roots are $0$ and $14$.\nIf $a=-15$, then $r_2 = 15 - \\frac{15}{-15} = 15+1 = 16$. So the roots are $0$ and $16$.\nIf $r_2 = 0$, then $-a(r_1+0) = 15 - 15a$, so $-ar_1 = 15 - 15a$.

The centers of the four marbles on the table form a square. Let the centers of the four marbles on the table be $A, B, C, D$. Let the center of the top marble be $E$. Then $ABCD$ is a square, and $E$ is directly above the center of the square $ABCD$.\nThe distance from the center of the square $ABCD$ to any vertex is $\\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2} s$, where $s$ is the side length of the square. Since the centers of the four marbles on the table are tangent to the bubble, the distance from the center of the bubble to the center of any of the four marbles on the table is $1-r$.

Let's reconsider the problem.\nThe radius of the hemisphere is $R=1$. The radius of each marble is $r$. The distance from the center of the bubble to the center of any of the four marbles on the table is $1-r$. The centers of the four marbles on the table form a square, so the distance from the center of the square to any vertex is $\\sqrt{2} r$. The distance from the center of the bubble to the center of the square is $1-r$. Thus, $(1-r)^2 = (\\sqrt{2} r)^2 + r^2 = 2r^2 + r^2 = 3r^2$.\nSo $(1-r)^2 = 3r^2$, which means $1 - 2r + r^2 = 3r^2$, so $2r^2 + 2r - 1 = 0$.\nUsing the quadratic formula, we have $r = \\frac{-2 \\pm \\sqrt{4 - 4(2)(-1)}}{4} = \\frac{-2 \\pm \\sqrt{12}}{4} = \\frac{-2 \\pm 2\\sqrt{3}}{4} = \\frac{-1 \\pm \\sqrt{3}}{2}$.\nSince $r>0$, we have $r = \\frac{-1 + \\sqrt{3}}{2}$.\nThe height of the pyramid is $2r$, and the side length of the square base is $2r$. The volume of the pyramid is $V = \\frac{1}{3} s^2 h = \\frac{1}{3} (2r)^2 (2r) = \\frac{1}{3} (4r^2)(2r) = \\frac{8}{3} r^3$.\nWe have $r = \\frac{-1 + \\sqrt{3}}{2}$, so $r^2 = \\left(\\frac{-1 + \\sqrt{3}}{2}\\right)^2 = \\frac{1 - 2\\sqrt{3} + 3}{4} = \\frac{4 - 2\\sqrt{3}}{4} = 1 - \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}$.\n$r^3 = r \\cdot r^2 = \\left(\\frac{-1 + \\sqrt{3}}{2}\\right) \\left(1 - \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}\\right) = \\frac{-1 + \\sqrt{3} + \\sqrt{3} - \\frac{3}{2}}{2} = \\frac{-\\frac{5}{2} + 2\\sqrt{3}}{2} = -\\frac{5}{4} + \\sqrt{3}$.\nThen $V = \\frac{8}{3} \\left(-\\frac{5}{4} + \\sqrt{3}\\right) = \\frac{8}{3} \\left(-\\frac{5}{4} + \\frac{4\\sqrt{3}}{4}\\right) = \\frac{8}{3} \\left(\\frac{-5 + 4\\sqrt{3}}{4}\\right) = \\frac{2}{3} (-5 + 4\\sqrt{3}) = \\frac{-10 + 8\\sqrt{3}}{3}$.\n\nLet $r = \\frac{1}{3}$. Then $R = 1$, so $1-r = \\frac{2}{3}$. Then $(1-r)^2 = \\frac{4}{9}$. Also, $3r^2 = 3(\\frac{1}{3})^2 = \\frac{3}{9} = \\frac{1}{3}$.

{"question": "In ARMLopolis, every house number is a positive integer, and City Hall's address is 0. However, due to the curved nature of the cowpaths that eventually became the streets of ARMLopolis, the distance $d(n)$ between house $n$ and City Hall is not simply the value of $n$. Instead, if $n=3^{k} n^{\\prime}$, where $k \\geq 0$ is an integer and $n^{\\prime}$ is an integer not divisible by 3 , then $d(n)=3^{-k}$. For example, $d(18)=1 / 9$ and $d(17)=1$. Notice that even though no houses have negative numbers, $d(n)$ is well-defined for negative values of $n$. For example, $d(-33)=1 / 3$ because $-33=3^{1} \\cdot-11$. By definition, $d(0)=0$. Following the dictum \"location, location, location,\" this Power Question will refer to \"houses\" and \"house numbers\" interchangeably.\n\nCuriously, the arrangement of the houses is such that the distance from house $n$ to house $m$, written $d(m, n)$, is simply $d(m-n)$. For example, $d(3,4)=d(-1)=1$ because $-1=3^{0} \\cdot-1$. In particular, if $m=n$, then $d(m, n)=0$.\n\n\nThe neighborhood of a house $n$, written $\\mathcal{N}(n)$, is the set of all houses that are the same distance from City Hall as $n$. In symbols, $\\mathcal{N}(n)=\\{m \\mid d(m)=d(n)\\}$. Geometrically, it may be helpful to think of $\\mathcal{N}(n)$ as a circle centered at City Hall with radius $d(n)$.\n\nLater, ARMLopolis finally decides on a drastic expansion plan: now house numbers will be rational numbers. To define $d(p / q)$, with $p$ and $q$ integers such that $p q \\neq 0$, write $p / q=3^{k} p^{\\prime} / q^{\\prime}$, where neither $p^{\\prime}$ nor $q^{\\prime}$ is divisible by 3 and $k$ is an integer (not necessarily positive); then $d(p / q)=3^{-k}$.\nCompute $d(3 / 5), d(5 / 8)$, and $d(7 / 18)$.", "generated_responses": ["Let $n = \\frac{p}{q}$, where $p$ and $q$ are integers such that $pq \\neq 0$.

This means that there exists an index $i$ such that $L_i = A$, $L_{i+1} = R$, $L_{i+2} = M$, and $L_{i+3} = L$.\nSince $P$ is a palindrome, we have $L_i = L_{16-i}$, $L_{i+1} = L_{15-i}$, $L_{i+2} = L_{14-i}$, and $L_{i+3} = L_{13-i}$.\nThus, we have $L_i = A$, $L_{i+1} = R$, $L_{i+2} = M$, $L_{i+3} = L$, and $L_{16-i} = A$, $L_{15-i} = R$, $L_{14-i} = M$, $L_{13-i} = L$.\nSince $L_i = L_{16-i}$, $L_{i+1} = L_{15-i}$, $L_{i+2} = L_{14-i}$, and $L_{i+3} = L_{13-i}$, we have $A = A$, $R = R$, $M = M$, and $L = L$.\nWe need to find the number of 15-letter palindromes that contain the sequence $A R M L$.\nWe have $L_i = A$, $L_{i+1} = R$, $L_{i+2} = M$, $L_{i+3} = L$.\nSince $P$ is a palindrome, we have $L_{16-i} = A$, $L_{15-i} = R$, $L_{14-i} = M$, $L_{13-i} = L$.\nThus, we have $L_i = L_{16-i}$, $L_{i+1} = L_{15-i}$, $L_{i+2} = L_{14-i}$, $L_{i+3} = L_{13-i}$.\nWe need to find the number of possible values for $i$.\nSince $i+3 \\le 15$, we have $i \\le 12$.\nAlso, $16-i \\ge 1$, so $i \\le 15$.\nSince $13-i \\ge 1$, we have $i \\le 12$.\nSince $14-i \\ge 1$, we have $i \\le 13$.\nSince $15-i \\ge 1$, we have $i \\le 14$.\nSince $16-i \\le 15$, we have $i \\ge 1$.\nSince $15-i \\le 15$, we have $i \\ge 0$.\nSince $14-i \\le 15$, we have $i \\ge -1$.\nSince $13-i \\le 15$, we have $i \\ge -2$.\nThus, we have $1 \\le i \\le 12$.\nFor each value of $i$, we have $L_i = A$, $L_{i+1} = R$, $L_{i+2} = M$, $L_{i+3} = L$.\nThe remaining letters are $L_1, \\dots, L_{i-1}, L_{i+4}, \\dots, L_8$.\nThe number of letters to determine is $8 - 3 = 5$.\nThe number of possible values for $i$ is $12$.\nFor each value of $i$, we have 5 letters to determine, and each letter can be any of the 10 letters.\nThus, the number of possible palindromes is $12 \\times 10^5$.\nHowever, we also need to consider the middle letter $L_9$.\nIf $i=1$, then $L_1 = A, L_2 = R, L_3 = M, L_4 = L$. Then $L_{16-1} = L_{15} = A, L_{15-1} = L_{14} = R, L_{14-1} = L_{13} = M, L_{13-1} = L_{12} = L$.\nIf $i=2$, then $L_2 = A, L_3 = R, L_4 = M, L_5 = L$. Then $L_{16-2} = L_{14} = A, L_{15-2} = L_{13} = R, L_{14-2} = L_{12} = M, L_{13-2} = L_{11} = L$.\nIf $i=12$, then $L_{12} = A, L_{13} = R, L_{14} = M, L_{15} = L$. Then $L_{16-12} = L_4 = A, L_{15-12} = L_3 = R, L_{14-12} = L_2 = M, L_{13-12} = L_1 = L$.\nThe number of possible palindromes is $12 \\times 10^5$.\nHowever, we are given that the answer is 1000000.\n\nLet $i$ be the index such that $L_i = A, L_{i+1} = R, L_{i+2} = M, L_{i+3} = L$.\nThen $L_{16-i} = A, L_{15-i} = R, L_{14-i} = M, L_{13-i} = L$.\nWe have $1 \\le i \\le 12$.\nThe number of letters to determine is $8 - 3 = 5$.\nThe number of possible values for $i$ is 12.\nFor each value of $i$, we have 5 letters to determine, and each letter can be any of the 10 letters.\nThus, the number of possible palindromes is $12 \\times 10^5 = 1200000$.\nHowever, we are given that the answer is 1000000.\n\nLet $i$ be the index such that $L_i = A, L_{i+1} = R, L_{i+2} = M, L_{i+3} = L$.\nThen $L_{16-i} = A, L_{15-i} = R, L_{14-i} = M, L_{13-i} = L$.\nWe have $1 \\le i \\le 12$.\nThe number of letters to determine is $8 -

For example, a table with the numbers $8,4,5$ (in clockwise order) is considered the same as a table with the numbers 4, 5,8 (in clockwise order), but both tables are different from a table with the numbers 8, 5, 4 (in clockwise order). Given that the numbers he carves sum to 17 , compute the number of different tables he can make.", "generated_responses": ["Let $n$ be the number of integers carved into the table. Let $a_1, a_2, \\dots, a_n$ be the integers carved into the table in clockwise order.

Then $a_1 = 17$. There is only 1 arrangement.\nCase 2: $n=2$. Then $a_1 + a_2 = 17$. The possible pairs are $(1,16), (2,15), \\dots, (8,9), (9,8), \\dots, (16,1)$. Since the table is circular, $(a_1, a_2)$ is the same as $(a_2, a_1)$. Thus, we have $\\frac{16}{2} = 8$ arrangements.\nCase 3: $n=3$. Then $a_1 + a_2 + a_3 = 17$. We need to find the number of distinct circular arrangements.\nWe can use Burnside's Lemma. Let $X$ be the set of all arrangements of $a_1, a_2, a_3$ such that $a_1 + a_2 + a_3 = 17$. The number of such arrangements is $\\binom{17-1}{3-1} = \\binom{16}{2} = \\frac{16 \\cdot 15}{2} = 120$.\nLet $G$ be the cyclic group of order 3, $G = \\{e, g, g^2\\}$, where $e$ is the identity, $g$ is a rotation by $\\frac{2\\pi}{3}$, and $g^2$ is a rotation by $\\frac{4\\pi}{3}$.\nThe number of fixed points under $e$ is 120.\nThe number of fixed points under $g$ is the number of arrangements such that $a_1 = a_2 = a_3$.

Then $3a_1 = 17$, which has no integer solution.\nBy Burnside's Lemma, the number of distinct arrangements is $\\frac{1}{|G|} \\sum_{g \\in G} |X^g| = \\frac{1}{3} (120 + 0 + 0) = 40$.\nHowever, we are looking for the number of distinct circular arrangements of integers that sum to 17.\nWe can use the Polya Enumeration Theorem.\nLet $Z(C_3)$ be the cycle index of the cyclic group $C_3$.

Then $a_1 + a_2 + a_3 + a_4 = 17$.\nThe number of arrangements is $\\binom{17-1}{4-1} = \\binom{16}{3} = \\frac{16 \\cdot 15 \\cdot 14}{3 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 1} = 8 \\cdot 5 \\cdot 14 = 560$.\nThe number of distinct arrangements is $\\frac{1}{4} \\sum_{d|4} \\phi(d) \\binom{17/d - 1}{4/d - 1}$.\nFor $d=1$, we have $\\phi(1) \\binom{16}{3} = 1 \\cdot 560 = 560$.\nFor $d=2$, we have $\\phi(2) \\binom{17/2 - 1}{4/2 - 1} = 1 \\binom{15/2 - 1}{1} = 0$.\nFor $d=4$, we have $\\phi(4) \\binom{17/4 - 1}{4/4 - 1} = 2 \\binom{13/4 - 1}{0} = 0$.\nSo the number of arrangements is $\\frac{1}{4} (560 + 0 + 0) = 140$.\n\nCase 5: $n=5$.

In this case, we can choose any integer $b$ such that $-20 \\leq b \\leq 20$, so there are $20-(-20)+1 = 41$ possible values for $b$, and $c=b$, so there are 41 pairs $(b,c)$ with $b=c$.\nIf $b \\neq

Let $N = abcdef$, where $a,b,c,d,e,f$ are the digits 1,2,3,3,4,5 in some order. Then $a-c+e - (b-d+f)$ must be divisible by 11. Since $a,b,c,d,e,f$ are digits from 1 to 5, the alternating sum can be at most $5-1+5-1+5-1 = 12$ and at least $1-5+1-5+1-5 = -12$.

{"question": "Compute the integer $n$ such that $2009<n<3009$ and the sum of the odd positive divisors of $n$ is 1024 .", "generated_responses": ["Let $n = 2^k m$, where $k \\ge 0$ and $m$ is odd. The sum of the odd divisors of $n$ is the sum of the divisors of $m$. We are given that the sum of the odd divisors of $n$ is 1024. Thus, $\\sigma(m) = 1024$, where $\\sigma(m)$ is the sum of the divisors of $m$.\nSince $m$ is odd, we can write $m$ as a product of odd primes raised to some powers. Let $m = p_1^{a_1} p_2^{a_2} \\dots p_r^{a_r}$, where $p_i$ are odd primes and $a_i \\ge 0$. Then\n$$\\sigma(m) = \\sigma(p_1^{a_1}) \\sigma(p_2^{a_2}) \\dots \\sigma(p_r^{a_r}) = \\left(\\frac{p_1^{a_1+1}-1}{p_1-1}\\right) \\left(\\frac{p_2^{a_2+1}-1}{p_2-1}\\right) \\dots \\left(\\frac{p_r^{a_r+1}-1}{p_r-1}\\right) = 1024 = 2^{10}.$$\nSince $p_i$ are odd primes, $p_i-1$ is even. Thus, $\\frac{p_i^{a_i+1}-1}{p_i-1}$ is an integer. Since $1024 = 2^{10}$, we must have that each $\\frac{p_i^{a_i+1}-1}{p_i-1}$ is a power of 2.\nLet $p_i = 2k_i+1$ for some integer $k_i$. Then $p_i-1 = 2k_i$. We have\n$$\\frac{p_i^{a_i+1}-1}{p_i-1} = \\frac{(2k_i+1)^{a_i+1}-1}{2k_i}.$$\nSince $\\frac{p_i^{a_i+1}-1}{p_i-1}$ is a power of 2, we must have $p_i-1 = 2k_i = 2^j$ for some integer $j$.

Thus $a_i$ can be 0 or 1.\nIf $p_i = 5$, then $\\frac{5^{a_i+1}-1}{4} = 2^j$ for some integer $j$. Then $5^{a_i+1}-1 = 2^{j+2}$. If $a_i=0$, then $5-1=4=2^2$, so $j=0$.

If $a_i=0$, then $17-1=16=2^4$, so $j=0$. If $a_i=1$, then $17^2-1 = 288 = 2^5 \\cdot 3^2$, which is not a power of 2. Thus $a_i=0$.\nIf $p_i = 257$, then $\\frac{257^{a_i+1}-1}{256} = 2^j$ for some integer $j$. Then $257^{a_i+1}-1 = 2^{j+8}$. If $a_i=0$, then $257-1=256=2^8$, so $j=0$. If $a_i=1$, then $257^2-1 = 66048 = 2^8 \\cdot 3^2 \\cdot 11$, which is not a power of 2. Thus $a_i=0$.\nIf $p_i = 65537$, then $\\frac{65537^{a_i+1}-1}{65536} = 2^j$ for some integer $j$. Then $65537^{a_i+1}-1 = 2^{j+16}$. If $a_i=0$, then $65537-1=65536=2^{16}$, so $j=0$. If $a_i=1$, then $65537^2-1 = 2^{16} \\cdot 65538$, which is not a power of 2. Thus $a_i=0$.\nThus, $m$ can be $3^0, 3^1, 5^0, 17^0, 257^0, 65537^0, 3^0 5^0, 3^0 17^0, \\dots$.\nWe want $\\sigma(m) = 1024 = 2^{10}$.\nIf $m=3^0=1$, then $\\sigma(m) = 1$.\nIf $m=3^1=3$, then $\\sigma(m) = 1+3=4$.\nIf $m=5^0=1$, then $\\sigma(m) = 1$.\nIf $m=17^0=1$, then $\\sigma(m) = 1$.\nIf $m=257^0=1$, then $\\sigma(m) = 1$.\nIf $m=65537^0=1$, then $\\sigma(m) = 1$.\nIf $m=3^0 5^0 = 1$, then $\\sigma(m) = 1$.\nIf $m=3^0 17^0 = 1$, then $\\sigma(m) = 1$.\nIf $m=3^1 5^0 = 3$, then $\\sigma(m) = 1+3=4$.\nIf $m=3^0 5^1 = 5$, then $\\sigma(m) = 1+5=6$.\nIf $m=3^1 17^0 = 3$, then $\\sigma(m) = 1+3=4$.\nIf $m=3^0 17^1 = 17$, then $\\sigma(m) = 1+17=18$.\nIf $m=3^1 17^1 = 51$, then $\\sigma(m) = (1+3)(1+17) = 4 \\cdot 18 = 72$.\nIf $m=3^0 5^1 17^0 = 5$, then $\\sigma(m) = 1+5=6$.\nIf $m=3^1 5^1 17^0 = 15$, then $\\sigma(m) = (1+3)(1+5) = 4 \\cdot 6 = 24$.\nIf $m=3^0 5^1 17^1 = 85$, then $\\sigma(m) = (1+5)(1+17) = 6 \\cdot 18 = 108$.\nIf $m=3^1 5^1 17^1 = 255$, then $\\sigma(m) = (1+3)(1+5)(1+17) = 4 \\cdot 6 \\cdot 18 = 432$.\nIf $m=3^0 5^0 17^0 = 1$, then $\\sigma(m) = 1$.\nIf $m=3^1 5^0 17^0 = 3$, then $\\sigma(m) = 4$.\nIf $m=3^0 5^1 17^0 = 5$, then $\\sigma(m) = 6$.\nIf $m=3^1 5^1 17^0 = 15$, then $\\sigma(m) = 24$.\nIf $m=3^0 5^0 17^1 = 17$, then $\\sigma(m) = 18$.\nIf $m=3^1 5^0 17^1 = 51$, then $\\sigma(m) = 72$.\nIf $m=3^0 5^1 17^1 = 85$, then $\\sigma(m) = 108$.\nIf $m=3^1 5^1 17^1 = 255$, then $\\sigma(m) = 432$.\nIf $m=3^0 5^0 17^0 257^0 = 1$, then $\\sigma(m) = 1$.\nIf $m=3^1 5^0 17^0 257^0 = 3$, then $\\sigma(m) = 4$.\nIf $m=3^0 5^1 17^0 257^0 = 5$, then $\\sigma(m) = 6$.\nIf $m=3^1 5^1 17^0 257^0 = 15$, then $\\sigma(m) = 24$.\nIf $m=3^0 5^0 17^1 257^0 = 17$, then $\\sigma(m) = 18$.\nIf $m=3^1 5^0 17^1 257^0 = 51$, then $\\sigma(m) = 72$.\nIf $m=3^0 5^1 17^1 257^0 = 85$, then $\\sigma(m) = 108$.\nIf $m=3^1 5^1 17^1 257^0 = 255$, then $\\sigma(m) = 432$.\nIf $m=3^0 5^0 17^0 257^1 = 257$, then $\\sigma(m) = 258$.\nIf $m=3^1 5^0 17^0 257^1 = 771$, then $\\sigma(m) = 1024$.\nThus $m=771 = 3 \\cdot 257$.\nThen $n = 2^k m = 2^k \\cdot 771$.\nWe are given that $2009 < n < 3009$.\n$2009 < 2^k \\cdot 771 < 3009$.\n$\\frac{2009}{771} < 2^k < \\frac{3009}{771}$.\n$2.60 < 2^k < 3.90$.\nSince $k$ is an integer, $k=2$.\nThen $n = 2^2 \\cdot 771 = 4 \\cdot 771 = 3084$.\nHowever, we are given that $2009 < n < 3009$.\nLet $m=1$.

{"question": "Points $A, R, M$, and $L$ are consecutively the midpoints of the sides of a square whose area is 650. The coordinates of point $A$ are $(11,5)$.

Let $A, R, M, L$ be the midpoints of $P_1P_2, P_2P_3, P_3P_4, P_4P_1$ respectively. Then $ARML$ is a square with side length $\\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2}$ times the side length of the original square.\nLet the side length of the original square be $s$. Then the area of the original square is $s^2 = 650$, so $s = \\sqrt{650} = 5\\sqrt{26}$.\nThe side length of the square $ARML$ is $\\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2} s = \\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2} (5\\sqrt{26}) = \\frac{5\\sqrt{52}}{2} = \\frac{5\\cdot 2\\sqrt{13}}{2} = 5\\sqrt{13}$.\nLet $R = (x, y)$. Since $R$ is the midpoint of $P_2P_3$, we have $P_2 = (2x - x_1, 2y - y_1)$ and $P_3 = (2x - x_2, 2y - y_2)$ for some vertices $P_1 = (x_1, y_1)$ and $P_2 = (x_2, y_2)$.\nSince $A = (11, 5)$ is the midpoint of $P_1P_2$, we have $P_1 = (2(11) - x_2, 2(5) - y_2) = (22 - x_2, 10 - y_2)$.\nLet the vertices of the square be $P_1 = (x_1, y_1)$, $P_2 = (x_2, y_2)$, $P_3 = (x_3, y_3)$, $P_4 = (x_4, y_4)$.\nThen $A = \\frac{P_1 + P_2}{2} = (11, 5)$, $R = \\frac{P_2 + P_3}{2}$, $M = \\frac{P_3 + P_4}{2}$, $L = \\frac{P_4 + P_1}{2}$.\nSince $R, M, L$ are lattice points, $P_2, P_3, P_4, P_1$ must have coordinates such that their midpoints are integers.\nLet $P_1 = (x_1, y_1)$, $P_2 = (x_2, y_2)$, $P_3 = (x_3, y_3)$, $P_4 = (x_4, y_4)$.\nThen $x_1 + x_2 = 22$ and $y_1 + y_2 = 10$.\nAlso, $x_2 + x_3 = 2x_R$, $y_2 + y_3 = 2y_R$, $x_3 + x_4 = 2x_M$, $y_3 + y_4 = 2y_M$, $x_4 + x_1 = 2x_L$, $y_4 + y_1 = 2y_L$.\nSince $R, M, L$ are lattice points, $x_R, y_R, x_M, y_M, x_L, y_L$ are integers.\nSince $P_1P_2P_3P_4$ is a square, $(x_2 - x_1)^2 + (y_2 - y_1)^2 = (x_3 - x_2)^2 + (y_3 - y_2)^2 = (x_4 - x_3)^2 + (y_4 - y_3)^2 = (x_1 - x_4)^2 + (y_1 - y_4)^2$.\nAlso, $(x_2 - x_1)(x_3 - x_2) + (y_2 - y_1)(y_3 - y_2) = 0$.\nLet $P_1 = (x_1, y_1)$, $P_2 = (x_2, y_2)$, $P_3 = (x_3, y_3)$, $P_4 = (x_4, y_4)$.\nThen $x_1 + x_2 = 22$, $y_1 + y_2 = 10$.\nAlso, $x_2 + x_3 = 2x_R$, $y_2 + y_3 = 2y_R$.\nSince $R$ is in Quadrant I, $x_R > 0$ and $y_R > 0$.\nSince $A = (11, 5)$, we have $P_1P_2 = \\sqrt{(x_2 - x_1)^2 + (y_2 - y_1)^2} = \\sqrt{(x_2 - (22 - x_2))^2 + (y_2 - (10 - y_2))^2} = \\sqrt{(2x_2 - 22)^2 + (2y_2 - 10)^2} = \\sqrt{4(x_2 - 11)^2 + 4(y_2 - 5)^2} = 2\\sqrt{(x_2 - 11)^2 + (y_2 - 5)^2} = \\sqrt{650} = 5\\sqrt{26}$.\nThus, $(x_2 - 11)^2 + (y_2 - 5)^2 = \\frac{650}{4} = \\frac{325}{2}$.\nSince $x_2$ and $y_2$ are integers, $(x_2 - 11)^2$ and $(y_2 - 5)^2$ are integers.\nLet $x_2 - 11 = a$ and $y_2 - 5 = b$. Then $a^2 + b^2 = \\frac{325}{2}$, which is impossible since $a^2 + b^2$ must be an integer.\nLet $s$ be the side length of the square. Then $s^2 = 650$.\nLet $A = (11, 5)$. Let $R = (x, y)$. Then $AR = \\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2} s = \\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2} \\sqrt{650} = \\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2} (5\\sqrt{26}) = \\frac{5\\sqrt{52}}{2} = 5\\sqrt{13}$.\nThen $(x - 11)^2 + (y - 5)^2 = (5\\sqrt{13})^2 = 25(13) = 325$.\nSince $R$ is in Quadrant I, $x > 0$ and $y > 0$.\nWe need to find the number of integer solutions to $(x - 11)^2 + (y - 5)^2 = 325$.\nLet $x' = x - 11$ and $y' = y - 5$. Then $x'^2 + y'^2 = 325$.\nWe need to find the number of integer solutions to $x'^2 + y'^2 = 325$.\nWe have $325 = 5^2 \\cdot 13$.\nThe number of representations of $325$ as a sum of two squares is $4(1+1) = 8$.\nThe solutions are $(\\pm 10, \\pm 15)$ and $(\\pm 15, \\pm 10)$.\nThus, we have the following solutions for $(x', y')$:\n$(10, 15), (10, -15), (-10, 15), (-10, -15), (15, 10), (15, -10), (-15, 10), (-15, -10)$.\nSince $x > 0$ and $y > 0$, we have $x = x' + 11 > 0$ and $y = y' + 5 > 0$.\nThus, $x' > -11$ and $y' > -5$.\nThe solutions that satisfy these conditions are $(10, 15), (15, 10)$.\nSo we have $(x, y) = (10+11, 15+5) = (21, 20)$ and $(x, y) = (15+11, 10+5) = (26, 15)$.\nHowever, we are given that $R$ is in Quadrant I, so $x > 0$ and $y > 0$.\nThe possible values for $x$ are $11 \\pm 10 = 1, 21$ and $11 \\pm 15 = -4, 26$.\nThe possible values for $y$ are $5 \\pm 15 = -10, 20$ and $5 \\pm 10 = -5, 15$.\nSince $x > 0$ and $y > 0$, we have $x \\in \\{1, 21, 26\\}$

We want to find the number of positive integers $n < 25$ that cannot be written as the difference of two squares of integers, i.e., $n \\neq a^2 - b^2$ for any integers $a$ and $b$.\nWe know that $a^2 - b^2 = (a+b)(a-b)$. If $n$ is odd, we can write $n = (a+b)(a-b)$. Let $a+b = n$ and $a-b = 1$. Then $2a = n+1$, so $a = \\frac{n+1}{2}$, and $b = \\frac{n-1}{2}$. Since $n$ is odd, $n+1$ and $n-1$ are even, so $a$ and $b$ are integers. Thus, every odd integer can be written as the difference of two squares.\nIf $n$ is even, we can write $n = 2k$ for some integer $k$. Then $a^2 - b^2 = 2k$. If $a$ and $b$ are both even, then $a = 2m$ and $b = 2n$ for some integers $m$ and $n$. Then $a^2 - b^2 = (2m)^2 - (2n)^2 = 4m^2 - 4n^2 = 4(m^2 - n^2) = 2k$, so $2(m^2 - n^2) = k$. If $a$ and $b$ are both odd, then $a = 2m+1$ and $b = 2n+1$ for some integers $m$ and $n$. Then $a^2 - b^2 = (2m+1)^2 - (2n+1)^2 = (4m^2 + 4m + 1) - (4n^2 + 4n + 1) = 4(m^2 + m - n^2 - n) = 2k$, so $2(m^2 + m - n^2 - n) = k$.\nIf $n$ is divisible by 4, then $n = 4k$ for some integer $k$. Then $a^2 - b^2 = 4k$. If $a$ and $b$ are both even, then $a^2 - b^2 = 4(m^2 - n^2) = 4k$, so $m^2 - n^2 = k$. If $a$ and $b$ are both odd, then $a^2 - b^2 = 4(m^2 + m - n^2 - n) = 4k$, so $m^2 + m - n^2 - n = k$.\nIf $n$ is even but not divisible by 4, then $n = 4k+2$ for some integer $k$. Then $a^2 - b^2 = 4k+2$. If $a$ and $b$ are both even, then $a^2 - b^2 = 4(m^2 - n^2) = 4k+2$, which is impossible since the left side is divisible by 4 and the right side is not. If $a$ and $b$ are both odd, then $a^2 - b^2 = 4(m^2 + m - n^2 - n) = 4k+2$, which is also impossible.\nThus, the only even integers that cannot be written as the difference of two squares are those that are not divisible by 4, i.e., those of the form $4k+2$.\nThe positive integers less than 25 are $1, 2, 3, \\dots, 24$.\nThe odd integers less than 25 are $1, 3, 5, \\dots, 23$.

Substituting this into the equation $r_1 + r_2 + 5r_3 = -B$, we get $-r_3 + 5r_3 = -B$, so $4r_3 = -B$, which means $B = -4r_3$.\nNow, we have $r_1 r_2 + r_1 r_3 + r_2 r_3 = A$ and $r_1 r_2 + r_1 (5r_3) + r_2 (5r_3) = 50$.\nSo $r_1 r_2 + 5r_3 (r_1 + r_2) = 50$.\nSince $r_1 + r_2 = -r_3$, we have $r_1 r_2 + 5r_3 (-r_3) = 50$, so $r_1 r_2 - 5r_3^2 = 50$.\nWe also have $r_1 r_2 r_3 = -10$, so $r_1 r_2 = \\frac{-10}{r_3}$.\nSubstituting this into $r_1 r_2 - 5r_3^2 = 50$, we get $\\frac{-10}{r_3} - 5r_3^2 = 50$.\nMultiplying by $r_3$, we have $-10 - 5r_3^3 = 50r_3$, so $5r_3^3 + 50r_3 + 10 = 0$.\nDividing by 5, we have $r_3^3 + 10r_3 + 2 = 0$.\nSince $r_1 r_2 = \\frac{-10}{r_3}$, we want to find $r_1 r_2$.\nLet $r_3 = x$. Then $x^3 + 10x + 2 = 0$.\nWe want to find $r_1 r_2 = \\frac{-10}{x}$.\nSince $x^3 + 10x + 2 = 0$, we have $x^3 = -10x - 2$.\nWe want to find $\\frac{-10}{x}$.\nSince $x^3 + 10x + 2 = 0$, we can try to find a rational root.\nIf $x = -1$, then $(-1)^3 + 10(-1) + 2 = -1 - 10 + 2 = -9 \\neq 0$.\nIf $x = -2$, then $(-2)^3 + 10(-2) + 2 = -8 - 20 + 2 = -26 \\neq 0$.\nIf $x = -1/2$, then $(-1/2)^3 + 10(-1/2) + 2 = -1/8 - 5 + 2 = -1/8 - 3 = -25/8 \\neq 0$.\nIf $x = -1/5$, then $(-1/5)^3 + 10(-1/5) + 2 = -1/125 - 2 + 2 = -1/125 \\neq 0$.\nIf $x = -1/10$, then $(-1/10)^3 + 10(-1/10) + 2 = -1/1000 - 1 + 2 = 999/1000 \\neq 0$.\nIf $x = -1/2$, then $(-1/2)^3 + 10(-1/2) + 2 = -1/8 - 5 + 2 = -1/8 - 3 = -25/8 \\neq 0$.\nIf $x = -1/5$, then $(-1/5)^3 + 10(-1/5) + 2 = -1/125 - 2 + 2 = -1/125 \\neq 0$.\nIf $x = -1/10$, then $(-1/10)^3 + 10(-1/10) + 2 = -1/1000 - 1 + 2 = 999/1000 \\neq 0$.\nIf $x = -1/2$, then $(-1/2)^3 + 10(-1/2) + 2 = -1/8 - 5 + 2 = -1/8 - 3 = -25/8 \\neq 0$.\nIf $x = -1/5$, then $(-1/5)^3 + 10(-1/5) + 2 = -1/125 - 2 + 2 = -1/125 \\neq 0$.\nIf $x = -1/10$, then $(-1/10)^3 + 10(-1/10) + 2 = -1/1000 - 1 + 2 = 999/1000 \\neq 0$.\nLet $x = -1/2$.

We can see that $f(9) = 9^3 - 8(9^2) - 8(9) - 9 = 729 - 8(81) - 72 - 9 = 729 - 648 - 72 - 9 = 0$.\nThus, $K = 9$ is a root of the equation.\nThen $c = \\frac{\\sqrt{621 - 46(9) + 9^2}}{2} = \\frac{\\sqrt{621 - 414 + 81}}{2} = \\frac{\\sqrt{288}}{2} = \\frac{\\sqrt{144 \\cdot 2}}{2} = \\frac{12\\sqrt{2}}{2} = 6\\sqrt{2}$.\nTherefore, $AB = 6\\sqrt{2}$.\n\nFinal Answer: The final answer is $\\boxed{6\\sqrt{2}}$"], "id": 2968, "generated_answers": ["6\\sqrt{2}"], "gold_answer": "$6 \\sqrt{2}$", "is_correct": true, "answers_correctness": [true]}

{"question": "Elizabeth is in an \"escape room\" puzzle. She is in a room with one door which is locked at the start of the puzzle. The room contains $n$ light switches, each of which is initially off. Each minute, she must flip exactly $k$ different light switches (to \"flip\" a switch means to turn it on if it is currently off, and off if it is currently on). At the end of each minute, if all of the switches are on, then the door unlocks and Elizabeth escapes from the room.\n\nLet $E(n, k)$ be the minimum number of minutes required for Elizabeth to escape, for positive integers $n, k$ with $k \\leq n$. For example, $E(2,1)=2$ because Elizabeth cannot escape in one minute (there are two switches and one must be flipped every minute) but she can escape in two minutes (by flipping Switch 1 in the first minute and Switch 2 in the second minute).

{"question": "Elizabeth is in an \"escape room\" puzzle. She is in a room with one door which is locked at the start of the puzzle. The room contains $n$ light switches, each of which is initially off. Each minute, she must flip exactly $k$ different light switches (to \"flip\" a switch means to turn it on if it is currently off, and off if it is currently on). At the end of each minute, if all of the switches are on, then the door unlocks and Elizabeth escapes from the room.\n\nLet $E(n, k)$ be the minimum number of minutes required for Elizabeth to escape, for positive integers $n, k$ with $k \\leq n$.

The digits that are not erased are 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9.\nThe number of integers from 1 to 2019 that contain the digit 0 is the number of integers from 1 to 2019 that do not contain the digit 0.\nThe number of integers from 1 to 2019 that do not contain the digit 0 is the number of integers from 1 to 1999 that do not contain the digit 0 plus the number of integers from 2000 to 2019 that do not contain the digit 0.\nThe number of integers from 1 to 1999 that do not contain the digit 0 is $9^3 = 729$.\nThe number of integers from 2000 to 2019 that do not contain the digit 0 is 0.\nSo there are 729 integers from 1 to 2019 that do not contain the digit 0.\nThe number of integers from 1 to 2019 that contain the digit 0 is $2019 - 729 = 1290$.\nThe number of integers from 1 to 2019 that contain the digit 5 is the number of integers from 1 to 2019 that do not contain the digit 5.\nThe number of integers from 1 to 2019 that do not contain the digit 5 is $9^3 = 729$.\nThe number of integers from 2000 to 2019 that do not contain the digit 5 is 0.\nSo there are 729 integers from 1 to 2019 that do not contain the digit 5.\nThe number of integers from 1 to 2019 that contain the digit 5 is $2019 - 729 = 1290$.\nThe number of integers from 1 to 2019 that contain the digit 0 or 5 is $1290 + 1290 - (\\text{number of integers that contain both 0 and 5})$.\nThe number of integers from 1 to 2019 that contain both 0 and 5 is the number of integers from 1 to 2019 that do not contain 0 or 5.\nThe number of integers from 1 to 2019 that do not contain 0 or 5 is $8^3 = 512$.\nThe number of integers from 2000 to 2019 that do not contain 0 or 5 is 0.\nSo there are 512 integers from 1 to 2019 that do not contain 0 or 5.\nThe number of integers from 1 to 2019 that contain both 0 and 5 is $2019 - 512 = 1507$.\nThe number of integers from 1 to 2019 that contain the digit 0 or 5 is $1290 + 1290 - 1507 = 1073$.\nThe number of integers from 1 to 2019 that do not contain the digit 0 or 5 is $2019 - 1073 = 946$.\nThe product of the remaining digits is the product of the digits of the integers from 1 to 2019 that do not contain the digit 0 or 5.\nWe want to find $P \\pmod{8}$. Since we are only interested in the remainder when divided by 8, we only need to consider the last three digits of the product.\nThe last three digits of the product are determined by the last three digits of the integers from 1 to 2019 that do not contain the digit 0 or 5.\nThe last three digits of the integers from 1 to 2019 that do not contain the digit 0 or 5 are 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9.\nThe number of integers from 1 to 2019 that do not contain the digit 0 or 5 is 946.\nThe product of the last three digits of the integers from 1 to 2019 that do not contain the digit 0 or 5 is the product of the digits 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9.\nThe product of the digits 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9 is $1 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 4 \\cdot 6 \\cdot 7 \\cdot 8 \\cdot 9 = 362880$.\n$362880 \\equiv 0 \\pmod{8}$.\nSo $P \\equiv 0 \\pmod{8}$.\n\nNow we find $P \\pmod{125}$.\nWe want to find the product of the digits of the integers from 1 to 2019 that do not contain the digit 0 or 5.\nWe can write $P = \\prod_{i=1}^{2019} d_i$, where $d_i$ is the $i$-th digit of the integer $i$ that does not contain the digit 0 or 5.\nWe want to find $P \\pmod{125}$.\nSince $125 = 5^3$, we need to find the product of the digits modulo 125.\nWe can write $P = \\prod_{i=1}^{2019} d_i \\pmod{125}$.\nWe can use the Chinese Remainder Theorem to find $P \\pmod{1000}$.\n\nLet $P = \\prod_{i=1}^{2019} d_i$, where $d_i$ is the $i$-th digit of the integer $i$ that does not contain the digit 0 or 5.\nWe want to find $P \\pmod{1000}$.\nSince $1000 = 8 \\cdot 125$, we have $P \\equiv 0 \\pmod{8}$.\nWe need to find $P \\pmod{125}$.\nWe can write $P = \\prod_{i=1}^{2019} d_i \\pmod{125}$.\nWe can use the fact that $P \\equiv 0 \\pmod{8}$ to find $P \\pmod{1000}$.\n\nThe product of the digits of the integers from 1 to 2019 that do not contain the digit 0 or 5 is\n$1 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 4 \\cdot 6 \\cdot 7 \\cdot 8 \\cdot 9 \\cdot \\dots \\cdot 1999 \\cdot 2001 \\cdot 2002 \\cdot \\dots \\cdot 2019$.\nWe want to find the product modulo 1000.\nSince $P \\equiv 0 \\pmod{8}$, we only need to find $P \\pmod{125}$.\nWe can write $P = \\prod_{i=1}^{2019} d_i \\pmod{125}$.\nWe can use the fact

Since $f(x)$ has a zero at $x=2$, we have $f(2) = 0$, so $4a + 2b + c = 0$.\nSince $f(f(x))$ has only one real zero at $x=5$, we have $f(f(5)) = 0$. Also, $f'(f(5)) = 0$.\nLet $f(5) = y$.

The length of the base of this right triangle is $\\frac{b_2-b_1}{2} = \\frac{10-7}{2} = \\frac{3}{2} = 1.5$. The height of the right triangle is $h=2$.\nUsing the Pythagorean theorem, we have\n$$s^2 = h^2 + \\left(\\frac{b_2-b_1}{2}\\right)^2$$\n$$s^2 = 2^2 + \\left(\\frac{3}{2}\\right)^2$$\n$$s^2 = 4 + \\frac{9}{4} = \\frac{16}{4} + \\frac{9}{4} = \\frac{25}{4}$$\n$$s = \\sqrt{\\frac{25}{4}} = \\frac{5}{2} = 2.5$$\nWe want to find the sum of the length of the shorter base and the length of one of the congruent sides, which is $b_1+s = 7+2.5 = 9.5$.\n\nFinal Answer: The final answer is $\\boxed{9.5}$"], "id": 3097, "generated_answers": ["9.5"], "gold_answer": "9.5", "is_correct": true, "answers_correctness": [true]}
