{"question": "If $f(x)$ is a polynomial of degree 7, and $g(x)$ is a polynomial of degree 7, then what is the product of the minimum and the maximum possible degrees of $f(x) + g(x)$?", "generated_responses": ["Let $f(x)$ and $g(x)$ be polynomials of degree 7. We want to find the minimum and maximum possible degrees of $f(x) + g(x)$.\nLet $f(x) = a_7 x^7 + a_6 x^6 + \\dots + a_1 x + a_0$ and $g(x) = b_7 x^7 + b_6 x^6 + \\dots + b_1 x + b_0$, where $a_7 \\neq 0$ and $b_7 \\neq 0$.\nThen $f(x) + g(x) = (a_7 + b_7) x^7 + (a_6 + b_6) x^6 + \\dots + (a_1 + b_1) x + (a_0 + b_0)$.\nThe degree of $f(x) + g(x)$ is the highest power of $x$ with a non-zero coefficient.\nThe maximum possible degree of $f(x) + g(x)$ occurs when $a_7 + b_7 \\neq 0$. In this case, the degree of $f(x) + g(x)$ is 7.\nThe minimum possible degree of $f(x) + g(x)$ occurs when $a_7 + b_7 = 0$, $a_6 + b_6 = 0$, ..., $a_1 + b_1 = 0$, $a_0 + b_0 \\neq 0$.\nIn this case, $f(x) + g(x) = (a_0 + b_0)$, which is a constant polynomial. The degree of a constant polynomial is 0.\nHowever, if $a_7 + b_7 = 0$, $a_6 + b_6 = 0$, ..., $a_1 + b_1 = 0$, and $a_0 + b_0 = 0$, then $f(x) + g(x) = 0$, which is the zero polynomial. The degree of the zero polynomial is undefined.\nIf $a_7 + b_7 = 0$, $a_6 + b_6 = 0$, ..., $a_1 + b_1 = 0$, and $a_0 + b_0 \\neq 0$, then $f(x) + g(x) = a_0 + b_0$, which is a constant polynomial. The degree is 0.\nIf $a_7 + b_7 = 0$, $a_6 + b_6 = 0$, ..., $a_1 + b_1 = 0$, and $a_0 + b_0 = 0$, then $f(x) + g(x) = 0$.\nIf $a_7 + b_7 = 0$, $a_6 + b_6 = 0$, ..., $a_1 + b_1 = 0$, and $a_0 + b_0 \\neq 0$, then $f(x) + g(x) = a_0 + b_0$, which is a constant polynomial.
