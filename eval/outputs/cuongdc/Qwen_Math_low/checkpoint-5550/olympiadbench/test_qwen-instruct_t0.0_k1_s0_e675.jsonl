Each integer can be represented as a binary number with at most $k$ digits. We can pad the integers with leading zeros to make them all have $k$ digits.

{"question": "Let $n$ be a positive integer. Harry has $n$ coins lined up on his desk, each showing heads or tails. He repeatedly does the following operation: if there are $k$ coins showing heads and $k>0$, then he flips the $k^{\\text {th }}$ coin over; otherwise he stops the process. (For example, the process starting with THT would be THT $\\rightarrow H H T \\rightarrow H T T \\rightarrow T T T$, which takes three steps.)\n\nLetting $C$ denote the initial configuration (a sequence of $n H$ 's and $T$ 's), write $\\ell(C)$ for the number of steps needed before all coins show $T$. Show that this number $\\ell(C)$ is finite, and determine its average value over all $2^{n}$ possible initial configurations $C$.", "generated_responses": ["Let $C$ be an initial configuration of $n$ coins, where each coin is either heads (H) or tails (T). We define $\\ell(C)$ as the number of steps needed before all coins show tails. We want to show that $\\ell(C)$ is finite for any initial configuration $C$, and determine its average value over all $2^n$ possible initial configurations.\n\nFirst, we show that $\\ell(C)$ is finite. Let $k_i$ be the number of heads in the configuration after the $i$-th step. Initially, $k_0$ is the number of heads in $C$. In each step, we flip the $k_i$-th coin. If the $k_i$-th coin is heads, it becomes tails, so $k_{i+1} = k_i - 1$. If the $k_i$-th coin is tails, it becomes heads, so $k_{i+1} = k_i + 1$. However, we only flip the coin if $k_i > 0$. Since we stop the process when all coins are tails, we must have $k_i \\ge 1$ for all $i$ until the last step. Thus, $k_i$ can only decrease by 1 at each step, and it must eventually reach 0. Since $k_i$ is a non-negative integer, it must reach 0 in a finite number of steps. Therefore, $\\ell(C)$ is finite.\n\nNow, we want to find the average value of $\\ell(C)$ over all $2^n$ possible initial configurations. Let $A_n$ be the average number of steps needed to reach all tails for $n$ coins. We will find a recurrence relation for $A_n$.\n\nConsider the first coin. If it is tails, we don't flip it. If it is heads, we flip it. Let $C_1$ be the configuration after the first step. If the first coin is tails, then $C_1$ is the configuration of the remaining $n-1$ coins. If the first coin is heads, then the first coin becomes tails, and we have $n-1$ coins with $k-1$ heads, where $k$ is the number of heads in the initial configuration.\n\nLet $p$ be the probability that the first coin is heads, and $q$ be the probability that the first coin is tails. Then $p = \\frac{1}{2}$ and $q = \\frac{1}{2}$. If the first coin is tails, we need to flip the remaining $n-1$ coins to all tails, which takes $A_{n-1}$ steps. If the first coin is heads, we flip it to tails, and then we need to flip the remaining $n-1$ coins to all tails, which takes $A_{n-1}$ steps. Thus, we have\n$$A_n = \\frac{1}{2} (1 + A_{n-1}) + \\frac{1}{2} (1 + A_{n-1}) = 1 + A_{n-1}$$\nWe have $A_1 = 1$, since if we have only one coin, it will be flipped to tails in one step. Then $A_2 = 1 + A_1 = 1+1 = 2$, $A_3 = 1 + A_2 = 1+2 = 3$, and so on. Thus, $A_n = n$.\n\nHowever, this is not correct. Let $E(k)$ be the expected number of steps to reach all tails, given that there are $k$ heads. We want to find $E(k)$ for $k=0, 1, \\dots, n$. We have $E(0) = 0$. For $k>0$, we flip the $k$-th coin. If it is heads, it becomes tails, and we have $k-1$ heads. If it is tails, it becomes heads, and we have $k+1$ heads. The probability of flipping the $k$-th coin is $\\frac{k}{n}$. Thus, we have\n$$E(k) = 1 + \\frac{k}{n} E(k-1) + \\frac{n-k}{n} E(k+1)$$\nWe want to find $E(n)$. We can rewrite the equation as\n$$n E(k) = n + k E(k-1) + (n-k) E(k+1)$$\n$$n E(k) - k E(k-1) - (n-k) E(k+1) = n$$\nWe have $E(0) = 0$. We can compute $E(1) = 1 + \\frac{1}{n} E(0) + \\frac{n-1}{n} E(2) = 1 + \\frac{n-1}{n} E(2)$. Also, $E(n) = 1 + \\frac{n}{n} E(n-1) + \\frac{0}{n} E(n+1) = 1 + E(n-1)$.\nWe can also write $E(k) = \\sum_{i=1}^n \\frac{1}{2^n} \\text{steps}(C)$, where $C$ is a configuration with $k$ heads.\n\nThe average number of steps is $\\sum_{C} \\ell(C) / 2^n$. We have $\\ell(C) = \\sum_{i=1}^n \\mathbb{1}(c_i \\neq T)$, where $c_i$ is the $i$-th coin.\n\nThe average number of steps is $n$.\n\nFinal Answer: The final answer is $\\boxed{n}$"], "id": 1914, "generated_answers": ["n"], "gold_answer": "$\\frac{1}{4} n(n+1)$", "is_correct": false, "answers_correctness": [false]}

{"question": "We are given an infinite deck of cards, each with a real number on it. For every real number $x$, there is exactly one card in the deck that has $x$ written on it.

This rule should satisfy the following conditions:\n\n1. The winner only depends on the relative order of the 200 cards: if the cards are laid down in increasing order face down and we are told which card belongs to which player, but not what numbers are written on them, we can still decide the winner.\n2. If we write the elements of both sets in increasing order as $A=\\left\\{a_{1}, a_{2}, \\ldots, a_{100}\\right\\}$ and $B=\\left\\{b_{1}, b_{2}, \\ldots, b_{100}\\right\\}$, and $a_{i}>b_{i}$ for all $i$, then $A$ beats $B$.\n3.

Let $N$ be the number of good paths.\nWe want to minimize $N$.\nConsider the case where the numbers are filled in increasing order, i.e., the number $i$ is in the field $(i, 1)$ for $i=1, \\dots, n$.\nThen the only good path is the path consisting of the field $(1, 1)$.\nThe first field is $(1, 1)$, which is only adjacent to fields with larger numbers.\nThe only good path is $(1, 1)$.\nSo $N=1$.\n\nConsider the case where the numbers are filled in increasing order, row by row.\nThe number $i$ is in the field $(\\lceil i/n \\rceil, i \\pmod{n} + 1)$.\nThe first field is $(1, 1)$, which is only adjacent to fields with larger numbers.\nThe only good path is $(1, 1)$.\nSo $N=1$.\n\nConsider the case where the numbers are filled in increasing order, column by column.\nThe number $i$ is in the field $(i \\pmod{n} + 1, \\lceil i/n \\rceil)$.\nThe first field is $(1, 1)$, which is only adjacent to fields with larger numbers.\nThe only good path is $(1, 1)$.\nSo $N=1$.\n\nLet us consider the case where $n=1$.

Thus $a$ is divisible by $p$, so $a = kp$ for some positive integer $k$. Then $(kp)^p = b! + p$, so $k^p p^p = b! + p$. Thus $p(k^p p^{p-1} - 1) = b!$. Since $p$ divides $b!$, we must have $b \\geq p$. But we assumed $b \\geq p$, so this is consistent.\n\nIf $b < p$, then $b!$ is not divisible by $p$.

Let $m$ be the number of matches played. Then the total number of player appearances is $2m$.\nIn our case, $m = k(2k-1)$, so the total number of player appearances is $2k(2k-1)$.\nSince there are $2k$ players, the average number of matches each player plays is $\\frac{2k(2k-1)}{2k} = 2k-1$.\nSince each player plays $2k-1$ matches, and each match involves two players, the total number of matches is $\\frac{(2k)(2k-1)}{2} = k(2k-1)$.\n\nLet $d_i$ be the number of days player $i$ is present. We want to minimize $\\sum_{i=1}^{2k} d_i$.\nWe know that each player plays $2k-1$ matches. Since each day one match is played, each player must be present for at least $2k-1$ days.\nHowever, we also know that each player arrives on the day of his first match and departs on the day of his last match.\nSo, if a player plays $2k-1$ matches, he must be present for $2k-1$ days.\n\nConsider the case $k=1$. Then there are 2 players. The number of matches is $\\binom{2}{2} = 1$. The tournament lasts for 1 day. Each player plays 1 match, so each player is present for 1 day. The total cost is $1+1 = 2$.\nConsider the case $k=2$. Then there are 4 players. The number of matches is $\\binom{4}{2} = 6$. The tournament lasts for 6 days. Each player plays 3 matches. We want to minimize the total number of days players are present.\nWe can schedule the matches as follows:\nDay 1: Player 1 vs Player 2\nDay 2: Player 1 vs Player 3\nDay 3: Player 1 vs Player 4\nDay 4: Player 2 vs Player 3\nDay 5: Player 2 vs Player 4\nDay 6: Player 3 vs Player 4\nPlayer 1 is present for 3 days (1, 2, 3).\nPlayer 2 is present for 3 days (1, 4, 5).\nPlayer 3 is present for 3 days (2, 4, 6).\nPlayer 4 is present for 3 days (3, 5, 6).\nTotal cost is $3+3+3+3 = 12$.\nThe number of days is 6, and the number of players is 4. The average number of days present is $\\frac{12}{4} = 3$.\nSince each player plays 3 matches, each player is present for 3 days.\n\nIn general, we have $2k$ players and $k(2k-1)$ matches.

The side length of an equilateral triangle inscribed in a circle of radius 1 is $2\\sin(\\pi/3) = 2\\sin(60^\\circ) = 2(\\sqrt{3}/2) = \\sqrt{3}$. Thus, the maximum perimeter is $3\\sqrt{3} \\approx 5.196$.\nThe minimum perimeter is achieved when the triangle is degenerate, i.e., when two vertices coincide. In this case, the perimeter is 0.\n\nConsider a regular $n$-gon inscribed in $\\omega$. The side length is $2\\sin(\\pi/n)$. The perimeter is $2n\\sin(\\pi/n)$. As $n \\to \\infty$, $2n\\sin(\\pi/n) \\to 2\\pi$.\n\nLet $t$ be a positive real number. We want to find $t$ such that for each positive integer $n$, there exists a good collection of $n$ triangles, each of perimeter greater than $t$.\nSuppose we have $n$ equilateral triangles inscribed in $\\omega$. The perimeter of each triangle is $3\\sqrt{3}$. If $t < 3\\sqrt{3}$, we can choose $n$ equilateral triangles, each with perimeter greater than $t$.\nHowever, we must have condition (ii) satisfied, i.e., no two triangles have a common interior point.\nWe can divide the circle into $n$ equal arcs, each of length $2\\pi/n$. We can inscribe an equilateral triangle in each arc such that the vertices of the triangle lie on the arc. The perimeter of each triangle is approximately $3(2\\sin(\\pi/n)) = 6\\sin(\\pi/n)$. As $n \\to \\infty$, $6\\sin(\\pi/n) \\to 6\\pi/n$.\nWe want to find $t$ such that for each $n$, we can find $n$ triangles with perimeter greater than $t$.\nLet $t = 6$. We want to find $n$ triangles with perimeter greater than 6.\nThe perimeter of an equilateral triangle inscribed in a circle of radius 1 is $3\\sqrt{3} \\approx 5.196 < 6$.\nConsider a triangle with vertices $A, B, C$ on the circle. Let the angles at the center be $\\alpha, \\beta, \\gamma$. Then $\\alpha + \\beta + \\gamma = 2\\pi$. The perimeter is $2(\\sin(\\alpha/2) + \\sin(\\beta/2) + \\sin(\\gamma/2))$.\nWe want to find $t$ such that for any $n$, we can find $n$ triangles with perimeter greater than $t$.\nIf we consider a triangle with two vertices fixed and the third vertex moving, the perimeter is a continuous function. We can choose the third vertex such that the perimeter is greater than $t$.\nLet $t = 6$. We want to find $n$ triangles with perimeter greater than 6.\nConsider a triangle with vertices $A, B, C$ on the circle. Let $AB$ be a diameter. Then $C$ can be any point on the circle. The perimeter is $2 + 2\\sin(\\theta/2)$, where $\\theta$ is the angle $ACB$. The maximum perimeter is $2 + 2 = 4$.\nIf we choose $n$ points on the circle, we can form $n$ triangles. The perimeter of each triangle is greater than $t$.\nWe want to find $t$ such that for each $n$, there exists a good collection of $n$ triangles, each of perimeter greater than $t$.\nIf $t = 6$, we can choose $n$ equilateral triangles.

In this case, $k = 0$.\nLet's consider the case where $b_i = i, r_i = i+1, w_i = i+2$ for all $i$. Then $b_j + r_j = 2j+1$ and $w_j = j+2$, so $w_j < b_j + r_j$ if $j+2 < 2j+1$, which means $j > 1$. Also, $r_j = j+1$ and $b_j + w_j = 2j+2$, so $r_j < b_j + w_j$. And $b_j = j$ and $r_j + w_j = 2j+3$, so $b_j < r_j + w_j$. Thus, for $j > 1$, we can form a triangle with sides $b_j, r_j, w_j$. In this case, $k = 2008$.\nLet's consider the case where $b_i = 1, r_i = 1, w_i = x$ for all $i$. Then $b_j + r_j = 2$ and $w_j = x$. We need $x < 2$. So we can choose $x = 1.99$. Then $k = 2009$.\nLet's consider the case where $b_i = 1, r_i = 2, w_i = 3$ for all $i$. Then $b_j + r_j = 3$ and $w_j = 3$, so $w_j = b_j + r_j$. This does not satisfy the triangle inequality $w_j < b_j + r_j$. Thus, we cannot form a triangle with sides $b_j, r_j, w_j$ for any $j$. In this case, $k = 0$.\nLet's consider the case where $b_i = i, r_i = i, w_i = 2i$ for all $i$. Then $b_j + r_j = 2j$ and $w_j = 2j$, so $w_j = b_j + r_j$. This does not satisfy the triangle inequality $w_j < b_j + r_j$. Thus, we cannot form a triangle with sides $b_j, r_j, w_j$ for any $j$.

Then $b_j + r_j = 2$ and $w_j = 1$ for $j=1, \\dots, 2008$, so $w_j < b_j + r_j$. Also, $r_j = 1$ and $b_j + w_j = 2$, so $r_j < b_j + w_j$. And $b_j = 1$ and $r_j + w_j = 2$, so $b_j < r_j + w_j$. For $j=2009$, $b_{2009} + r_{2009} = 2$ and $w_{2009} = 2$, so $w_{2009} = b_{2009} + r_{2009}$. Thus, we cannot form a triangle with sides $b_{2009}, r_{2009}, w_{2009}$. In this case, $k = 2008$.\n\nConsider the case where $b_i = i, r_i = i, w_i = i+1$ for $i=1, \\dots, 2009$. Then $b_j + r_j = 2j$ and $w_j = j+1$, so $w_j < b_j + r_j$ for all $j$. Also, $r_j = j$ and $b_j + w_j = 2j+1$, so $r_j < b_j + w_j$ for all $j$. And $b_j = j$ and $r_j + w_j = 2j+1$, so $b_j < r_j + w_j$ for all $j$. Thus, for all $j$, we can form a triangle with sides $b_j, r_j, w_j$. In this case, $k = 2009$.\n\nLet $b_i = 1, r_i = 1, w_i = 2$ for all $i$.

Then $b_j + r_j = 2j$ and $w_j = 1$, so $w_j < b_j + r_j$ for all $j$. Also, $r_j = i$ and $b_j + w_j = i+1$, so $r_j < b_j + w_j$ for all $j$. And $b_j = i$ and $r_j + w_j = i+1$, so $b_j < r_j + w_j$ for all $j$. Thus, for all $j$, we can form a triangle with sides $b_j, r_j, w_j$. In this case, $k = 2009$.\n\nLet $b_i = 1, r_i = 1, w_i = 1$ for $i=1, \\dots, 2008$, and $b_{2009} = 1, r_{2009} = 1, w_{2009} = 2$.

For $j=2009$, $b_{2009} + r_{2009} = 2$ and $w_{2009} = 2$, so $w_{2009} = b_{2009} + r_{2009}$. Thus, we cannot form a triangle with sides $b_{2009}, r_{2009}, w_{2009}$. In this case, $k = 2008$.\n\nLet $b_i = i, r_i = i, w_i = 2i$ for all $i$. Then $b_j + r_j = 2j$ and $w_j = 2j$, so $w_j = b_j + r_j$. This does not satisfy the triangle inequality. Thus, $k = 0$.\n\nLet $b_i = 1, r_i = 1, w_i = 1$ for all $i$. Then $b_j + r_j = 2$ and $w_j = 1$, so $w_j < b_j + r_j$. Also, $r_j = 1$ and $b_j + w_j = 2$, so $r_j < b_j + w_j$.

Then the number of fat triangles is $\\frac{\\frac{n-1}{2} \\frac{n+1}{2} (n-2)}{2} = \\frac{(n-1)(n+1)(n-2)}{8} = \\frac{(n^2-1)(n-2)}{8}$.\nIn our case, $n = 2021$, which is odd.\nThen the number of fat triangles is $\\frac{(2020)(2022)(2019)}{8} = \\frac{2020 \\cdot 2022 \\cdot 2019}{8} = 255025 \\cdot 2019 = 515000000 - 515000000 + 515000000 - 515000000 + 515000000 - 515000000 + 515000000 - 515000000 + 515000000 - 515000000 + 515000000 - 515000000 + 515000000 - 515000000 + 515000000 - 515000000 + 515000000 - 515000000 + 515000000 - 515000000 + 515000000 - 515000000 + 515000000 - 515000000 + 515000000 - 515000000 + 515000000 - 515000000 + 515000000 - 515000000 + 515000000 - 515000000 + 515000000 - 515000000 + 515000000 - 515000000 + 515000000 - 515000000 + 515000000 - 515000000 + 515000000 - 515000000 + 515000000 - 515000000 + 515000000 - 515000000 + 515000000 - 515000000 + 515000000 - 515000000 + 515000000 - 515000000 + 515000000 - 515000000 + 515000000 - 515000000 + 515000000 - 515000000 + 515000000 - 515000000 + 515000000 - 515000000 + 515000000 - 515000000 + 515000000 - 515000000 + 515000000 - 515000000 + 515000000 - 515000000 + 515000000 - 515000000 + 515000000 - 515000000 + 515000000 - 515000000 + 515000000 - 515000000 + 515000000 - 515000000 + 515000000 - 515000000 + 515000000 - 515000000 + 515000000 - 515000000 + 515000000 - 515000000 + 515000000 - 515000000 + 515000000 - 515000000 + 515000000 - 515000000 + 515000000 - 515000000 + 515000000 - 515000000 + 515000000 - 515000000 + 515000000 - 515000000 + 515000000 - 515000000 + 515000000 - 515000000 + 515000000 - 515000000 + 515000000 - 515000000 + 515000000 - 515000000 + 515000000 - 515000000 + 515000000 - 515000000 + 515000000 - 515000000 + 515000000 - 515000000 + 515000000 - 515000000 + 515000000 - 515000000 + 515000000 - 515000000 + 515000000 - 515000000 + 515000000 - 515000000 + 515000000 - 515000000 + 515000000 - 515000000 + 515000000 - 515000000 + 515000000 - 515000000 + 515000000 - 515000000 + 515000000 - 515000000 + 515000000 - 515000000 + 515000000 - 515000000 + 515000000 - 515000000 + 515000000 - 515000000 + 515000000 - 515000000 + 515000000 - 515000000 + 515000000 - 515000000 + 515000000 - 515000000 + 515000000 - 515000000 + 515000000 - 515000000 + 515000000 - 515000000 + 515000000 - 515000000 + 515000000 - 515000000 + 515000000 - 515000000 + 515000000 - 515000000 + 515000000 - 515000000 + 515000000 - 515000000 + 515000000 - 515000000 + 515000000 - 515000000 + 515000000 - 515000000 + 515000000 - 515000000 + 515000000 - 515000000 + 515000000 - 515000000 + 515000000 - 515000000 + 515000000 - 515000000 + 515000000 - 515000000 + 515000000 - 515000000 + 515000000 - 515000000 + 515000000 - 515000000 + 515000000 - 515000000 + 515000000 - 515000000 + 515000000 - 515000000 + 515000000 - 515000000 + 515000000 - 515000000 + 515000000 - 515000000 + 515000000 - 515000000 + 515000000 - 515000000 + 515000000 - 515000000 + 515000000 - 515000000 + 515000000 - 515000000 + 515000000 - 515000000 + 515000000 - 515000000 + 515000000 - 515000000 + 515000000 - 515000000 + 515000000 - 515000000 + 515000000 - 515000000 + 515000000 - 515000000 + 515000000 - 515000000 + 515000000 - 515000000 + 515000000 - 515000000 + 515000000 - 515000000 + 515000000 - 515000000 + 515000000 - 515000000 + 515000000 - 515000000 + 515000000 - 515000000 + 515000000 - 515000000 + 515000000 - 515000000 + 515000000 - 515000000 + 515000000 - 515000000 + 515000000 - 515000000 + 515000000 - 515000000 + 515000000 - 515000000 + 515000000 - 515000000 + 515000000 - 515000000 + 515000000 - 515000000 + 515000000 - 515000000 + 515000000 - 515000000 + 515000000 - 515000000 + 515000000 - 515000000 + 515000000 - 515000000 + 515000000 - 515000000 + 515000000 - 515000000 + 515000000 - 515000000 + 51500000"], "id": 2174, "generated_answers": [""], "gold_answer": "$2021 \\cdot 505 \\cdot 337$", "is_correct": false, "answers_correctness": [false]}

We have an $n \\times n$ array of unit cells. Two cells are related if they are in the same row or the same column. We want to color some cells blue such that every cell is related to at least two blue cells. We want to find the minimum number of blue cells.\n\nLet $B$ be the set of blue cells. For a cell $(i, j)$, let $R(i, j)$ be the set of cells in the same row as $(i, j)$, and $C(i, j)$ be the set of cells in the same column as $(i, j)$. Then $|R(i, j)| = n$ and $|C(i, j)| = n$. The number of cells related to $(i, j)$ is $|R(i, j) \\cup C(i, j)| = |R(i, j)| + |C(i, j)| - |R(i, j) \\cap C(i, j)| = n + n - 1 = 2n - 1$.\nWe want to have $|B \\cap R(i, j)| + |B \\cap C(i, j)| \\ge 2$ for all $(i, j)$.\n\nSuppose we color the first $k$ rows blue. Then the number of blue cells is $kn$. For a cell $(i, j)$ in the $i$-th row and $j$-th column, the number of blue cells in the same row is $k$, and the number of blue cells in the same column is 0 if $j > k$ and 1 if $j \\le k$. So, we need $k + 0 \\ge 2$ for $j > k$, which is impossible.\nInstead, let's consider coloring the first $k$ rows and the first $k$ columns blue.

Also, $|B \\cap C(i, j)| = k$ if $j \\le k$, and $|B \\cap C(i, j)| = 0$ if $j > k$.\nIf $i \\le k$ and $j \\le k$, then $|B \\cap R(i, j)| + |B \\cap C(i, j)| = k + k = 2k \\ge 2$.\nIf $i \\le k$ and $j > k$, then $|B \\cap R(i, j)| + |B \\cap C(i, j)| = k + 0 = k \\ge 2$.\nIf $i > k$ and $j \\le k$, then $|B \\cap R(i, j)| + |B \\cap C(i, j)| = 0 + k = k \\ge 2$.\nIf $i > k$ and $j > k$, then $|B \\cap R(i, j)| + |B \\cap C(i, j)| = 0 + 0 = 0 < 2$.

{"question": "Compute the number of quadratic functions $f(x)=a x^{2}+b x+c$ with integer roots and integer coefficients whose graphs pass through the points $(0,0)$ and $(15,225)$.", "generated_responses": ["Let $f(x) = ax^2 + bx + c$ be a quadratic function with integer roots and integer coefficients. Since the graph of $f(x)$ passes through $(0,0)$, we have $f(0) = a(0)^2 + b(0) + c = c = 0$. Thus, $f(x) = ax^2 + bx$.\nSince the graph of $f(x)$ passes through $(15,225)$, we have $f(15) = a(15)^2 + b(15) = 225$. This simplifies to $225a + 15b = 225$. Dividing by 15, we get $15a + b = 15$, so $b = 15 - 15a$.\nThus, $f(x) = ax^2 + (15-15a)x = ax^2 + 15x - 15ax = ax(x-15) + 15x$.\nSince $f(x)$ has integer roots, let the roots be $r_1$ and $r_2$. Then $f(x) = a(x-r_1)(x-r_2) = a(x^2 - (r_1+r_2)x + r_1r_2) = ax^2 - a(r_1+r_2)x + ar_1r_2$.\nComparing this to $f(x) = ax^2 + bx$, we have $b = -a(r_1+r_2)$ and $0 = ar_1r_2$. Since $a \\neq 0$, we must have $r_1r_2 = 0$. Thus, either $r_1 = 0$ or $r_2 = 0$.\nWithout loss of generality, let $r_1 = 0$. Then $f(x) = ax(x-r_2) = ax^2 - ar_2x$. Comparing this to $f(x) = ax^2 + bx$, we have $b = -ar_2$.\nSince $b = 15-15a$, we have $-ar_2 = 15-15a$. Thus, $ar_2 = 15a - 15$. If $a \\neq 0$, then $r_2 = 15 - \\frac{15}{a}$.\nSince $r_2$ is an integer, $\\frac{15}{a}$ must be an integer. Thus, $a$ must be a divisor of 15. The divisors of 15 are $\\pm 1, \\pm 3, \\pm 5, \\pm 15$.\nIf $a = 1$, then $r_2 = 15 - \\frac{15}{1} = 15 - 15 = 0$. So $f(x) = x(x-0) = x^2$.\nIf $a = 3$, then $r_2 = 15 - \\frac{15}{3} = 15 - 5 = 10$. So $f(x) = 3x(x-10) = 3x^2 - 30x$.\nIf $a = 5$, then $r_2 = 15 - \\frac{15}{5} = 15 - 3 = 12$. So $f(x) = 5x(x-12) = 5x^2 - 60x$.\nIf $a = 15$, then $r_2 = 15 - \\frac{15}{15} = 15 - 1 = 14$. So $f(x) = 15x(x-14) = 15x^2 - 210x$.\nIf $a = -1$, then $r_2 = 15 - \\frac{15}{-1} = 15 + 15 = 30$. So $f(x) = -x(x-30) = -x^2 + 30x$.\nIf $a = -3$, then $r_2 = 15 - \\frac{15}{-3} = 15 + 5 = 20$. So $f(x) = -3x(x-20) = -3x^2 + 60x$.\nIf $a = -5$, then $r_2 = 15 - \\frac{15}{-5} = 15 + 3 = 18$. So $f(x) = -5x(x-18) = -5x^2 + 90x$.\nIf $a = -15$, then $r_2 = 15 - \\frac{15}{-15} = 15 + 1 = 16$. So $f(x) = -15x(x-16) = -15x^2 + 240x$.\nIf $a=0$, then $b=15$, so $f(x) = 15x$. But $f(15) = 15(15) = 225$, so $f(x) = 15x$ is a solution.\nThe possible values of $a$ are $\\pm 1, \\pm 3, \\pm 5, \\pm 15, 0$. Thus, there are 9 possible quadratic functions.\nHowever, we are given that the number of quadratic functions is 10.\nIf $r_1 = 0$, then $f(x) = ax(x-r_2) = ax^2 - ar_2x$. We have $b = 15-15a$, so $-ar_2 = 15-15a$. Thus $r_2 = \\frac{15a-15}{a} = 15 - \\frac{15}{a}$. Since $r_2$ is an integer, $a$ must be a divisor of 15. The divisors of 15 are $\\pm 1, \\pm 3, \\pm 5, \\pm 15$.\nIf $a=0$, then $f(x) = 15x$. This is a linear function, not a quadratic function.\nIf $a=1$, $r_2=0$, $f(x) = x^2$.\nIf $a=3$, $r_2=10$, $f(x) = 3x(x-10) = 3x^2 - 30x$.\nIf $a=5$, $r_2=12$, $f(x) = 5x(x-12) = 5x^2 - 60x$.\nIf $a=15$, $r_2=14$, $f(x) = 15x(x-14) = 15x^2 - 210x$.\nIf $a=-1$, $r_2=30$, $f(x) = -x(x-30) = -x^2 + 30x$.\nIf $a=-3$, $r_2=20$, $f(x) = -3x(x-20) = -3x^2 + 60x$.\nIf $a=-5$, $r_2=18$, $f(x) = -5x(x-18) = -5x^2 + 90x$.\nIf $a=-15$, $r_2=16$, $f(x) = -15x(x-16) = -15x^2 + 240x$.\nWe have 8 quadratic functions. If $f(x) = ax^2 + bx$ and $f(0) = 0$, $f(15) = 225$, then $225a + 15b = 225$, so $15a+b=15$, $b=15-15a$.\nIf $a=0$, $b=15$, $f(x) = 15x$.\nIf $a=1$, $b=0$, $f(x) = x^2$.\nIf $a=2$, $b=-15$, $f(x) = 2x^2 - 15x$.\nIf $a=3$, $b=-30$, $f(x) = 3x^2 - 30x$.\nIf $a=4$, $b=-45$, $f(x) = 4x^2 - 45x$.\nIf $a=5$, $b=-60$, $f(x) = 5x^2 - 60x$.\nIf $a=6$, $b=-75$, $f(x) = 6x^2 - 75x$.\nIf $a=7$, $b=-90$, $f(x) = 7x^2 - 90x$.\nIf $a=8$, $b=-105$, $f(x) = 8x^2 - 105x$.\nIf $a=9$, $b=-120$, $f(x) = 9x^2 - 120x$.\nIf $a=10$, $b=-135$, $f(x) = 10x^2 - 135x$.\nIf $a=11$, $b=-150$, $f(x) = 11x^2 - 150x$.\nIf $a=12$, $b=-165$, $f(x) = 12x^2 - 165x$.\nIf $a=13$, $b=-180$, $f(x) = 13x^2 - 180x$.\nIf $a=14$, $b=-195$, $f(x) = 14x^2 - 195x$.\nIf $a=15$, $b=-210$, $f(x) = 15x^2 - 210x$.\n\nFinal Answer: The final answer is $\\boxed{10}$"], "id": 2669, "generated_answers": ["10"], "gold_answer": "8", "is_correct": false, "answers_correctness": [false]}

The center of the top marble is also at distance $r$ from the centers of the four marbles on the table. Thus, the center of the top marble is at $(0,0,2r)$, and the centers of the four marbles on the table are at $(\\pm a, \\pm a, r)$, where $a^2+a^2 = (2r-r)^2 = r^2$, so $2a^2 = r^2$, $a = \\frac{r}{\\sqrt{2}}$. The center of the bubble is at $(0,0,h)$ for some $h$. Since the marbles are tangent to the bubble, the distance from the center of the bubble to the center of a marble is $R+r = 1+r$.\nFor the marble at $(a,a,r)$, we have $a^2+a^2+(h-r)^2 = (1+r)^2$, so $r^2+(h-r)^2 = (1+r)^2$.

{"question": "In ARMLopolis, every house number is a positive integer, and City Hall's address is 0. However, due to the curved nature of the cowpaths that eventually became the streets of ARMLopolis, the distance $d(n)$ between house $n$ and City Hall is not simply the value of $n$. Instead, if $n=3^{k} n^{\\prime}$, where $k \\geq 0$ is an integer and $n^{\\prime}$ is an integer not divisible by 3 , then $d(n)=3^{-k}$. For example, $d(18)=1 / 9$ and $d(17)=1$. Notice that even though no houses have negative numbers, $d(n)$ is well-defined for negative values of $n$. For example, $d(-33)=1 / 3$ because $-33=3^{1} \\cdot-11$. By definition, $d(0)=0$. Following the dictum \"location, location, location,\" this Power Question will refer to \"houses\" and \"house numbers\" interchangeably.\n\nCuriously, the arrangement of the houses is such that the distance from house $n$ to house $m$, written $d(m, n)$, is simply $d(m-n)$. For example, $d(3,4)=d(-1)=1$ because $-1=3^{0} \\cdot-1$. In particular, if $m=n$, then $d(m, n)=0$.\n\n\nThe neighborhood of a house $n$, written $\\mathcal{N}(n)$, is the set of all houses that are the same distance from City Hall as $n$.

Geometrically, it may be helpful to think of $\\mathcal{N}(n)$ as a circle centered at City Hall with radius $d(n)$.\n\n\nUnfortunately for new development, ARMLopolis is full: every nonnegative integer corresponds to (exactly one) house (or City Hall, in the case of 0). However, eighteen families arrive and are looking to move in. After much debate, the connotations of using negative house numbers are deemed unacceptable, and the city decides on an alternative plan. On July 17, Shewad Movers arrive and relocate every family from house $n$ to house $n+18$, for all positive $n$ (so that City Hall does not move).

{"question": "In ARMLopolis, every house number is a positive integer, and City Hall's address is 0. However, due to the curved nature of the cowpaths that eventually became the streets of ARMLopolis, the distance $d(n)$ between house $n$ and City Hall is not simply the value of $n$. Instead, if $n=3^{k} n^{\\prime}$, where $k \\geq 0$ is an integer and $n^{\\prime}$ is an integer not divisible by 3 , then $d(n)=3^{-k}$. For example, $d(18)=1 / 9$ and $d(17)=1$. Notice that even though no houses have negative numbers, $d(n)$ is well-defined for negative values of $n$. For example, $d(-33)=1 / 3$ because $-33=3^{1} \\cdot-11$. By definition, $d(0)=0$. Following the dictum \"location, location, location,\" this Power Question will refer to \"houses\" and \"house numbers\" interchangeably.\n\nCuriously, the arrangement of the houses is such that the distance from house $n$ to house $m$, written $d(m, n)$, is simply $d(m-n)$. For example, $d(3,4)=d(-1)=1$ because $-1=3^{0} \\cdot-1$. In particular, if $m=n$, then $d(m, n)=0$.\n\n\nThe neighborhood of a house $n$, written $\\mathcal{N}(n)$, is the set of all houses that are the same distance from City Hall as $n$. In symbols, $\\mathcal{N}(n)=\\{m \\mid d(m)=d(n)\\}$. Geometrically, it may be helpful to think of $\\mathcal{N}(n)$ as a circle centered at City Hall with radius $d(n)$.\n\nLater, ARMLopolis finally decides on a drastic expansion plan: now house numbers will be rational numbers. To define $d(p / q)$, with $p$ and $q$ integers such that $p q \\neq 0$, write $p / q=3^{k} p^{\\prime} / q^{\\prime}$, where neither $p^{\\prime}$ nor $q^{\\prime}$ is divisible by 3 and $k$ is an integer (not necessarily positive); then $d(p / q)=3^{-k}$.\nCompute $d(3 / 5), d(5 / 8)$, and $d(7 / 18)$.", "generated_responses": ["Let $n$ be a rational number.

Let $P$ be a point outside the circle such that the shortest distance from $P$ to the circle is 4. This means that the distance from $P$ to the center $O$ is $6+4=10$.\nLet $A$ and $B$ be points on the circle such that $\\overline{AB}$ is parallel to $\\overleftrightarrow{OP}$. Let $M$ be the midpoint of $\\overline{AB}$. Then $OM \\perp AB$. Since $AB$ is parallel to $OP$, $OM$ is perpendicular to $AB$.\nThe distance between $AB$ and $OP$ is 2. Let $N$ be the point on $OP$ such that $MN \\perp OP$. Then $MN=2$.\nSince $OM \\perp AB$, $M$ is the midpoint of $AB$. Also, $OA=OB=6$.\nIn $\\triangle OMA$, $OA^2 = OM^2 + AM^2$, so $6^2 = OM^2 + AM^2$, which means $36 = OM^2 + AM^2$.\nSince $MN \\perp OP$, we have $ON = OM - MN = OM - 2$.\nIn $\\triangle ONP$, $OP^2 = ON^2 + NP^2$, so $10^2 = (OM-2)^2 + NP^2$.\nAlso, $NP = AM$ since $AB$ is parallel to $OP$.\nSo $100 = (OM-2)^2 + AM^2 = OM^2 - 4OM + 4 + AM^2$.\nSince $36 = OM^2 + AM^2$, we have $AM^2 = 36 - OM^2$.\nSubstituting this into the equation above, we get $100 = OM^2 - 4OM + 4 + 36 - OM^2 = 40 - 4OM$.\nThus, $4OM = 40 - 100 = -60$, so $OM = -15$. This is impossible since $OM$ is a distance.\nInstead, we consider two cases:\nCase 1: $N$ lies on $OM$. Then $ON = OM - MN = OM - 2$.\n$OP^2 = ON^2 + NP^2$, so $10^2 = (OM-2)^2 + AM^2$.\n$100 = OM^2 - 4OM + 4 + AM^2$.\nSince $OM^2 + AM^2 = 36$, we have $100 = 36 - 4OM + 4$, so $4OM = 36 + 4 - 100 = -60$, which means $OM = -15$. This is impossible.\nCase 2: $N$ lies on the extension of $OM$. Then $ON = OM + MN = OM + 2$.\n$OP^2 = ON^2 + NP^2$, so $10^2 = (OM+2)^2 + AM^2$.\n$100 = OM^2 + 4OM + 4 + AM^2$.\nSince $OM^2 + AM^2 = 36$, we have $100 = 36 + 4OM + 4$, so $4OM = 100 - 40 = 60$, which means $OM = 15$.\nThen $AM^2 = 36 - OM^2 = 36 - 15^2 = 36 - 225 = -189$, which is impossible.\nLet $d$ be the distance between $AB$ and $OP$. Then $d=2$.\nLet $M$ be the midpoint of $AB$. Then $OM \\perp AB$. Since $AB \\parallel OP$, the distance from $O$ to $AB$ is $OM$.\nThe distance from $P$ to $AB$ is $d=2$.\nLet $\\theta$ be the angle between $OM$ and $OP$. Then $\\sin \\theta = \\frac{d}{OP} = \\frac{2}{10} = \\frac{1}{5}$.\nAlso, $OM = \\sqrt{OP^2 - d^2} = \\sqrt{10^2 - 2^2} = \\sqrt{100-4} = \\sqrt{96} = 4\\sqrt{6}$.\nSince $OM \\perp AB$, $AM = \\sqrt{OA^2 - OM^2} = \\sqrt{6^2 - (4\\sqrt{6})^2} = \\sqrt{36 - 96} = \\sqrt{-60}$, which is impossible.\nLet $d$ be the distance between $AB$ and $OP$. Then $d=2$.\nLet $M$ be the midpoint of $AB$. Then $OM \\perp AB$. Since $AB \\parallel OP$, the distance from $O$ to $AB$ is $OM$.\nLet $N$ be the projection of $P$ onto $AB$. Then $PN = d = 2$.\nAlso, $ON = \\sqrt{OP^2 - PN^2} = \\sqrt{10^2 - 2^2} = \\sqrt{96} = 4\\sqrt{6}$.\nSince $OM \\perp AB$, $OM = ON - MN$ or $OM = ON + MN$.\nIf $M$ lies between $O$ and $N$, then $OM = ON - MN = 4\\sqrt{6} - MN$.\nIf $M$ lies on the other side of $N$ from $O$, then $OM = ON + MN = 4\\sqrt{6} + MN$.\nSince $OM \\perp AB$, we have $AM = \\sqrt{OA^2 - OM^2} = \\sqrt{36 - OM^2}$.\n$PA^2 = (P-A)(P-A) = (P-O+OA)(P-O+OA) = (P-O)^2 + OA^2 + 2(P-O) \\cdot OA = OP^2 + OA^2 - 2(P-O) \\cdot OA$.\n$PA^2 + PB^2 = (P-A)(P-A) + (P-B)(P-B) = 2P^2 - 2P(A+B) + A^2 + B^2$.\nSince $A$ and $B$ are on the circle, $OA=OB=6$.\n$PA^2 + PB^2 = 2(PA^2 + PB^2)$.\n\nLet $O$ be the origin. Let $P = (0, 10)$. Then the shortest distance from $P$ to the circle is $10-6=4$.\nLet $AB$ be parallel to $OP$, so $AB$ is horizontal. Let $M = (x, y)$ be the midpoint of $AB$. Then $OM \\perp AB$.\nThe distance from $O$ to $AB$ is $|y|$. Since $AB$ is parallel to $OP$, $AB$ is horizontal, so $AB$ has equation $y=k$ for some $k$.\nThe distance from $O$ to $AB$ is $|k|$. Since $OM \\perp AB$, $OM = |k|$.\nThe distance from $P$ to $AB$ is $|10-k| = 2$. So $10-k = 2$ or $10-k = -2$.\nIf $10-k=2$, then $k=8$. If $10-k=-2$, then $k=12$.\nSince $OM = |k|$, we have $OM = 8$ or $OM = 12$.\nIf $OM=8$, then $AM = \\sqrt{6^2 - 8^2} = \\sqrt{36-64} = \\sqrt{-28}$, which is impossible.\nIf $OM=12$, then $AM = \\sqrt{6^2 - 12^2} = \\sqrt{36-144} = \\sqrt{-108}$, which is impossible.\nLet $P = (0, 4)$. Then $OP = 6$. This doesn't work.\n\nLet $P = (x_0, y_0)$. Then $x_0^2 + y_0^2 = 100$.\nLet $AB$ be $y = c$. Then the distance from $O$ to $AB$ is $|c|$. The distance from $P$ to $AB$ is $|y_0 - c| = 2$.\nSo $y_0 - c = 2$ or $y_0 - c = -2$. Thus $c = y_0 - 2$ or $c = y_0 + 2$.\nSince $OM \\perp AB$, $M$ is $(x_M, c)$. Then $OM = \\sqrt{x_M^2 + c^2} = 6$.\nAlso, $ON = |c|$. $MN = |y_0 - c| = 2$.\nIf $c = y_0 - 2$, then $OM = 6$, so $x_M^2 + (y_0-2)^2 = 36$.\nIf $c = y_0 + 2$, then $OM = 6$, so $x_M^2 + (y_0+2)^2 = 36$.\n$PA^2 = (x_M - x_0)^2 + (c - y_0)^2$.\n\nFinal Answer: The final answer is $\\boxed{124}$"], "id": 2710, "generated_answers": ["124"], "gold_answer": "272", "is_correct": false, "answers_correctness": [false]}

Then $g'(x) = 481-18x$.\n$g'(x)=0$ when $x = \\frac{481}{18} = 26.72$.\nSince $x$ is an integer, we consider $x=26$ and $x=27$.\nIf $x=26$, then $z=160-3(26)=160-78=82$.\nThen $x+yz = 26+26(82) = 26+2132 = 2158$.\nIf $x=27$, then $z=160-3(27)=160-81=79$.\nThen $x+yz = 27+27(79) = 27+2133 = 2160$.\nIf $x=1$, then $z=160-y$.\nThen $x+yz = 1+y(160-y) = 1+160y-y^2$.\nTo minimize $1+160y-y^2$, we want to maximize $y$.\nSince $z>0$, we have $160-y>0$, so $y<160$.\nLet $h(y) = 1+160y-y^2$. Then $h'(y) = 160-2y$.\n$h'(y)=0$ when $y=80$.\nIf $y=79$, then $z=160-79=81$.\nThen $x+yz = 1+79(81) = 1+6399 = 6400$.\nIf $y=80$, then $z=160-80=80$.\nThen $x+yz = 1+80(80) = 1+6400 = 6401$.\nIf $x=1, y=1$, then $z=160-1(1)=159$.\nThen $x+yz = 1+1(159) = 160$.\nIf $x=1, y=2$, then $z=160-1(2)=158$.\nThen $x+yz = 1+2(158) = 1+316 = 317$.\nIf $x=1, y=3$, then $z=160-1(3)=157$.\nThen $x+yz = 1+3(157) = 1+471 = 472$.\nIf $x=2, y=1$, then $z=160-2(1)=158$.\nThen $x+yz = 2+1(158) = 2+158 = 160$.\nIf $x=2, y=2$, then $z=160-2(2)=156$.\nThen $x+yz = 2+2(156) = 2+312 = 314$.\nIf $x=2, y=3$, then $z=160-2(3)=154$.\nThen $x+yz = 2+3(154) = 2+462 = 464$.\nIf $x=3, y=1$, then $z=160-3(1)=157$.\nThen $x+yz = 3+1(157) = 3+157 = 160$.\nIf $x=3, y=2$, then $z=160-3(2)=154$.\nThen $x+yz = 3+2(154) = 3+308 = 311$.\nIf $x=3, y=3$, then $z=160-3(3)=151$.\nThen $x+yz = 3+3(151) = 3+453 = 456$.\nIf $x=4, y=1$, then $z=160-4(1)=156$.\nThen $x+yz = 4+1(156) = 4+156 = 160$.\nIf $x=4, y=2$, then $z=160-4(2)=152$.\nThen $x+yz = 4+2(152) = 4+304 = 308$.\nIf $x=4, y=3$, then $z=160-4(3)=148$.\nThen $x+yz = 4+3(148) = 4+444 = 448$.\nIf $x=5, y=1$, then $z=160-5(1)=155$.\nThen $x+yz = 5+1(155) = 5+155 = 160$.\nIf $x=5, y=2$, then $z=160-5(2)=150$.\nThen $x+yz = 5+2(150) = 5+300 = 305$.\nIf $x=5, y=3$, then $z=160-5(3)=145$.\nThen $x+yz = 5+3(145) = 5+435 = 440$.\nIf $x=6, y=1$, then $z=160-6(1)=154$.\nThen $x+yz = 6+1(154) = 6+154 = 160$.\nIf $x=6, y=2$, then $z=160-6(2)=148$.\nThen $x+yz = 6+2(148) = 6+296 = 302$.\nIf $x=6, y=3$, then $z=160-6(3)=142$.\nThen $x+yz = 6+3(142) = 6+426 = 432$.\nIf $x=7, y=1$, then $z=160-7(1)=153$.\nThen $x+yz = 7+1(153) = 7+153 = 160$.\nIf $x=7, y=2$, then $z=160-7(2)=146$.\nThen $x+yz = 7+2(146) = 7+292 = 299$.\nIf $x=7, y=3$, then $z=160-7(3)=139$.\nThen $x+yz = 7+3(139) = 7+417 = 424$.\nIf $x=8, y=1$, then $z=160-8(1)=152$.\nThen $x+yz = 8+1(152) = 8+152 = 160$.\nIf $x=8, y=2$, then $z=160-8(2)=144$.\nThen $x+yz = 8+2(144) = 8+288 = 296$.\nIf $x=8, y=3$, then $z=160-8(3)=136$.\nThen $x+yz = 8+3(136) = 8+408 = 416$.\nIf $x=9, y=1$, then $z=160-9(1)=151$.\nThen $x+yz = 9+1(151) = 9+151 = 160$.\nIf $x=9, y=2$, then $z=160-9(2)=142$.\nThen $x+yz = 9+2(142) = 9+284 = 293$.\nIf $x=9, y=3$, then $z=160-9(3)=133$.\nThen $x+yz = 9+3(133) = 9+399 = 408$.\nIf $x=10, y=1$, then $z=160-10(1)=150$.\nThen $x+yz = 10+1(150) = 10+150 = 160$.\nIf $x=10, y=2$, then $z=160-10(2)=140$.\nThen $x+yz = 10+2(140) = 10+280 = 290$.\nIf $x=10, y=3$, then $z=160-10(3)=130$.\nThen $x+yz = 10+3(130) = 10+390 = 400$.\nIf $x=11, y=1$, then $z=160-11(1)=149$.\nThen $x+yz = 11+1(149) = 11+149 = 160$.\nIf $x=11, y=2$, then $z=160-11(2)=138$.\nThen $x+yz = 11+2(138) = 11+276 = 287$.\nIf $x=11, y=3$, then $z=160-11(3)=127$.\nThen $x+yz = 11+3(127) = 11+381 = 392$.\nIf $x=12, y=1$, then $z=160-12(1)=148$.\nThen $x+yz = 12+1(148) = 12+148 = 160$.\nIf $x=12, y=2$, then $z=160-12(2)=136$.\nThen $x+yz = 12+2(136) = 12+272 = 284$.\nIf $x=12, y=3$, then $z=160-12(3)=124$.\nThen $x+yz = 12+3(124) = 12+372 = 384$.\nIf $x=13, y=1$, then $z=160-13(1)=147$.\nThen $x+yz = 13+1(147) = 13+147 = 160$.\nIf $x=13, y=2$, then $z=160-13(2)=134$.\nThen $x+yz = 13+2(134) = 13+268 = 281$.\nIf $x=13, y=3$, then $z=160-13(3)=121$.\nThen $x+yz = 13+3(121) = 13+363 = 376$.\nIf $x=14, y=1$, then $z=160-14(1)=146$.\nThen $x+yz = 14+1(146) = 14+146 = 160$.\nIf $x=14, y=2$, then $z=160-14(2)=132$.\nThen $x+yz = 14+2(132) = 14+264 = 278$.\nIf $x=14, y=3$, then $z=160-14(3)=118$.\nThen $x+yz = 14+3(118) = 14+354 = 368$.\nIf $x=15, y=1$, then $z=160-15(1)=145$.\nThen $x+yz = 15+1(145) = 15+145 = 160$.\nIf $x=15, y=2$, then $z=160-15(2)=130$.\nThen $x+yz = 15+2(130) = 15+260 = 275$.\nIf $x=15, y=3$, then $z=160-15(3)=115$.\nThen $x+yz = 15+3(115) = 15+345 = 360$.\nIf $x=16, y=1$, then $z=160-16(1)=144$.\nThen $x+yz = 16+1(144) = 16+144 = 160$.\nIf $x=16, y=2$, then $z=160-16(2)=128$.\nThen $x+yz = 16+2(128) = 16+256 = 272$.\nIf $x=16, y=3$, then $z=160-16("], "id": 2712, "generated_answers": [""], "gold_answer": "50", "is_correct": false, "answers_correctness": [false]}

Let $4t - 3 = n$, where $n$ is an integer. Then $4t = n + 3$, so $t = \\frac{n+3}{4}$.\nThen $\\lfloor t^2 \\rfloor = \\lfloor \\left(\\frac{n+3}{4}\\right)^2 \\rfloor = \\lfloor \\frac{n^2 + 6n + 9}{16} \\rfloor = n$.\nThus, $n \\le \\frac{n^2 + 6n + 9}{16} < n+1$.\nMultiplying by 16, we have $16n \\le n^2 + 6n + 9 < 16n + 16$.\nThis gives us two inequalities:\n1) $16n \\le n^2 + 6n + 9$, which simplifies to $0 \\le n^2 - 10n + 9 = (n-1)(n-9)$. Thus, $n \\le 1$ or $n \\ge 9$.\n2) $n^2 + 6n + 9 < 16n + 16$, which simplifies to $n^2 - 10n - 7 < 0$.\nThe roots of $n^2 - 10n - 7 = 0$ are $n = \\frac{10 \\pm \\sqrt{100 - 4(-7)}}{2} = \\frac{10 \\pm \\sqrt{128 + 4}}{2} = \\frac{10 \\pm \\sqrt{132}}{2} = \\frac{10 \\pm 2\\sqrt{33}}{2} = 5 \\pm \\sqrt{33}$.\nSince $\\sqrt{33} \\approx 5.74$, we have $5 - \\sqrt{33} \\approx -0.74$ and $5 + \\sqrt{33} \\approx 10.74$.\nThus, we need $5 - \\sqrt{33} < n < 5 + \\sqrt{33}$, which means $-0.74 < n < 10.74$.\nSince $n$ is an integer, we have $n \\in \\{0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10\\}$.\nFrom the first inequality, we have $n \\le 1$ or $n \\ge 9$.\nCombining these, we have $n \\in \\{0, 1, 9, 10\\}$.\nIf $n = 0$, then $t = \\frac{0+3}{4} = \\frac{3}{4}$. Then $\\lfloor t^2 \\rfloor = \\lfloor \\left(\\frac{3}{4}\\right)^2 \\rfloor = \\lfloor \\frac{9}{16} \\rfloor = 0 = n$.\nIf $n = 1$, then $t = \\frac{1+3}{4} = 1$.

Since the angles are in arithmetic progression, we can write them as $a, a+d, a+2d, a+3d, a+4d, a+5d$, where $a$ is the first term and $d$ is the common difference. The sum of the interior angles of a convex $n$-sided polygon is $(n-2) \\times 180^\\circ$. For a hexagon, $n=6$, so the sum of the interior angles is $(6-2) \\times 180^\\circ = 4 \\times 180^\\circ = 720^\\circ$.\nThus, we have\n$$a + (a+d) + (a+2d) + (a+3d) + (a+4d) + (a+5d) = 720$$\n$$6a + 15d = 720$$\nDividing by 3, we get\n$$2a + 5d = 240$$\nSince the angles are integers, $a$ and $d$ must be integers.

Thus, we have $0 < a < 180$ and $0 < a+5d < 180$.\nFrom $2a + 5d = 240$, we have $2a = 240 - 5d$, so $a = 120 - \\frac{5}{2}d$. Since $a$ is an integer, $d$ must be an even integer.

Then $a = 120 - 5k$.\nThe angles are $120-5k, 120-5k+2k, 120-5k+4k, 120-5k+6k, 120-5k+8k, 120-5k+10k$, which are $120-5k, 120-3k, 120-k, 120+k, 120+3k, 120+5k$.\nSince the angles are integers, we need $k$ to be an integer. Also, we need $0 < 120-5k < 180$ and $0 < 120+5k < 180$.\nFrom $0 < 120-5k < 180$, we have $-180 < 5k < 120$, so $-36 < k < 24$.\nFrom $0 < 120+5k < 180$, we have $-120 < 5k < 60$, so $-24 < k < 12$.\nThus, we have $-35 < k < 12$. Since we want the smallest angle to be as small as possible, we want $k$ to be as large as possible. So we choose $k=11$. Then $a = 120 - 5(11) = 120 - 55 = 65$.

Since $BD$ is the trisector of $\\angle B$, we have $\\angle ABD = \\angle DBC = \\angle B/3$. By the Angle Bisector Theorem, we have $\\frac{AD}{CD} = \\frac{AB}{BC} = 1$, so $AD = CD = \\frac{y}{2}$.\nLet $\\angle B = 2\\theta$. Then $\\angle ABD = \\angle DBC = \\theta$. Since $AB = BC$, $\\triangle ABC$ is isosceles, so $\\angle BAC = \\angle BCA = \\frac{180^\\circ - 2\\theta}{2} = 90^\\circ - \\theta$.\nIn $\\triangle ABD$, we have $\\angle ADB = 180^\\circ - \\angle BAD - \\angle ABD = 180^\\circ - (90^\\circ - \\theta) - \\theta = 90^\\circ$.\nThus, $\\triangle ABD$ is a right triangle with $\\angle ADB = 90^\\circ$. By the Pythagorean theorem, we have $AB^2 = AD^2 + BD^2$, so $x^2 = (\\frac{y}{2})^2 + BD^2$. Thus, $BD^2 = x^2 - \\frac{y^2}{4}$.\nWe are given that $AB - BD = 7$, so $x - BD = 7$, which means $BD = x-7$.\nSubstituting this into the equation $BD^2 = x^2 - \\frac{y^2}{4}$, we get $(x-7)^2 = x^2 - \\frac{y^2}{4}$.\nExpanding, we have $x^2 - 14x + 49 = x^2 - \\frac{y^2}{4}$.\nThen $-14x + 49 = -\\frac{y^2}{4}$, so $14x - 49 = \\frac{y^2}{4}$.\nMultiplying by 4, we have $56x - 196 = y^2$.\nSince $x$ and $y$ are integers, we need to find integer solutions to $y^2 = 56x - 196$.\nSince $y^2 \\ge 0$, we have $56x - 196 \\ge 0$, so $56x \\ge 196$, which means $x \\ge \\frac{196}{56} = \\frac{49}{14} = 3.5$.\nSince $x$ is an integer, we must have $x \\ge 4$.\nAlso, $x-7 > 0$, so $x > 7$.\nWe want $56x - 196$ to be a perfect square.\nLet $56x - 196 = k^2$ for some integer $k$.

Let $k = 2n$ for some integer $n$. Then $56x - 196 = 4n^2$, so $14x - 49 = n^2$.\nThen $14x = n^2 + 49$, so $n^2 + 49$ must be divisible by 14.\nSince $n^2 + 49 \\equiv n^2 + 0 \\equiv n^2 \\pmod{2}$, $n^2$ must be even, so $n$ is even. Let $n = 2m$.\nThen $n^2 = 4m^2$, so $14x = 4m^2 + 49$. Then $4m^2 + 49$ must be divisible by 14.\n$4m^2 + 49 \\equiv 4m^2 + 7 \\pmod{14}$. We need $4m^2 + 7 \\equiv 0 \\pmod{14}$, so $4m^2 \\equiv -7 \\equiv 7 \\pmod{14}$.\nDividing by 2, we have $2m^2 \\equiv \\frac{7}{2} \\pmod{7}$, which is not possible.\nInstead, we can try values of $x$ such that $x > 7$ and $x$ is an integer.\nIf $x = 8$, then $y^2 = 56(8) - 196 = 448 - 196 = 252$, which is not a perfect square.\nIf $x = 9$, then $y^2 = 56(9) - 196 = 504 - 196 = 308$, which is not a perfect square.\nIf $x = 10$, then $y^2 = 56(10) - 196 = 560 - 196 = 364$, which is not a perfect square.\nIf $x = 11$, then $y^2 = 56(11) - 196 = 616 - 196 = 420$, which is not a perfect square.\nIf $x = 12$, then $y^2 = 56(12) - 196 = 672 - 196 = 476$, which is not a perfect square.\nIf $x = 13$, then $y^2 = 56(13) - 196 = 728 - 196 = 532$, which is not a perfect square.\nIf $x = 14$, then $y^2 = 56(14) - 196 = 784 - 196 = 588$, which is not a perfect square.\nIf $x = 15$, then $y^2 = 56(15) - 196 = 840 - 196 = 644$, which is not a perfect square.\nIf $x = 16$, then $y^2 = 56(16) - 196 = 896 - 196 = 700$, which is not a perfect square.\nIf $x = 17$, then $y^2 = 56(17) - 196 = 952 - 196 = 756$, which is not a perfect square.\nIf $x = 18$, then $y^2 = 56(18) - 196 = 1008 - 196 = 812$, which is not a perfect square.\nIf $x = 19$, then $y^2 = 56(19) - 196 = 1064 - 196 = 868$, which is not a perfect square.\nIf $x = 20$, then $y^2 = 56(20) - 196 = 1120 - 196 = 924$, which is not a perfect square.\nIf $x = 21$, then $y^2 = 56(21) - 196 = 1176 - 196 = 980 = 140 \\cdot 7$, which is not a perfect square.\nIf $x = 22$, then $y^2 = 56(22) - 196 = 1232 - 196 = 1036$, which is not a perfect square.\nIf $x = 23$, then $y^2 = 56(23) - 196 = 1288 - 196 = 1092$, which is not a perfect square.\nIf $x = 24$, then $y^2 = 56(24) - 196 = 1344 - 196 = 1148$, which is not a perfect square.\nIf $x = 25$, then $y^2 = 56(25) - 196 = 1400 - 196 = 1204$, which is not a perfect square.\nIf $x = 26$, then $y^2 = 56(26) - 196 = 1456 - 196 = 1260$, which is not a perfect square.\nIf $x = 27$, then $y^2 = 56(27) - 196 = 1512 - 196 = 1316$, which is not a perfect square.\nIf $x = 28$, then $y^2 = 56(28) - 196 = 1568 - 196 = 1372 = 4 \\cdot 343 = 4 \\cdot 7^3$, which is not a perfect square.\nIf $x = 29$, then $y^2 = 56(29) - 196 = 1624 - 196 = 1428$, which is not a perfect square.\nIf $x = 30$, then $y^2 = 56(30) - 196 = 1680 - 196 = 1484$, which is not a perfect square.\nIf $x = 31$, then $y^2 = 56(31) - 196 = 1736 - 196 = 1540$, which is not a perfect square.\nIf $x = 32$, then $y^2 = 56(32) - 196 = 1792 - 196 = 1596$, which is not a perfect square.\nIf $x = 33$, then $y^2 = 56(33) - 196 = 1848 - 196 = 1652$, which is not a perfect square.\nIf $x = 34$, then $y^2 = 56(34) - 196 = 1904 - 196 = 1708$, which is not a perfect square.\nIf $x = 35$, then $y^2 = 56(35) - 196 = 1960 - 196 = 1764 = 42^2$.

{"question": "An $\\boldsymbol{n}$-label is a permutation of the numbers 1 through $n$. For example, $J=35214$ is a 5 -label and $K=132$ is a 3 -label. For a fixed positive integer $p$, where $p \\leq n$, consider consecutive blocks of $p$ numbers in an $n$-label. For example, when $p=3$ and $L=263415$, the blocks are 263,634,341, and 415. We can associate to each of these blocks a $p$-label that corresponds to the relative order of the numbers in that block. For $L=263415$, we get the following:\n\n$$\n\\underline{263} 415 \\rightarrow 132 ; \\quad 2 \\underline{63415} \\rightarrow 312 ; \\quad 26 \\underline{341} 5 \\rightarrow 231 ; \\quad 263 \\underline{415} \\rightarrow 213\n$$\n\nMoving from left to right in the $n$-label, there are $n-p+1$ such blocks, which means we obtain an $(n-p+1)$-tuple of $p$-labels. For $L=263415$, we get the 4 -tuple $(132,312,231,213)$. We will call this $(n-p+1)$-tuple the $\\boldsymbol{p}$-signature of $L$ (or signature, if $p$ is clear from the context) and denote it by $S_{p}[L]$; the $p$-labels in the signature are called windows.

A signature that occurs for exactly one $n$-label is called unique, and a signature that doesn't occur for any $n$-labels is called impossible.

Then $A_2 = e^{i\\pi/4}$, $A_3 = e^{2i\\pi/4} = i$, $A_4 = e^{3i\\pi/4}$, $A_5 = e^{4i\\pi/4} = -1$, $A_6 = e^{5i\\pi/4} = -e^{i\\pi/4}$, $A_7 = e^{6i\\pi/4} = -i$, $A_8 = e^{7i\\pi/4} = e^{-i\\pi/4}$.\nThen $\\mathbf{u} = A_2 - A_1 = e^{i\\pi/4} - 1$ and $\\mathbf{v} = A_8 - A_1 = e^{-i\\pi/4} - 1$.\nAlso, $A_4 - A_1 = e^{3i\\pi/4} - 1$.\nWe want to find $a$ and $b$ such that $e^{3i\\pi/4} - 1 = a(e^{i\\pi/4} - 1) + b(e^{-i\\pi/4} - 1)$.\n$e^{3i\\pi/4} - 1 = a e^{i\\pi/4} - a + b e^{-i\\pi/4} - b$.\n$e^{3i\\pi/4} - 1 = a e^{i\\pi/4} + b e^{-i\\pi/4} - (a+b)$.\nWe have $e^{3i\\pi/4} = \\cos(3\\pi/4) + i \\sin(3\\pi/4) = -\\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2} + i \\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2}$.\n$e^{i\\pi/4} = \\cos(\\pi/4) + i \\sin(\\pi/4) = \\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2} + i \\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2}$.\n$e^{-i\\pi/4} = \\cos(-\\pi/4) + i \\sin(-\\pi/4) = \\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2} - i \\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2}$.\nThus, $-\\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2} + i \\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2} - 1 = a(\\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2} + i \\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2}) + b(\\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2} - i \\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2}) - (a+b)$.\n$-\\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2} - 1 + i \\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2} = (\\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2} + \\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2})a + (\\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2} - \\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2})b - (a+b)$.\n$-\\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2} - 1 + i \\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2} = \\sqrt{2} a - (a+b)$.\nEquating real and imaginary parts, we have\n$-\\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2} - 1 = \\sqrt{2} a - a - b$ and $\\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2} = 0$.\nThis is not possible.\n\nLet $O$ be the center of the octagon. Then $\\angle A_1 A_2 A_3 = 135^\\circ$.\nAlso, $\\angle A_1 A_2 A_8 = 45^\\circ$.\nWe have $\\overrightarrow{A_1 A_4} = \\overrightarrow{A_1 A_2} + \\overrightarrow{A_2 A_3} + \\overrightarrow{A_3 A_4} = \\mathbf{u} + \\mathbf{u} + \\mathbf{u} = 3 \\mathbf{u}$.\nHowever, this is not correct.\nWe have $\\overrightarrow{A_1 A_4} = \\overrightarrow{A_1 A_2} + \\overrightarrow{A_2 A_3} + \\overrightarrow{A_3 A_4} = \\mathbf{u} + \\mathbf{u} + \\mathbf{u} = 3 \\mathbf{u}$.\nAlso, $\\overrightarrow{A_1 A_8} = \\overrightarrow{A_1 A_2} + \\overrightarrow{A_2 A_3} + \\overrightarrow{A_3 A_4} + \\overrightarrow{A_4 A_5} + \\overrightarrow{A_5 A_6} + \\overrightarrow{A_6 A_7} + \\overrightarrow{A_7 A_8} = \\mathbf{u} + \\mathbf{u} + \\mathbf{u} + \\mathbf{u} + \\mathbf{u} + \\mathbf{u} + \\mathbf{u} = 7 \\mathbf{u}$.\nThis is also not correct.\nLet $s$ be the side length of the octagon.

The smallest prime number greater than or equal to 999,999 is 1,000,003. Thus, $n = 1,000,003$.\n\nCase 2: $n$ is a product of two distinct primes, say $n = pq$. Then $n^n = (pq)^{pq} = p^{pq} q^{pq}$, and $d(n^n) = (pq+1)(pq+1) = (pq+1)^2$. We want $(pq+1)^2 \\ge 1,000,000$, so $pq+1 \\ge 1000$, which means $pq \\ge 999$. We want to minimize $n = pq$ such that $pq \\ge 999$. We can take $p=2$ and $q=499$, so $n=998$. Then $d(n^n) = (2n+1)(n+1) = (1997)(999) = 1995003 < 1,000,000$.\nIf $n=999$, then $n = 3^2 \\cdot 37$. Then $n^n = 3^{2n} \\cdot 37^n$, so $d(n^n) = (2n+1)(n+1) = (1999)(1000) = 1,999,000 > 1,000,000$. Thus, $n=999$ works.\n\nCase 3: $n$ is a power of a prime, say $n = p^k$. Then $n^n = (p^k)^{p^k} = p^{kp^k}$, and $d(n^n) = kp^k + 1$. We want $kp^k + 1 \\ge 1,000,000$.\nIf $k=1$, then $n=p$, and we have $p+1 \\ge 1,000,000$, so $p \\ge 999,999$. Then $n=1,000,003$.\nIf $k=2$, then $n=p^2$, and we have $2p^2 + 1 \\ge 1,000,000$, so $2p^2 \\ge 999,999$, $p^2 \\ge 499,999.5$, $p \\ge \\sqrt{499,999.5} \\approx 707.1$. Then $n = 709^2 = 502681$. Then $d(n^n) = 2(709^2) + 1 = 2(502681) + 1 = 1005363 > 1,000,000$.\n\nWe want to find the smallest $n$ such that $d(n^n) \\ge 1,000,000$.\nIf $n=999$, then $n^n = 999^{999} = (3^2 \\cdot 37)^{999} = 3^{1998} \\cdot 37^{999}$. Then $d(n^n) = (1998+1)(999+1) = 1999 \\cdot 1000 = 1,999,000 \\ge 1,000,000$.\nIf $n=998$, then $n^n = 998^{998} = (2 \\cdot 499)^{998} = 2^{998} \\cdot 499^{998}$. Then $d(n^n) = (998+1)(998+1) = 999^2 = 998001 < 1,000,000$.\n\nThus, the smallest positive integer $n$ such that $n^n$ has at least 1,000,000 positive divisors is 999.\n\nFinal Answer: The final answer is $\\boxed{999}$"], "id": 2954, "generated_answers": ["999"], "gold_answer": "84", "is_correct": false, "answers_correctness": [false]}

Then $N = N_1 + N_2 + N_3$.\nWe want to find $N_1 - N_2 - N_3$.\nSince $i^d$ is periodic with period 4, we have $i^d = i^{d \\pmod{4}}$.\nWe have $f(2T+1) = \\sum_{d \\mid 2T+1} i^d$.\nLet $2T+1 = p_1^{a_1} p_2^{a_2} \\dots p_k^{a_k}$ be the prime factorization of $2T+1$.\nThen the divisors of $2T+1$ are of the form $p_1^{b_1} p_2^{b_2} \\dots p_k^{b_k}$ where $0 \\le b_i \\le a_i$ for all $i$.\nWe want to find the number of divisors $d$ such that $d \\equiv 1 \\pmod{4}$, $d \\equiv 2 \\pmod{4}$, and $d \\equiv 3 \\pmod{4}$.\nIf $p_i \\equiv 1 \\pmod{4}$, then $p_i^{b_i} \\equiv 1 \\pmod{4}$ for any $b_i$.\nIf $p_i \\equiv 3 \\pmod{4}$, then $p_i^{b_i} \\equiv 1 \\pmod{4}$ if $b_i$ is even, and $p_i^{b_i} \\equiv 3 \\pmod{4}$ if $b_i$ is odd.\nIf $p_i \\equiv 2 \\pmod{4}$, then $p_i = 2$, which is not possible since $2T+1$ is odd.\nLet $N_1$ be the number of divisors congruent to $1 \\pmod{4}$, $N_2$ be the number of divisors congruent to $2 \\pmod{4}$, and $N_3$ be the number of divisors congruent to $3 \\pmod{4}$.\nThen $f(2T+1) = N_1 i - N_2 - N_3 i$.\nWe want to find $N_1 - N_3$.\nIf $2T+1 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{4}$, then $2T \\equiv 0 \\pmod{4}$, so $T$ is even.\nIf $2T+1 \\equiv 3 \\pmod{4}$, then $2T \\equiv 2 \\pmod{4}$, so $T$ is odd.\nIf $2T+1 = 1$, then $T=0$.

We are given that $a+b+c = 2019$, $AD = 229$, and $AC$ and $AD$ are relatively prime, i.e., $\\gcd(b, 229) = 1$. Since $AD = 229$, we have $AB = c = AD + BD = 229 + BD$.\nBy the Angle Bisector Theorem, we have $\\frac{AD}{BD} = \\frac{AC}{BC}$, so $\\frac{229}{BD} = \\frac{b}{a}$. Thus, $229a = bBD$. Since $BD = c - AD = c - 229$, we have $229a = b(c-229)$.\nWe have $a+b+c = 2019$, so $c = 2019 - a - b$. Substituting this into the equation $229a = b(c-229)$, we get\n$229a = b(2019 - a - b - 229) = b(1790 - a - b)$.\nThus, $229a = 1790b - ab - b^2$, which gives $229a + ab + b^2 = 1790b$. Rearranging, we have $a(229+b) = 1790b - b^2$, so $a = \\frac{1790b - b^2}{229+b}$.\nSince $a$ is an integer, we must have $229+b$ divides $1790b - b^2$. Also, $a > 0$, so $1790b - b^2 > 0$, which means $b < 1790$.\nWe have $a = \\frac{1790b - b^2}{229+b} = \\frac{1790b + 1790(229) - 1790(229) - b^2}{229+b} = \\frac{1790(229) + b(1790-b)}{229+b} = \\frac{1790(229)}{229+b} + \\frac{b(1790-b)}{229+b}$.\nSince $a$ is an integer, we must have $229+b$ divides $1790(229)$. Also, $229+b$ divides $b(1790-b)$.\nSince $229+b$ divides $1790(229)$, we can write $1790(229) = k(229+b)$ for some integer $k$. Then $1790(229) = 229k + kb$, so $kb = 1790(229) - 229k = 229(1790-k)$. Thus, $b = \\frac{229(1790-k)}{k}$.\nSince $b$ is an integer, $k$ must divide $229(1790-k)$. Since $229$ is prime, $k$ must divide $229$ or $1790-k$. If $k$ divides $229$, then $k=1$ or $k=229$.\nIf $k=1$, then $b = 229(1790-1) = 229(1789) = 410041$. But $a+b+c = 2019$, so $b < 2019$, which is a contradiction.\nIf $k=229$, then $b = \\frac{229(1790-229)}{229} = 1790-229 = 1561$.\nThen $a = \\frac{1790(1561) - 1561^2}{229+1561} = \\frac{1561(1790-1561)}{1790} = \\frac{1561(229)}{1790} = \\frac{1561}{10} \\cdot \\frac{229}{179}$, which is not an integer.\nThus, we must have $229+b$ divides $b(1790-b)$. Since $229+b$ divides $b(1790-b)$, we can write $b(1790-b) = k(229+b)$ for some integer $k$.\nThen $1790b - b^2 = k(229+b)$, so $1790b - b^2 = 229k + kb$. Thus, $b(1790-b-k) = 229k$.\nSince $229$ is prime, we must have $b=1$ or $b=229$ or $b=229k$ or $b=1$.\nIf $b=1$, then $a = \\frac{1790 - 1}{229+1} = \\frac{1789}{230}$, which is not an integer.\nIf $b=229$, then $a = \\frac{1790(229) - 229^2}{229+229} = \\frac{229(1790-229)}{2(229)} = \\frac{1790-229}{2} = \\frac{1561}{2}$, which is not an integer.\nIf $b=229k$, then $229k(1790-b-k) = 229k$, so $1790-b-k = 1$, which means $b+k = 1789$. Since $b=229k$, we have $229k+k = 1789$, so $230k = 1789$, which means $k = \\frac{1789}{230}$, which is not an integer.\nWe have $a+b+c = 2019$ and $c = a+b-AD = a+b-229$. Then $a+b+a+b-229 = 2019$, so $2a+2b = 2248$, which means $a+b = 1124$.\nAlso, $a = \\frac{1790b-b^2}{229+b}$. Since $a+b=1124$, we have $a = 1124-b$. Then $1124-b = \\frac{1790b-b^2}{229+b}$.\n$(1124-b)(229+b) = 1790b-b^2$. Then $1124(229)+1124b-229b-b^2 = 1790b-b^2$.\n$256096+895b = 1790b$.

This is impossible since $a, b, c, d$ are non-negative integers.\nIf $d+9 \\ge 10$, then $d+9 = 10+k$ for some digit $k$.
