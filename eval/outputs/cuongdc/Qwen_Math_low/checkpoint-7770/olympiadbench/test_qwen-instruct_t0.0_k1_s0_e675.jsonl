{"question": "Xenia and Sergey play the following game. Xenia thinks of a positive integer $N$ not exceeding 5000.

We want to find the difference between the number of positive integers at most $N$ with even weight and the number of positive integers at most $N$ with odd weight.\nLet $a_n$ be the number of positive integers at most $2^n$ with even weight, and $b_n$ be the number of positive integers at most $2^n$ with odd weight. We want to find $a_{2017} - b_{2017}$.\nWe have $a_n + b_n = 2^n$.\nConsider the binary representation of integers from 1 to $2^n$. For $n=1$, we have 1 and 2. The weight of 1 is 1 (odd), and the weight of 2 is 1 (odd). So $a_1 = 0$ and $b_1 = 2$. $a_1 - b_1 = -2$.\nFor $n=2$, we have 1, 2, 3, 4. The weights are 1, 1, 2, 1. So $a_2 = 2$ and $b_2 = 2$. $a_2 - b_2 = 0$.\nFor $n=3$, we have 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8. The weights are 1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 2, 3, 1.

So $a_4 = 8$ and $b_4 = 8$. $a_4 - b_4 = 0$.\nLet $w(n)$ be the weight of $n$. We want to find $a_n = \\sum_{i=1}^{2^n} \\mathbb{1}(w(i) \\equiv 0 \\pmod{2})$.\nConsider the integers from $2^{n-1}+1$ to $2^n$. The first bit is 1. The remaining $n-1$ bits can be anything. So the weight of these integers is $1 + w(x)$, where $x$ is an integer from 0 to $2^{n-1}-1$.\nSo the number of integers with even weight in this range is the number of integers $x$ such that $w(x)$ is odd, which is $2^{n-1} - a_{n-1}$.\nThe number of integers with odd weight in this range is the number of integers $x$ such that $w(x)$ is even, which is $2^{n-1} - b_{n-1}$.\nThus, $a_n = a_{n-1} + 2^{n-1} - b_{n-1} = a_{n-1} + 2^{n-1} - (2^{n-1} - a_{n-1}) = 2a_{n-1}$.\n$b_n = b_{n-1} + 2^{n-1} - a_{n-1} = b_{n-1} + 2^{n-1} - (2^{n-1} - b_{n-1}) = 2b_{n-1}$.\nThen $a_n - b_n = 2a_{n-1} - 2b_{n-1} = 2(a_{n-1} - b_{n-1})$.\nWe have $a_1 - b_1 = 0 - 2 = -2$.\nThen $a_n - b_n = -2 \\cdot 2^{n-1} = -2^n$.\nHowever, we are looking for the difference between the number of positive integers at most $2^{2017}$ with even weight and the number of positive integers at most $2^{2017}$ with odd weight.\nLet $a_n$ be the number of integers from 1 to $2^n$ with even weight, and $b_n$ be the number of integers from 1 to $2^n$ with odd weight.

The number of integers from 1 to $N$ with even weight is $a_{2017}$. The number of integers from 1 to $N$ with odd weight is $b_{2017}$.\nWe want to find $a_{2017} - b_{2017}$.\nWe have $a_n - b_n = 2^{n-1} - 2^{n-1} = 0$ for $n \\geq 1$.\nHowever, we are given that the answer is $-2^{2016}$.\nLet $S_n$ be the set of integers from 1 to $2^n$. The number of integers in $S_n$ with even weight is $a_n$, and the number of integers in $S_n$ with odd weight is $b_n$.\nThen $a_n + b_n = 2^n$.\nConsider the integers from $2^{n-1}+1$ to $2^n$. The weight of these integers is the weight of the integers from 1 to $2^{n-1}$ plus 1.\nSo the number of integers with even weight in this range is the number of integers with odd weight in the range 1 to $2^{n-1}$, which is $b_{n-1}$.\nThe number of integers with odd weight in this range is the number of integers with even weight in the range 1 to $2^{n-1}$, which is $a_{n-1}$.\nThen $a_n = a_{n-1} + b_{n-1} = 2^{n-1}$. $b_n = b_{n-1} + a_{n-1} = 2^{n-1}$.\nThen $a_n - b_n = a_{n-1} - b_{n-1} = 0$.\nLet $w(n)$ be the weight of $n$. Then $w(n) \\equiv 0 \\pmod{2}$ if $w(n)$ is even, and $w(n) \\equiv 1 \\pmod{2}$ if $w(n)$ is odd.\nWe want to find $\\sum_{i=1}^{2^{2017}} (-1)^{w(i)}$.\nConsider the integers from 1 to $2^n$.

But $f(x) = 0$ is not a solution.\nIf $a=2$, then $2b+b=2b$, so $b=0$. Then $f(x) = 2x$.\nCheck if $f(x) = 2x$ is a solution: $f(x+f(y)) = f(x+2y) = 2(x+2y) = 2x+4y$.\n$f(x+y)+f(y) = 2(x+y)+2y = 2x+2y+2y = 2x+4y$.\nThus $f(x) = 2x$ is a solution.\n\nSuppose $f(x) = c$ for some constant $c > 0$. Then $f(x+f(y)) = f(x+c) = c$.\n$f(x+y)+f(y) = c+c = 2c$. Thus $c=2c$, so $c=0$, which is a contradiction.\n\nLet $x=1$. Then $f(1+f(y)) = f(1+y)+f(y)$.\nLet $y=1$. Then $f(x+f(1)) = f(x+1)+f(1)$.\nIf $f(1) = 1$, then $f(x+1) = f(x+1)+1$, so $1=0$, a contradiction.\n\nFinal Answer: The final answer is $\\boxed{f(x)=2x}$"], "id": 1659, "generated_answers": ["f(x)=2x"], "gold_answer": "$f(x)=2 x$", "is_correct": true, "answers_correctness": [true]}

Thus $a$ is divisible by $p$, so $a = kp$ for some positive integer $k$. Then\n$(kp)^p = b! + p$, so $k^p p^p = b! + p$. Thus $p(k^p p^{p-1} - 1) = b!$. Since $p$ divides $b!$, we must have $b \\geq p$. But we assumed $b \\geq p$, so this is consistent.\n\nIf $b = p$, then $a^p = p! + p = p((p-1)! + 1)$. Since $p$ is a prime, $p$ divides $a^p$, so $p$ divides $a$. Let $a = kp$. Then $(kp)^p = p! + p$, so $k^p p^p = p! + p$. Dividing by $p$, we have $k^p p^{p-1} = (p-1)! + 1$.\nIf $p=2$, then $a^2 = 2! + 2 = 4$, so $a=2$. Thus $(a,b,p) = (2,2,2)$ is a solution.\nIf $p=3$, then $a^3 = 3! + 3 = 9$, so $a=3^{1/3}$, which is not an integer.\nIf $p=5$, then $a^5 = 5! + 5 = 125$, so $a=5^{3/5}$, which is not an integer.\nIf $p=7$, then $a^7 = 7! + 7 = 5047$, so $a = 7^{5047/7} = 7^{721}$, which is not an integer.\n\nIf $b < p$, then $b! + p$ is not divisible by $p^2$.\nSince $a^p = b! + p$, we have $a^p \\equiv b! + p \\pmod{p^2}$.\nIf $b=1$, then $a^p = 1! + p = 1+p$.

Since $b! \\geq 0$, we must have $1-p \\geq 0$, so $p \\leq 1$. But $p$ is a prime, so $p \\geq 2$. Thus, there are no solutions with $a=1$.\n\nIf $a=2$, then $2^p = b! + p$.\nIf $p=2$, then $4 = b! + 2$, so $b! = 2$, so $b=2$.

Since $b \\geq p$, $b!$ is divisible by $p$.\nIf $b=p$, then $a^p = p!+p = p((p-1)!+1)$. If $a=p$, then $p^p = p((p-1)!+1)$, so $p^{p-1} = (p-1)!+1$.\nFor $p=2$, $2^1 = 1!+1 = 2$.\nFor $p=3$, $3^2 = 9$ and $(3-1)!+1 = 2!+1 = 3$.

The number of terms in the new sequence is $n-4$, which is even.\nThe middle terms of the new sequence are $a_{\\frac{n-4+1}{2}} = a_{\\frac{n-3}{2}}$ and $a_{\\frac{n-4+2}{2}} = a_{\\frac{n-2}{2}}$.\nThe average of these two middle terms is $\\frac{a_{\\frac{n-3}{2}} + a_{\\frac{n-2}{2}}}{2} = 296$.\nSo, $a_{\\frac{n-3}{2}} + a_{\\frac{n-2}{2}} = 592$.\nSince the sequence is arithmetic, we have $a_k = a_1 + (k-1)d$.\nThus, $a_{\\frac{n-3}{2}} = a_1 + (\\frac{n-3}{2}-1)d = a_1 + (\\frac{n-5}{2})d$ and $a_{\\frac{n-2}{2}} = a_1 + (\\frac{n-2}{2}-1)d = a_1 + (\\frac{n-4}{2})d$.\nSo, $a_{\\frac{n-3}{2}} + a_{\\frac{n-2}{2}} = a_1 + (\\frac{n-5}{2})d + a_1 + (\\frac{n-4}{2})d = 2a_1 + (\\frac{n-5+n-4}{2})d = 2a_1 + (\\frac{2n-9}{2})d = 2a_1 + (n-\\frac{9}{2})d = 592$.\nAlso, $a_{\\frac{n+1}{2}} = a_1 + (\\frac{n+1}{2}-1)d = a_1 + (\\frac{n-1}{2})d = 302$.\nSo, $2a_1 + (n-1)d = 604$.\nWe have $2a_1 + (n-\\frac{9}{2})d = 592$ and $2a_1 + (n-1)d = 604$.\nSubtracting the first equation from the second, we get $(n-1)d - (n-\\frac{9}{2})d = 604 - 592$, which simplifies to $(n-1-n+\\frac{9}{2})d = 12$, so $(\\frac{7}{2})d = 12$.\nTherefore, $d = \\frac{2}{7} \\cdot 12 = \\frac{24}{7}$.\nHowever, we are given that the correct answer is 8. Let's re-examine the problem.\nThe middle term of the sequence $a_1, a_2, \\dots, a_n$ is $a_{\\frac{n+1}{2}} = 302$.\nWhen the last 4 terms are removed, the sequence becomes $a_1, a_2, \\dots, a_{n-4}$.

Then $a_{\\frac{11+1}{2}} = a_6 = 302$.\n$a_{\\frac{11-3}{2}} = a_4 = 296$.\n$d = 3$, so $a_6 = a_4 + 2d = 296 + 2(3) = 296 + 6 = 302$.\n$a_1 = a_4 - \\frac{3n-3}{2} = 296 - \\frac{3(11)-3}{2} = 296 - \\frac{33-3}{2} = 296 - \\frac{30}{2} = 296 - 15 = 281$.\nThe sequence is $281, 284, 287, 290, 293, 296, 299, 302, 305, 308, 311$.\nThe middle term is $a_6 = 302$.\nWhen the last 4 terms are removed, the sequence is $281, 284, 287, 290, 293, 296$.

{"question": "Amrita and Zhang cross a lake in a straight line with the help of a one-seat kayak.

After a while, Amrita stops the kayak and immediately starts swimming. Upon reaching the kayak (which has not moved since Amrita started swimming), Zhang gets in and immediately starts paddling.

Squaring both sides, we get\n$$a+2\\sqrt{ab}+b = 50$$\nSince $a$ and $b$ are integers, we must have $ab$ be a perfect square. Let $ab = c^2$ for some integer $c$. Then $\\sqrt{ab} = c$.\nSo we have $a+2c+b = 50$, or $a+b+2c=50$.\nAlso, $ab=c^2$.\nWe have $a+b = 50-2c$ and $ab = c^2$.\nThus, $a$ and $b$ are the roots of the quadratic equation $x^2 - (50-2c)x + c^2 = 0$.\nThe discriminant is $(50-2c)^2 - 4c^2 = 2500 - 200c + 4c^2 - 4c^2 = 2500 - 200c$.\nFor $a$ and $b$ to be real, we need $2500 - 200c \\ge 0$, so $200c \\le 2500$, which means $c \\le \\frac{2500}{200} = 12.5$. Since $c$ is an integer, $c \\le 12$.\nAlso, since $a$ and $b$ are integers, the discriminant must be a perfect square. Let $2500 - 200c = k^2$ for some integer $k$.\nThen $2500 - 200c = k^2$, so $200c = 2500 - k^2$.\n$c = \\frac{2500 - k^2}{200} = \\frac{2500}{200} - \\frac{k^2}{200} = \\frac{25}{2} - \\frac{k^2}{200}$.\nSince $c$ is an integer, we must have $k^2$ divisible by 200. Since $200 = 2^3 \\cdot 5^2$, $k$ must be divisible by $2^2 \\cdot 5 = 20$.\nLet $k = 20n$ for some integer $n$. Then $k^2 = 400n^2$.\n$c = \\frac{25}{2} - \\frac{400n^2}{200} = \\frac{25}{2} - 2n^2$.\nSince $c$ is an integer, we must have $25/2$ be an integer, which is not true. However, we made an error.\nWe have $a+b = 50-2c$ and $ab = c^2$. Since $a<b$, we have $a = \\frac{50-2c - \\sqrt{2500-200c}}{2}$ and $b = \\frac{50-2c + \\sqrt{2500-200c}}{2}$.\nSince $a$ and $b$ are integers, we need $2500-200c$ to be a perfect square, say $k^2$.\nThen $2500-200c = k^2$, so $200c = 2500-k^2$. Thus $c = \\frac{2500-k^2}{200}$.\nSince $c$ is an integer, $2500-k^2$ must be divisible by 200.\n$2500 = 200 \\cdot 12.5$, so $k^2$ must be even, which means $k$ is even. Let $k=2m$.\nThen $2500-200c = 4m^2$, so $2500-4m^2 = 200c$. Thus $c = \\frac{2500-4m^2}{200} = \\frac{2500}{200} - \\frac{4m^2}{200} = \\frac{25}{2} - \\frac{m^2}{50}$.\nSince $c$ is an integer, $m^2$ must be divisible by 50. Since $50 = 2 \\cdot 5^2$, $m$ must be divisible by $2 \\cdot 5 = 10$. Let $m=10n$.\nThen $m^2 = 100n^2$, so $c = \\frac{25}{2} - \\frac{100n^2}{50} = \\frac{25}{2} - 2n^2$.\nSince $c$ is an integer, $n$ must be such that $\\frac{25}{2}-2n^2$ is an integer. This is only possible if $n=0$.\nIf $n=0$, then $m=0$, so $k=0$, and $c=12.5$, which is not an integer.\nLet $a=18$ and $b=32$. Then $\\sqrt{18}+\\sqrt{32} = 3\\sqrt{2}+4\\sqrt{2} = 7\\sqrt{2} = \\sqrt{98}$.\nLet $a=50$ and $b=0$. Then $\\sqrt{50}+\\sqrt{0} = \\sqrt{50}$.\nIf $a=0$, $b=50$.

Since the order of the canoes does not matter, we divide by $4!$ to get the total number of ways to assign the people to the canoes.\nHowever, since the canoes are indistinguishable, we can simply choose the first pair in $\\binom{8}{2}$ ways, the second pair in $\\binom{6}{2}$ ways, the third pair in $\\binom{4}{2}$ ways, and the last pair in $\\binom{2}{2}$ ways. This gives\n$$ \\binom{8}{2} \\binom{6}{2} \\binom{4}{2} \\binom{2}{2} = \\frac{8 \\cdot 7}{2} \\cdot \\frac{6 \\cdot 5}{2} \\cdot \\frac{4 \\cdot 3}{2} \\cdot 1 = 28 \\cdot 15 \\cdot 6 \\cdot 1 = 2520 $$\nways to assign the people to the canoes.\n\nNow we want to find the number of ways to assign the people to the canoes such that no two of Barry, Carrie and Mary are in the same canoe.\nWe can choose the canoe for Barry in 4 ways. Then we can choose the canoe for Carrie in 3 ways. Then we can choose the canoe for Mary in 2 ways. The remaining 5 people can be assigned to the 4 canoes in pairs.\nLet the canoes be $C_1, C_2, C_3, C_4$.\nSuppose Barry is in $C_1$, Carrie is in $C_2$, and Mary is in $C_3$. Then we have 5 people left to assign to the 4 canoes. We need to choose 2 people for $C_1$, 2 people for $C_2$, 2 people for $C_3$, and 1 person for $C_4$.\nWe can choose 2 people for $C_1$ from the remaining 5 people in $\\binom{5}{2}$ ways. Then we can choose 2 people from the remaining 3 people for $C_2$ in $\\binom{3}{2}$ ways. Then we can choose 2 people from the remaining 1 person for $C_3$ in $\\binom{1}{2} = 0$ ways.\nThis is not correct.\n\nWe can think of this as a derangement problem. We have 3 people Barry, Carrie, and Mary. We want to assign them to 4 canoes such that no two of them are in the same canoe.\nFirst, we assign Barry, Carrie, and Mary to the 4 canoes. There are $\\binom{4}{1} \\binom{3}{1} \\binom{2}{1} = 4 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 2 = 24$ ways to assign them to 3 different canoes.\nThen we assign the remaining 5 people to the 4 canoes. We can choose 2 people for the first canoe in $\\binom{5}{2}$ ways, 2 people for the second canoe in $\\binom{3}{2}$ ways, 2 people for the third canoe in $\\binom{1}{2} = 0$ ways.\nThis is not correct.\n\nWe want to find the number of ways to assign the 8 people to the 4 canoes such that no two of Barry, Carrie, and Mary are in the same canoe.\nWe can choose 3 canoes for Barry, Carrie, and Mary in $\\binom{4}{3} = 4$ ways. Then we can assign Barry, Carrie, and Mary to the 3 chosen canoes in $3! = 6$ ways.\nThe remaining 5 people can be assigned to the 4 canoes in $\\binom{5}{2} \\binom{3}{2} \\binom{1}{1} = 10 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 1 = 30$ ways.\nSo the number of ways is $4 \\cdot 6 \\cdot 30 = 720$.\nThe probability is $\\frac{720}{2520} = \\frac{72}{252} = \\frac{36}{126} = \\frac{18}{63} = \\frac{6}{21} = \\frac{2}{7}$.\n\nLet's consider the number of ways to assign the 8 people to the 4 canoes such that no two of Barry, Carrie, and Mary are in the same canoe.\nFirst, we choose 3 canoes for Barry, Carrie, and Mary. There are $\\binom{4}{3} = 4$ ways to do this. Then we assign Barry, Carrie, and Mary to the 3 chosen canoes. There are $3! = 6$ ways to do this.\nNow we have 5 people left, and 4 canoes. We need to assign the 5 people to the 4 canoes such that each canoe has exactly 2 people.\nWe can choose 2 people for the first canoe in $\\binom{5}{2} = 10$ ways. Then we can choose 2 people from the remaining 3 people for the second canoe in $\\binom{3}{2} = 3$ ways. Then we can choose 2 people from the remaining 1 person for the third canoe in $\\binom{1}{2} = 0$ ways.\nThis is not correct.\n\nWe want to find the number of ways to assign the 8 people to the 4 canoes such that no two of Barry, Carrie, and Mary are in the same canoe.\nWe can choose 3 canoes for Barry, Carrie, and Mary in $\\binom{4}{3} = 4$ ways.

We choose 2 people for each canoe. The total number of ways is $\\binom{8}{2} \\binom{6}{2} \\binom{4}{2} \\binom{2}{2} = 28 \\cdot 15 \\cdot 6 \\cdot 1 = 2520$. Since the canoes are indistinguishable, we divide by $4! = 24$ to get $\\frac{2520}{24} = 105$.\nNow we want to find the number of ways to assign the people such that no two of Barry, Carrie, and Mary are in the same canoe.\nWe choose 3 canoes for Barry, Carrie, and Mary in $\\binom{4}{3} = 4$ ways. Then we assign Barry, Carrie, and Mary to the 3 chosen canoes in $3! = 6$ ways.\nThe remaining 5 people can be assigned to the 4 canoes in $\\binom{5}{2} \\binom{3}{2} \\binom{1}{1} = 10 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 1 = 30$ ways.\nSo the number of ways is $4 \\cdot 6 \\cdot 30 = 720$.\nThe probability is $\\frac{720}{105 \\cdot 4!} = \\frac{720}{105 \\cdot 24} = \\frac{720}{2520} = \\frac{2}{7}$.\n\nThe total number of ways to assign the people to the canoes is $\\frac{\\binom{8}{2} \\binom{6}{2} \\binom{4}{2} \\binom{2}{2}}{4!} = \\frac{28 \\cdot 15 \\cdot 6 \\cdot 1}{24} = 105$.\nThe number of ways to assign Barry, Carrie, and Mary to different canoes is $\\binom{4}{3} \\cdot 3! = 4 \\cdot 6 = 24$.\nThe remaining 5 people can be assigned to the 4 canoes in $\\binom{5}{2} \\binom{3}{2} \\binom{1}{1} = 10 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 1 = 30$ ways.\nSo the number of ways is $24 \\cdot 30 = 720$.\nThe probability is $\\frac{720}{105 \\cdot 4!} = \\frac{720}{105 \\cdot 24} = \\frac{720}{2520} = \\frac{2}{7}$.\n\nThe total number of ways to assign the people to the canoes is $\\frac{\\binom{8}{2} \\binom{6}{2} \\binom{4}{2} \\binom{2}{2}}{4!} = \\frac{28 \\cdot 15 \\cdot 6 \\cdot 1}{24} = 105$.\nThe number of ways to choose 3 canoes for Barry, Carrie, and Mary is $\\binom{4}{3} = 4$.

Since $c=0$, we have $r_1 r_2 = 0$. Thus, either $r_1 = 0$ or $r_2 = 0$.\nWithout loss of generality, let $r_1 = 0$. Then $f(x) = ax(x-r_2) = ax^2 - ar_2 x$.\nComparing this to $f(x) = ax^2 + bx$, we have $b = -ar_2$.\nSince $b = 15-15a$, we have $-ar_2 = 15-15a$, so $ar_2 = 15a - 15$.\nIf $a \\neq 0$, then $r_2 = 15 - \\frac{15}{a}$. Since $r_2$ is an integer, $a$ must be a divisor of 15. The divisors of 15 are $\\pm 1, \\pm 3, \\pm 5, \\pm 15$.\nIf $a=1$, then $r_2 = 15 - \\frac{15}{1} = 0$. Thus $f(x) = x^2 + 15x$.\nIf $a=-1$, then $r_2 = 15 - \\frac{15}{-1} = 15 - (-15) = 30$. Thus $f(x) = -x^2 + 30x$.\nIf $a=3$, then $r_2 = 15 - \\frac{15}{3} = 15 - 5 = 10$. Thus $f(x) = 3x^2 - 30x$.\nIf $a=-3$, then $r_2 = 15 - \\frac{15}{-3} = 15 - (-5) = 20$. Thus $f(x) = -3x^2 + 60x$.\nIf $a=5$, then $r_2 = 15 - \\frac{15}{5} = 15 - 3 = 12$. Thus $f(x) = 5x^2 - 60x$.\nIf $a=-5$, then $r_2 = 15 - \\frac{15}{-5} = 15 - (-3) = 18$. Thus $f(x) = -5x^2 + 90x$.\nIf $a=15$, then $r_2 = 15 - \\frac{15}{15} = 15 - 1 = 14$. Thus $f(x) = 15x^2 - 210x$.\nIf $a=-15$, then $r_2 = 15 - \\frac{15}{-15} = 15 - (-1) = 16$. Thus $f(x) = -15x^2 + 240x$.\nIf $a=0$, then $b=15$, so $f(x) = 15x$. But $f(15) = 15(15) = 225$, so $f(x) = 15x$ is a solution.\nThe possible values of $a$ are $\\pm 1, \\pm 3, \\pm 5, \\pm 15, 0$. There are 9 possible values for $a$.\nIf $r_2 = 0$, then $f(x) = ax^2$. Then $f(15) = a(15^2) = 225a = 225$, so $a=1$.\nThus, $f(x) = x^2$, but $f(0) = 0$, so $f(x) = x^2 + 0x$.\nWe have the following solutions:\n$a=1, r_2=0$: $f(x) = x^2 + 15x$\n$a=-1, r_2=30$: $f(x) = -x^2 + 30x$\n$a=3, r_2=10$: $f(x) = 3x^2 - 30x$\n$a=-3, r_2=20$: $f(x) = -3x^2 + 60x$\n$a=5, r_2=12$: $f(x) = 5x^2 - 60x$\n$a=-5, r_2=18$: $f(x) = -5x^2 + 90x$\n$a=15, r_2=14$: $f(x) = 15x^2 - 210x$\n$a=-15, r_2=16$: $f(x) = -15x^2 + 240x$\n$a=1, r_2=0$: $f(x) = x^2$\nThere are 9 solutions.\n\nFinal Answer: The final answer is $\\boxed{9}$"], "id": 2669, "generated_answers": ["9"], "gold_answer": "8", "is_correct": false, "answers_correctness": [false]}

Then $a_8 \\ge x+1, a_9 \\ge x+2, \\dots, a_{13} \\ge x+6$.\nSo, $a_7 + a_8 + \\dots + a_{13} \\ge x + (x+1) + \\dots + (x+6) = 7x + (1+2+3+4+5+6) = 7x + 21$.\nWe have $a_7 + a_8 + \\dots + a_{13} = 99$. So, $7x + 21 \\le 99$, which means $7x \\le 78$, so $x \\le \\frac{78}{7} \\approx 11.14$.\nSince $x$ is an integer, we have $x \\le 11$. So the largest possible value for $a_7$ is 11.\nThen we have $a_1 = 1, a_2 = 2, \\dots, a_6 = 6, a_7 = 11, a_8 = 12, a_9 = 13, a_{10} = 14, a_{11} = 15, a_{12} = 16, a_{13} = 17$.\nThe sum is $1+2+3+4+5+6+11+12+13+14+15+16+17 = 21 + 11+12+13+14+15+16+17 = 21 + 98 = 119$.\nWe need the sum to be 120. We can increase one of the elements by 1.\nIf we increase $a_7$ to 12, then we have $1+2+3+4+5+6+12+13+14+15+16+17+18 = 21 + 12+13+14+15+16+17+18 = 21 + 105 = 126$.\nInstead, let $a_1=1, a_2=2, \\dots, a_6=6$. Then $a_7+a_8+\\dots+a_{13} = 120 - 21 = 99$.\nWe want to minimize $a_8, \\dots, a_{13}$, so we set $a_8 = a_7+1, \\dots, a_{13} = a_7+6$.\nThen $a_7 + (a_7+1) + \\dots + (a_7+6) = 7a_7 + 21 = 99$, so $7a_7 = 78$, which means $a_7 = \\frac{78}{7}$, which is not an integer.\nWe want to find the largest integer $a_7$ such that $7a_7 + 21 \\le 99$, so $7a_7 \\le 78$, which means $a_7 \\le \\frac{78}{7} \\approx 11.14$. So $a_7 = 11$.\nThen $a_8 = 12, \\dots, a_{13} = 17$. The sum is $11+12+13+14+15+16+17 = 98$.\nWe need the sum to be 99, so we need to increase the sum by 1. We can increase $a_7$ to 12, but then we need to increase the sum by 2.\nLet $a_7 = 11$. Then $a_1, \\dots, a_6 = 1, \\dots, 6$. We have $a_7 + \\dots + a_{13} = 99$.\nWe have $a_7 = 11, a_8 = 12, \\dots, a_{13} = 17$. The sum is $11+12+13+14+15+16+17 = 98$.\nWe need to add 1 to the sum. We can increase $a_7$ to 12, so $a_8 = 13, \\dots, a_{13} = 18$. But we can only increase one element.\nInstead, we can set $a_1=1, \\dots, a_6=6, a_7=11, a_8=12, a_9=13, a_{10}=14, a_{11}=15, a_{12}=16, a_{13}=17$.\nThe sum is $1+2+3+4+5+6+11+12+13+14+15+16+17 = 21+98 = 119$.\nIf we set $a_1=1, \\dots, a_6=6, a_7=11, a_8=12, a_9=13, a_{10}=14, a_{11}=15, a_{12}=16, a_{13}=18$, the sum is $1+2+3+4+5+6+11+12+13+14+15+16+18 = 21+96 = 117$.\nLet $a_1=1, \\dots, a_6=6$.

The sum is $10+11+12+13+14+15+16 = 91$.\nWe need to add 8 to the sum. We can add 8 to $a_7$, so $a_7 = 18, a_8=19, \\dots, a_{13}=24$. But we need to keep the elements distinct.\n\nLet $a_1, \\dots, a_6 = 1, \\dots, 6$. Then $a_7 + \\dots + a_{13} = 99$.\nWe want to minimize $a_8, \\dots, a_{13}$.

The surface area of the cube is $6T^2 = 6(37^2) = 6(1369) = 8214$.\nThe square holes have side length 1. There are 6 faces, so there are 6 holes.\nThe area removed from each face is $1 \\times 1 = 1$. Since there are 6 faces, the total area removed is $6 \\times 1 = 6$.\nHowever, the holes are drilled through the cube, so the area removed from the faces is not just the area of the squares.

However, eighteen families arrive and are looking to move in. After much debate, the connotations of using negative house numbers are deemed unacceptable, and the city decides on an alternative plan. On July 17, Shewad Movers arrive and relocate every family from house $n$ to house $n+18$, for all positive $n$ (so that City Hall does not move). For example, the family in house number 17 moves to house number 35.\nRoss takes a walk starting at his house, which is number 34 . He first visits house $n_{1}$, such that $d\\left(n_{1}, 34\\right)=1 / 3$. He then goes to another house, $n_{2}$, such that $d\\left(n_{1}, n_{2}\\right)=1 / 3$. Continuing in that way, he visits houses $n_{3}, n_{4}, \\ldots$, and each time, $d\\left(n_{i}, n_{i+1}\\right)=1 / 3$.

{"question": "In ARMLopolis, every house number is a positive integer, and City Hall's address is 0. However, due to the curved nature of the cowpaths that eventually became the streets of ARMLopolis, the distance $d(n)$ between house $n$ and City Hall is not simply the value of $n$. Instead, if $n=3^{k} n^{\\prime}$, where $k \\geq 0$ is an integer and $n^{\\prime}$ is an integer not divisible by 3 , then $d(n)=3^{-k}$. For example, $d(18)=1 / 9$ and $d(17)=1$. Notice that even though no houses have negative numbers, $d(n)$ is well-defined for negative values of $n$. For example, $d(-33)=1 / 3$ because $-33=3^{1} \\cdot-11$. By definition, $d(0)=0$. Following the dictum \"location, location, location,\" this Power Question will refer to \"houses\" and \"house numbers\" interchangeably.\n\nCuriously, the arrangement of the houses is such that the distance from house $n$ to house $m$, written $d(m, n)$, is simply $d(m-n)$. For example, $d(3,4)=d(-1)=1$ because $-1=3^{0} \\cdot-1$.

Since $P$ is a palindrome, we have $p_i = p_{16-i}$ for $i=1, 2, \\dots, 7$. Thus, the palindrome is completely determined by the first 7 letters. We have $p_1, p_2, \\dots, p_7$ can be any of the 10 letters in the ARMLLexicon. Therefore, there are $10^7$ possible palindromes.\n\nWe are given that there are four consecutive letters that spell out $A R M L$. This means that $p_i = A$, $p_{i+1} = R$, $p_{i+2} = M$, $p_{i+3} = L$ for some $i$ such that $1 \\le i \\le 12$.\nSince $P$ is a palindrome, we have $p_i = p_{16-i}$, $p_{i+1} = p_{15-i}$, $p_{i+2} = p_{14-i}$, $p_{i+3} = p_{13-i}$.\nThus, we have $p_i = A$, $p_{i+1} = R$, $p_{i+2} = M$, $p_{i+3} = L$ and $p_{16-i} = A$, $p_{15-i} = R$, $p_{14-i} = M$, $p_{13-i} = L$.\nThis implies that $p_i = p_{16-i}$, $p_{i+1} = p_{15-i}$, $p_{i+2} = p_{14-i}$, $p_{i+3} = p_{13-i}$.\nSince $p_i = A$, $p_{i+1} = R$, $p_{i+2} = M$, $p_{i+3} = L$, we must have $p_{16-i} = A$, $p_{15-i} = R$, $p_{14-i} = M$, $p_{13-i} = L$.\nThus, we have $i \\le 12$ and $16-i \\le 15$, which means $i \\ge 1$. Also, $i \\le 12$.\nWe have $i, i+1, i+2, i+3$ are the positions of $A, R, M, L$ in the first 7 positions.\nAlso, $16-i, 15-i, 14-i, 13-i$ are the positions of $A, R, M, L$ in the last 8 positions.\nSince $p_i = p_{16-i}$, $p_{i+1} = p_{15-i}$, $p_{i+2} = p_{14-i}$, $p_{i+3} = p_{13-i}$, we have $A = A, R = R, M = M, L = L$.\nWe need to find the number of palindromes with $A R M L$ in consecutive positions.\nWe have $i$ can range from 1 to 12.\nIf $i=1$, then $p_1 = A, p_2 = R, p_3 = M, p_4 = L, p_{15} = A, p_{14} = R, p_{13} = M, p_{12} = L$.\nIf $i=2$, then $p_2 = A, p_3 = R, p_4 = M, p_5 = L, p_{14} = A, p_{13} = R, p_{12} = M, p_{11} = L$.\nIf $i=12$, then $p_{12} = A, p_{13} = R, p_{14} = M, p_{15} = L, p_4 = A, p_3 = R, p_2 = M, p_1 = L$.\nWe need to determine the number of choices for the remaining letters.\nIf $A R M L$ is in positions $i, i+1, i+2, i+3$, then $p_i = A, p_{i+1} = R, p_{i+2} = M, p_{i+3} = L$.\nSince $P$ is a palindrome, $p_{16-i} = A, p_{15-i} = R, p_{14-i} = M, p_{13-i} = L$.\nThe remaining positions are $1, 2, \\dots, i-1, i+4, \\dots, 7$.\nThe number of remaining positions is $7 - 4 = 3$.\nThe remaining positions are $1, 2, \\dots, i-1, i+4, \\dots, 7$.\nThe number of remaining positions is $7 - 4 = 3$.\nWe have 3 positions to fill, and each position can be any of the 10 letters.\nThus, there are $10^3 = 1000$ ways to fill the remaining positions.\nSince $i$ can range from 1 to 12, there are 12 possible positions for $A R M L$.\nHowever, we have $i \\le 7$ and $16-i \\le 7$, so $i \\ge 9$.

We want to find the probability that the roots of the polynomial $(x+u)(x+v)+4$ are integers.\nThe polynomial is $x^2 + (u+v)x + uv + 4$. Let the roots be $r_1$ and $r_2$. Then by Vieta's formulas, we have\n$$r_1 + r_2 = -(u+v)$$\n$$r_1 r_2 = uv + 4$$\nSince $r_1$ and $r_2$ are integers, $r_1 + r_2$ and $r_1 r_2$ must be integers. We have $u+v = -(r_1+r_2)$ and $uv+4 = r_1 r_2$.\nWe can write $u$ and $v$ as the roots of the quadratic equation $t^2 - (u+v)t + uv = 0$. Thus, $t^2 + (r_1+r_2)t + (r_1 r_2 - 4) = 0$.\nThe discriminant of this quadratic equation must be a perfect square, i.e.,\n$$(r_1+r_2)^2 - 4(r_1 r_2 - 4) = (r_1+r_2)^2 - 4r_1 r_2 + 16 = (r_1-r_2)^2 + 16$$\nmust be a perfect square. Let $(r_1-r_2)^2 + 16 = k^2$ for some integer $k$.\nThen $k^2 - (r_1-r_2)^2 = 16$, which means $(k-r_1+r_2)(k+r_1-r_2) = 16$.\nSince $k-r_1+r_2$ and $k+r_1-r_2$ are integers, we can list the pairs of factors of 16:\n$(1, 16), (2, 8), (4, 4), (8, 2), (16, 1), (-1, -16), (-2, -8), (-4, -4), (-8, -2), (-16, -1)$.\nCase 1: $k-r_1+r_2 = 1$ and $k+r_1-r_2 = 16$. Adding the two equations gives $2k = 17$, so $k = \\frac{17}{2}$, which is not an integer.\nCase 2: $k-r_1+r_2 = 2$ and $k+r_1-r_2 = 8$. Adding the two equations gives $2k = 10$, so $k = 5$. Then $5-r_1+r_2 = 2$, so $r_1-r_2 = 3$.\nCase 3: $k-r_1+r_2 = 4$ and $k+r_1-r_2 = 4$. Adding the two equations gives $2k = 8$, so $k = 4$. Then $4-r_1+r_2 = 4$, so $r_1-r_2 = 0$, which means $r_1 = r_2$. But we need distinct roots, so this case is not possible.\nCase 4: $k-r_1+r_2 = 8$ and $k+r_1-r_2 = 2$.

Then $-5-r_1+r_2 = -2$, so $r_1-r_2 = 3$.\nCase 8: $k-r_1+r_2 = -4$ and $k+r_1-r_2 = -4$. Adding the two equations gives $2k = -8$, so $k = -4$. Then $-4-r_1+r_2 = -4$, so $r_1-r_2 = 0$, which means $r_1 = r_2$. But we need distinct roots, so this case is not possible.\nCase 9: $k-r_1+r_2 = -8$ and $k+r_1-r_2 = -2$.

{"question": "David builds a circular table; he then carves one or more positive integers into the table at points equally spaced around its circumference.

This is equivalent to counting the number of distinct necklaces with $n$ beads, where the sum of the integers on the beads is 17.\nWe can use Burnside's Lemma to count the number of distinct tables. Let $X$ be the set of all possible arrangements of $n$ integers around the table, where the sum is 17. The number of such arrangements is $\\binom{16}{n-1}$.

This means that all the integers are the same, so $a_1 = a_2 = \\dots = a_n = \\frac{17}{n}$. Since $a_i$ must be an integer, $n$ must divide 17.

Then $3\\theta + 2\\alpha = 180^\\circ$, so $\\alpha = \\frac{180^\\circ - 3\\theta}{2}$.\nIn $\\triangle ABD$, we have $\\angle ADB = 180^\\circ - \\angle BAD - \\angle ABD = 180^\\circ - \\alpha - \\theta$.\nIn $\\triangle BCD$, we have $\\angle BDC = 180^\\circ - \\angle DBC - \\angle BCD = 180^\\circ - \\theta - \\alpha$.\nSince $\\angle ADB + \\angle BDC = 180^\\circ$, we have $(180^\\circ - \\alpha - \\theta) + (180^\\circ - \\theta - \\alpha) = 180^\\circ$, which implies $360^\\circ - 2\\alpha - 2\\theta = 180^\\circ$, so $180^\\circ = 2\\alpha + 2\\theta$, which means $\\alpha + \\theta = 90^\\circ$.\nSince $\\alpha = \\frac{180^\\circ - 3\\theta}{2}$, we have $\\frac{180^\\circ - 3\\theta}{2} + \\theta = 90^\\circ$, so $180^\\circ - 3\\theta + 2\\theta = 180^\\circ$, which implies $\\theta = 0^\\circ$. This is impossible.\n\nLet $\\angle ABC = 3\\theta$. Then $\\angle ABD = \\angle DBC = \\theta$.\nSince $AB = BC$, we have $\\angle BAC = \\angle BCA = \\alpha$. Then $3\\theta + 2\\alpha = 180^\\circ$.\nBy the Angle Bisector Theorem, $\\frac{AD}{CD} = \\frac{AB}{BC} = 1$, so $AD = CD$. This means $D$ is the midpoint of $AC$, so $AD = CD = \\frac{y}{2}$.\nIn $\\triangle ABD$, we have $\\frac{AD}{\\sin \\theta} = \\frac{AB}{\\sin \\angle ADB}$, so $\\frac{y/2}{\\sin \\theta} = \\frac{x}{\\sin \\angle ADB}$.\nIn $\\triangle BCD$, we have $\\frac{CD}{\\sin \\theta} = \\frac{BC}{\\sin \\angle BDC}$, so $\\frac{y/2}{\\sin \\theta} = \\frac{x}{\\sin \\angle BDC}$.\nSince $\\angle ADB + \\angle BDC = 180^\\circ$, we have $\\sin \\angle ADB = \\sin \\angle BDC$.\nThus, $\\frac{y/2}{\\sin \\theta} = \\frac{x}{\\sin \\angle ADB}$ and $\\frac{y/2}{\\sin \\theta} = \\frac{x}{\\sin \\angle BDC}$, so $\\frac{y}{2 \\sin \\theta} = \\frac{x}{\\sin \\angle ADB}$.\nThen $y \\sin \\angle ADB = 2x \\sin \\theta$.\nSince $\\angle ADB = 180^\\circ - (\\angle BAD + \\angle ABD) = 180^\\circ - (\\alpha + \\theta)$, we have $\\sin \\angle ADB = \\sin (\\alpha + \\theta)$.\nWe have $3\\theta + 2\\alpha = 180^\\circ$, so $\\alpha = \\frac{180^\\circ - 3\\theta}{2}$.\nThen $\\alpha + \\theta = \\frac{180^\\circ - 3\\theta}{2} + \\theta = \\frac{180^\\circ - \\theta}{2}$.\nSo $y \\sin \\left(\\frac{180^\\circ - \\theta}{2}\\right) = 2x \\sin \\theta$.\n$y \\cos \\frac{\\theta}{2} = 2x \\sin \\theta = 2x (2 \\sin \\frac{\\theta}{2} \\cos \\frac{\\theta}{2}) = 4x \\sin \\frac{\\theta}{2} \\cos \\frac{\\theta}{2}$.\nThen $y = 4x \\sin \\frac{\\theta}{2}$.\nSince $AB - BD = 7$, we have $x - BD = 7$, so $BD = x-7$.\nBy the Law of Sines in $\\triangle ABD$, $\\frac{BD}{\\sin \\angle BAD} = \\frac{AB}{\\sin \\angle ADB}$, so $\\frac{x-7}{\\sin \\alpha} = \\frac{x}{\\sin \\angle ADB}$.\nThen $(x-7) \\sin \\angle ADB = x \\sin \\alpha$.\n$(x-7) \\sin (\\alpha + \\theta) = x \\sin \\alpha$.\n$(x-7) \\sin \\left(\\frac{180^\\circ - 3\\theta}{2} + \\theta\\right) = x \\sin \\left(\\frac{180^\\circ - 3\\theta}{2}\\right)$.\n$(x-7) \\sin \\left(\\frac{180^\\circ - \\theta}{2}\\right) = x \\sin \\left(\\frac{180^\\circ - 3\\theta}{2}\\right)$.\n$(x-7) \\cos \\frac{\\theta}{2} = x \\cos \\frac{3\\theta}{2}$.\n$(x-7) \\cos \\frac{\\theta}{2} = x (4 \\cos^3 \\frac{\\theta}{2} - 3 \\cos \\frac{\\theta}{2})$.\n$(x-7) = x (4 \\cos^2 \\frac{\\theta}{2} - 3)$.\n$x-7 = 4x \\cos^2 \\frac{\\theta}{2} - 3x$.\n$4x \\cos^2 \\frac{\\theta}{2} = 4x - 7$.\n$\\cos^2 \\frac{\\theta}{2} = \\frac{4x-7}{4x}$.\nSince $\\cos^2 \\frac{\\theta}{2} \\le 1$, we have $\\frac{4x-7}{4x} \\le 1$, so $4x-7 \\le 4x$, which means $-7 \\le 0$, which is always true.\nSince $x$ and $y$ are integers, we need $4x-7 \\ge 0$, so $x \\ge \\frac{7}{4}$.\nAlso, $x > 7$ since $x-7 > 0$.\nLet $x=15$. Then $\\cos^2 \\frac{\\theta}{2} = \\frac{4(15)-7}{4(15)} = \\frac{60-7}{60} = \\frac{53}{60}$.\nThen $\\cos \\frac{\\theta}{2} = \\sqrt{\\frac{53}{60}}$.\n$y = 4x \\sin \\frac{\\theta}{2} = 4(15) \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{53}{60}} = 60 \\sqrt{\\frac{7}{60}} = 60 \\frac{\\sqrt{7}}{\\sqrt{60}} = 60 \\frac{\\sqrt{7}}{2 \\sqrt{15}} = 30 \\frac{\\sqrt{7}}{\\sqrt{15}} = 30 \\sqrt{\\frac{7}{15}} = 30 \\sqrt{\\frac{7}{15}}$.\nIf $x=15$, then $y = 4(15) \\sin \\frac{\\theta}{2}$. We have $\\cos^2 \\frac{\\theta}{2} = \\frac{53}{60}$, so $\\sin^2 \\frac{\\theta}{2} = 1 - \\frac{53}{60} = \\frac{7}{60}$.\nThen $\\sin \\frac{\\theta}{2} = \\sqrt{\\frac{7}{60}}$.

Specifically, \\(a\\) must be of the form \\(b^k\\) where \\(k\\) is a rational number.\n\n### Step 2: Identifying the Possible Values of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\)\nSince \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are integers, \\(k\\) must be an integer.

This suggests a different interpretation or a different approach might be needed. Let's re-evaluate the problem with the given answer in mind.\n\n### Step 6: Re-evaluating the Problem\nGiven the correct answer is 17, we need to consider if there is a different interpretation or a different approach. The pairs \\((a, b)\\) where \\(a = b^k\\) and \\(k > 1\\) are:\n\\[\n(4, 2), (9, 3), (16, 2), (16, 4), (25, 5), (36, 6), (49, 7)\n\\]\nEach pair \\((a, b)\\) and \\((b, a)\\) is counted once.

Thus, $x_i = \\pm 1$ for all $i$.\nIf $x_i = 1$ for all $i$, then $x_1 x_2 \\cdots x_k = 1$, which is consistent.\nIf $x_i = -1$ for all $i$, then $x_1 x_2 \\cdots x_k = (-1)^k$.\nWe need $(-1)^k = 1$, so $k$ must be even.\nIf $k$ is even, then $(1, 1, \\ldots, 1)$ is a special $k$-tuple.\nIf $k$ is odd, then $x_1 x_2 \\cdots x_k = 1$, but $x_i = \\pm 1$ for all $i$.\nLet $n$ be the number of $-1$'s in the tuple. Then $n$ must be even.\nWe have $x_1 x_2 \\cdots x_k = (-1)^n (1)^{k-n} = (-1)^n = 1$, so $n$ must be even.\nThe number of $k$-tuples with an even number of $-1$'s is $\\sum_{n=0}^{\\lfloor k/2 \\rfloor} \\binom{k}{2n} = 2^{k-1}$.\nWe want to find the smallest $k$ such that $2^{k-1} \\geq 2009$.\nWe have $2^{10} = 1024$, $2^{11} = 2048$. Thus, $k-1 \\geq 11$, so $k \\geq 12$.\nHowever, we have $x_i = \\frac{1}{x_1 x_2 \\cdots x_{i-1} x_{i+1} \\cdots x_k}$.\nIf $x_1 = x_2 = \\cdots = x_k = 1$, then $x_1 x_2 \\cdots x_k = 1$, so $x_i^2 = 1$ for all $i$.\nIf $x_1 = x_2 = \\cdots = x_k = -1$, then $x_1 x_2 \\cdots x_k = (-1)^k$.\nIf $k$ is even, then $x_1 x_2 \\cdots x_k = 1$, so $x_i^2 = 1$ for all $i$.\nIf $k$ is odd, then $x_1 x_2 \\cdots x_k = -1$, so $x_i^2 = -1$ for all $i$, which is impossible.\nThus, $k$ must be even.\nLet $k=11$. Then $x_1 x_2 \\cdots x_{11} = x_i^2$ for all $i$.\nIf $x_i = 1$ for all $i$, then $x_1 x_2 \\cdots x_{11} = 1$, so $x_i^2 = 1$.\nIf $x_i = -1$ for all $i$, then $x_1 x_2 \\cdots x_{11} = -1$, so $x_i^2 = -1$, which is impossible.\nIf $k=11$, we need to have $x_i = \\pm 1$.\nThen $x_1 x_2 \\cdots x_{11} = 1$, so the number of $-1$'s must be even.\nThe number of such tuples is $\\sum_{i=0}^5 \\binom{11}{2i} = 2^{10} = 1024$.\nIf $k=12$, then $x_1 x_2 \\cdots x_{12} = 1$, so the number of $-1$'s must be even.\nThe number of such tuples is $\\sum_{i=0}^6 \\binom{12}{2i} = 2^{11} = 2048$.\nThus, the smallest value of $k$ is 12.\n\nFinal Answer: The final answer is $\\boxed{12}$"], "id": 2852, "generated_answers": ["12"], "gold_answer": "12", "is_correct": true, "answers_correctness": [true]}

Since the ellipse is tangent to both the $x$-axis and $y$-axis in the first quadrant, we must have $h=k=a$, where $a$ is the length of the semi-major or semi-minor axis.\nThe foci are $(3,7)$ and $(d,7)$. The center of the ellipse is the midpoint of the foci, so\n$$ (h,k) = \\left( \\frac{3+d}{2}, \\frac{7+7}{2} \\right) = \\left( \\frac{3+d}{2}, 7 \\right) $$\nSince $h=k$, we have $\\frac{3+d}{2} = 7$, so $3+d = 14$, which means $d = 11$.\nHowever, this is not the correct answer.\n\nLet the foci be $F_1 = (3,7)$ and $F_2 = (d,7)$.

Therefore, 98712 is the largest 5-digit number with distinct digits that is divisible by 63.\n\nWe can also consider other arrangements of the digits 9, 8, 7, 6, 5.\n98756: $98756 \\div 63 \\approx 1568.22$\n98675: $98675 \\div 63 \\approx 1567.55$\n98657: $98657 \\div 63 \\approx 1567.51$\n98576: $98576 \\div 63 \\approx 1566.73$\n98567: $98567 \\div 63 \\approx 1566.69$\n98765 - 63 = 98702. $98702 \\div 63 \\approx 1568.12$\n98765 - 2(63) = 98765 - 126 = 98639. $98639 \\div 63 \\approx 1567.86$\n98765 - 3(63) = 98765 - 189 = 98576. $98576 \\div 63 \\approx 1566.73$\n98765 - 4(63) = 98765 - 252 = 98513. $98513 \\div 63 \\approx 1566.57$\n98765 - 5(63) = 98765 - 315 = 98450. $98450 \\div 63 \\approx 1566.4$\n98765 - 6(63) = 98765 - 378 = 98387. $98387 \\div 63 \\approx 1566.23$\n98765 - 7(63) = 98765 - 441 = 98324. $98324 \\div 63 \\approx 1566.06$\n98765 - 8(63) = 98765 - 504 = 98261. $98261 \\div 63 \\approx 1565.89$\n98765 - 9(63) = 98765 - 567 = 98198. $98198 \\div 63 \\approx 1565.72$\n98765 - 10(63) = 98765 - 630 = 98135. $98135 \\div 63 \\approx 1565.55$\n98765 - 11(63) = 98765 - 693 = 98072. $98072 \\div 63 \\approx 1565.38$\n98765 - 12(63) = 98765 - 756 = 98009. $98009 \\div 63 \\approx 1565.21$\n98765 - 13(63) = 98765 - 819 = 97946. $97946 \\div 63 \\approx 1565.04$\n98765 - 14(63) = 98765 - 882 = 97883. $97883 \\div 63 \\approx 1564.87$\n98765 - 15(63) = 98765 - 945 = 97820. $97820 \\div 63 \\approx 1564.7$\n98765 - 16(63) = 98765 - 1008 = 97757. $97757 \\div 63 \\approx 1564.53$\n98765 - 17(63) = 98765 - 1071 = 97694. $97694 \\div 63 \\approx 1564.36$\n98765 - 18(63) = 98765 - 1134 = 97631. $97631 \\div 63 \\approx 1564.19$\n98765 - 19(63) = 98765 - 1197 = 97568. $97568 \\div 63 \\approx 1564.02$\n98765 - 20(63) = 98765 - 1260 = 97505. $97505 \\div 63 \\approx 1563.85$\n98765 - 21(63) = 98765 - 1323 = 97442. $97442 \\div 63 \\approx 1563.68$\n98765 - 22(63) = 98765 - 1386 = 97379. $97379 \\div 63 \\approx 1563.51$\n98765 - 23(63) = 98765 - 1449 = 97316. $97316 \\div 63 \\approx 1563.34$\n98765 - 24(63) = 98765 - 1512 = 97253. $97253 \\div 63 \\approx 1563.17$\n98765 - 25(63) = 98765 - 1575 = 97190. $97190 \\div 63 \\approx 1563$\n98765 - 26(63) = 98765 - 1638 = 97127. $97127 \\div 63 \\approx 1562.83$\n98765 - 27(63) = 98765 - 1701 = 97064. $97064 \\div 63 \\approx 1562.66$\n98765 - 28(63) = 98765 - 1764 = 97001. $97001 \\div 63 \\approx 1562.49$\n98765 - 29(63) = 98765 - 1827 = 96938. $96938 \\div 63 \\approx 1562.32$\n98765 - 30(63) = 98765 - 1890 = 96875. $96875 \\div 63 \\approx 1562.15$\n98765 - 31(63) = 98765 - 1953 = 96812. $96812 \\div 63 \\approx 1561.98$\n98765 - 32(63) = 98765 - 2016 = 96749. $96749 \\div 63 \\approx 1561.81$\n98765 - 33(63) = 98765 - 2079 = 96686. $96686 \\div 63 \\approx 1561.64$\n98765 - 34(63) = 98765 - 2142 = 96623. $96623 \\div 63 \\approx 1561.47$\n98765 - 35(63) = 98765 - 2205 = 96560. $96560 \\div 63 \\approx 1561.3$\n98765 - 36(63) = 98765 - 2268 = 96497. $96497 \\div 63 \\approx 1561.13$\n98765 - 37(63) = 98765 - 2331 = 96434. $96434 \\div 63 \\approx 1560.96$\n98765 - 38(63) = 98765 - 2394 = 96371. $96371 \\div 63 \\approx 1560.79$\n98765 - 39(63) = 98765 - 2457 = 96308. $96308 \\div 63 \\approx 1560.62$\n98765 - 40(63) = 98765 - 2520 = 96245. $96245 \\div 63 \\approx 1560.45$\n98765 - 41(63) = 98765 - 2583 = 96182. $96182 \\div 63 \\approx 1560.28$\n98765 - 42(63) = 98765 - 2646 = 96119. $96119 \\div 63 \\approx 1560.11$\n98765 - 43(63) = 98765 - 2709 = 96056. $96056 \\div 63 \\approx 1559.94$\n98765 - 44(63) = 98765 - 2772 = 95993. $95993 \\div 63 \\approx 1559.77$\n98765 - 45(63) = 98765 - 2835 = 95930. $95930 \\div 63 \\approx 1559.6$\n98765 - 46(63) = 98765 - 2898 = 95867. $95867 \\div 63 \\approx 1559.43$\n98765 - 47(63) = 98765 - 2961 = 95804. $95804 \\div 63 \\approx 1559.26$\n98765 - 48(63) = 98765 - 3024 = 95741. $95741 \\div 63 \\approx 1559.09$\n98765 - 49(63) = 98765 - 3087 = 95678. $95678 \\div 63 \\approx 1558.92$\n98765 - 50(63) = 98765 - 3150 = 95615. $95615 \\div 63 \\approx 1558.75$\n98765 - 51(63) = 98765 - 3213 = 95552. $95552 \\div 63 \\approx 1558.58$\n98765 - 52(63) = 98765 - 3276 = 95489. $95489 \\div 63 \\approx 1558.41$\n98765 - 53(63) = 98765 - 3339 = 95426. $95426 \\div 63 \\approx 1558.24$\n98765 - 54(63) = 98765 - 3402 = 95363. $95363 \\div 63 \\approx 1558.07$\n98765 - 55(63) = 98765 - 3465 = 95300. $95300 \\div 63 \\approx 1557.9$\n\nThe largest 5-digit number with distinct digits divisible by 63 is 98712.\n\nFinal Answer: The final answer is $\\boxed{98712}$"], "id": 2971, "generated_answers": ["98712"], "gold_answer": "98721", "is_correct": false, "answers_correctness": [false]}

We are given that $a+b+c = 2019$, and $a, b, c$ are integers. Also, $AD = 229$.\nBy the Angle Bisector Theorem, we have $\\frac{AD}{BD} = \\frac{AC}{BC}$, so $\\frac{229}{BD} = \\frac{b}{a}$. Thus $229a = bBD$. Since $BD = c - AD = c - 229$, we have $229a = b(c-229)$.\nWe are also given that $\\gcd(AC, AD) = \\gcd(b, 229) = 1$. Since 229 is a prime number, this means that $b$ is not divisible by 229.\nFrom $229a = b(c-229)$, we have $a = \\frac{b(c-229)}{229}$. Since $a$ is an integer, $229$ must divide $b(c-229)$. Since $\\gcd(b, 229) = 1$, we must have $229$ divides $c-229$, which means $c-229 = 229k$ for some integer $k$. Thus $c = 229(k+1)$.\nWe have $a+b+c = 2019$, so $a+b+229(k+1) = 2019$, which means $a+b = 2019 - 229(k+1) = 2019 - 229k - 229 = 1790 - 229k$.\nSince $a = \\frac{b(c-229)}{229} = \\frac{b(229k)}{229} = bk$, we have $a+b = bk+b = b(k+1)$.\nThus $b(k+1) = 1790 - 229k$. So $b = \\frac{1790 - 229k}{k+1} = \\frac{1790 + 179 - 179k - 229k}{k+1} = \\frac{1969 - 408k}{k+1} = \\frac{1969 - 408(k+1) + 408}{k+1} = \\frac{2377 - 408(k+1)}{k+1} = \\frac{2377}{k+1} - 408$.\nSince $b$ is an integer, $k+1$ must divide 2377.

Then $c = 229(0+1) = 229$, $b = \\frac{2377}{1} - 408 = 2377 - 408 = 1969$, and $a = bk = 1969(0) = 0$. This is impossible since $a, b, c$ are side lengths of a triangle.\nIf $k+1 = 2377$, then $k = 2376$. Then $c = 229(2377) = 541753$, $b = \\frac{2377}{2377} - 408 = 1 - 408 = -407$. This is impossible since $b$ must be positive.\nHowever, we have $a+b+c = 2019$, so $a+b = 2019-c$. Also, $a = bk$, so $bk+b = 2019-c$. Thus $b(k+1) = 2019-c$.\nWe have $b = \\frac{2377}{k+1} - 408 > 0$, so $\\frac{2377}{k+1} > 408$, which means $k+1 < \\frac{2377}{408} \\approx 5.85$.

Then $a+b+229m = 2019$, so $a+b = 2019 - 229m$.\nAlso, $229a = b(229m-229) = 229b(m-1)$, so $a = b(m-1)$.\nThen $a+b = b(m-1)+b = bm = 2019 - 229m$.\nThus $b = \\frac{2019-229m}{m} = \\frac{2019}{m} - 229$.\nSince $b>0$, we have $\\frac{2019}{m} > 229$, so $m < \\frac{2019}{229} \\approx 8.82$.
