Then $2(3a + 5b) + 15c = 3k$. Since $15c$ is a multiple of $3$, we must have $2(3a + 5b)$ is a multiple of $3$, which means $3a + 5b$ is a multiple of $3$. Thus $3a + 5b = 3m$ for some integer $m$.

Since $6 \\equiv 0 \\pmod{3}$, $10 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{3}$, and $15 \\equiv 0 \\pmod{3}$, we can write $x \\equiv 0a + 1b + 0c \\equiv b \\pmod{3}$. Thus, we can express any integer $x$ that is $0, 1, 2 \\pmod{3}$.\n\nHowever, we also need to consider the integers modulo 2.
