Then $D(x, y)$ is the unique integer such that $2^{D(x, y)} \\leq |x-y| < 2^{D(x, y)+1}$.\nIf $D(x, y) = d$, then $2^d \\leq |x-y| < 2^{d+1}$.\nLet $x_1, x_2, \\dots, x_n$ be the elements of $\\mathcal{F}$.\nFor each $i$, we have $S(x_i) = \\{D(x_i, x_j) \\mid j \\neq i\\}$.\nWe are given that $|S(x_i)| \\leq k$ for all $i$.\n\nConsider the case where $k=1$. Then $S(x) = \\{d\\}$ for all $x \\in \\mathcal{F}$.\nThis means that for any $x, y \\in \\mathcal{F}$, $D(x, y) = d$.\nThus, $2^d \\leq |x-y| < 2^{d+1}$ for all $x \\neq y$.\nIf $n=3$, let $x_1, x_2, x_3 \\in \\mathcal{F}$.\nThen $D(x_1, x_2) = D(x_1, x_3) = D(x_2, x_1) = D(x_2, x_3) = D(x_3, x_1) = D(x_3, x_2) = d$.\nThis implies that $2^d \\leq |x_1-x_2| < 2^{d+1}$, $2^d \\leq |x_1-x_3| < 2^{d+1}$, $2^d \\leq |x_2-x_3| < 2^{d+1}$.\nWithout loss of generality, assume $x_1 < x_2 < x_3$.\nThen $x_2 - x_1 \\geq 2^d$, $x_3 - x_1 \\geq 2^d$, $x_3 - x_2 \\geq 2^d$.\nWe have $x_3 - x_1 = (x_3 - x_2) + (x_2 - x_1) \\geq 2 \\cdot 2^d = 2^{d+1}$, which is a contradiction.\nSo $n \\leq 2$.\n\nIf $k=2$, we can have $n=3$.\nLet $x_1, x_2, x_3 \\in \\mathcal{F}$.\nThen $S(x_1) = \\{d_1, d_2\\}$, $S(x_2) = \\{d_1, d_2\\}$, $S(x_3) = \\{d_1, d_2\\}$.\nWe have $D(x_1, x_2) = d_1$, $D(x_1, x_3) = d_2$.\nThen $2^{d_1} \\leq |x_1-x_2| < 2^{d_1+1}$ and $2^{d_2} \\leq |x_1-x_3| < 2^{d_2+1}$.\nWithout loss of generality, assume $x_1 < x_2 < x_3$.\nThen $x_2 - x_1 \\geq 2^{d_1}$ and $x_3 - x_1 \\geq 2^{d_2}$.\nIf $d_1 = d_2$, then $S(x_1) = \\{d_1\\}$, which means $D(x_1, x_2) = D(x_1, x_3) = d_1$.\nThen $2^{d_1} \\leq |x_1-x_2| < 2^{d_1+1}$ and $2^{d_1} \\leq |x_1-x_3| < 2^{d_1+1}$.\nWe have $x_2 - x_1 \\geq 2^{d_1}$ and $x_3 - x_1 \\geq 2^{d_1}$.\nThen $x_3 - x_2 = (x_3 - x_1) - (x_2 - x_1) \\geq 2^{d_1} - 2^{d_1} = 0$.\nIf $x_3 - x_2 \\geq 2^{d_1}$, then $D(x_2, x_3) = d_1$, so $S(x_2) = \\{d_1\\}$.\nIf $x_3 - x_2 < 2^{d_1}$, then $D(x_2, x_3) < d_1$, which is a contradiction.\n\nConsider the case $k=n-1$.

We have $S(x_1) = \\{d_1, d_2\\}$, $S(x_2) = \\{d_1, d_3\\}$, $S(x_3) = \\{d_2, d_3\\}$.\nThen $D(x_1, x_2) = d_1$, $D(x_1, x_3) = d_2$, $D(x_2, x_3) = d_3$.\nWe have $2^{d_1} \\leq |x_1-x_2| < 2^{d_1+1}$, $2^{d_2} \\leq |x_1-x_3| < 2^{d_2+1}$, $2^{d_3} \\leq |x_2-x_3| < 2^{d_3+1}$.\nWithout loss of generality, assume $x_1 < x_2 < x_3$.\nThen $x_2 - x_1 \\geq 2^{d_1}$, $x_3 - x_1 \\geq 2^{d_2}$, $x_3 - x_2 \\geq 2^{d_3}$.\nWe have $x_3 - x_1 = (x_3 - x_2) + (x_2 - x_1) \\geq 2^{d_3} + 2^{d_1}$.\nThus, $2^{d_2} \\leq x_3 - x_1 \\geq 2^{d_3} + 2^{d_1}$.\nIf $d_1 = d_2 = d_3 = d$, then $2^d \\leq |x_1-x_2|, |x_1-x_3|, |x_2-x_3| < 2^{d+1}$.\nThis implies that $x_1, x_2, x_3$ are close to each other.\n\nIf $k=1$, then $n \\leq 2$.\nIf $k=2$, then $n \\leq 3$.\nIf $k=3$, then $n \\leq 4$.\nWe can conjecture that $n \\leq k+1$.\nIf $n=k+1$, then we have $k$ different scales.\nLet $x_1, x_2, \\dots, x_{k+1} \\in \\mathcal{F}$.\nThen $S(x_i) = \\{d_1, d_2, \\dots, d_k\\}$ for $i=1, 2, \\dots, k+1$.\nWe have $D(x_i, x_j) \\in \\{d_1, d_2, \\dots, d_k\\}$ for $i \\neq j$.\nThe number of pairs $(i, j)$ is $n(n-1) = (k+1)k$.\nThe number of possible values for $D(x_i, x_j)$ is $k$.\nThus, we must have $k \\geq (k+1)k$, which is impossible.\n\nFinal Answer: The final answer is $\\boxed{k+1}$"], "id": 1920, "generated_answers": ["k+1"], "gold_answer": "$2^{k}$", "is_correct": false, "answers_correctness": [false]}

Then $f(a^2) = a^3$.\n$P(x,1) \\implies f(x^2 a^2) = f(x)^2 a$.\n$P(1,x) \\implies f(a^2 f(x)^2) = f(1)^2 f(x) = a^2 f(x)$.\n\nIf $f(x) = c$ for some constant $c$, then $c = c^3$, so $c^2 = 1$, and $c = 1$ since $c > 0$. Thus $f(x) = 1$ for all $x \\in \\mathbb{Q}_{>0}$. But $f(x) = 1$ does not satisfy the given equation.\n\nLet $x = 1$. Then $f(f(y)^2) = f(1)^2 f(y)$. Let $f(1) = a$. Then $f(f(y)^2) = a^2 f(y)$.\nLet $y = 1$. Then $f(x^2 f(1)^2) = f(x)^2 f(1)$. Then $f(x^2 a^2) = f(x)^2 a$.\nLet $f(y) = y$. Then $f(x^2 y^2) = f(x)^2 y$. If $f(x) = x$, then $x^2 y^2 = x^2 y$, which is not true for all $x, y$.\n\nLet $f(x) = x^k$ for some $k \\in \\mathbb{Q}$. Then $(x^2 (y^k)^2)^k = (x^2)^k (y^k)$, so $x^{2k} y^{2k^2} = x^{2k} y^k$.

Thus $k = 0$ or $k = \\frac{1}{2}$.\nIf $k = 0$, then $f(x) = 1$ for all $x$, which we have already shown is not a solution.\nIf $k = \\frac{1}{2}$, then $f(x) = x^{\\frac{1}{2}} = \\sqrt{x}$. Then $f(x^2 f(y)^2) = f(x^2 (\\sqrt{y})^2) = f(x^2 y) = (x^2 y)^{\\frac{1}{2}} = x \\sqrt{y}$. Also, $f(x)^2 f(y) = (\\sqrt{x})^2 \\sqrt{y} = x \\sqrt{y}$. Thus $f(x) = \\sqrt{x}$ is a solution.\n\nNow, we show that $f(x) = \\sqrt{x}$ is the only solution.\nLet $x = \\sqrt{y}$. Then $f(y f(y)^2) = f(\\sqrt{y})^2 f(y)$. Let $y = 1$.

There are 4 choices. Then we assign Carrie to a canoe. There are 3 choices. Then we assign Mary to a canoe. There are 2 choices. So there are $4 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 2 = 24$ ways to assign Barry, Carrie, and Mary to different canoes.\nThe remaining 5 people can be assigned to the canoes in $\\binom{5}{2} \\binom{3}{2} \\binom{1}{1} / 3! = \\frac{10 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 1}{6} = 5$ ways.\nSo the number of ways to assign the 8 people such that no two of Barry, Carrie and Mary are in the same canoe is $24 \\cdot 5 = 120$.\nHowever, this is not possible since $N = 105$.\n\nWe can think of this as assigning 4 canoes to 3 people. The number of ways to do this is $4 \\times 3 \\times 2 = 24$. Then we assign the remaining 5 people to the 4 canoes.

We are given that the slope of $WY$ is 2, so $\\frac{d}{c} = 2$, which means $d=2c$.\nSince $WX \\perp XY$, the product of their slopes is -1. The slope of $WX$ is $\\frac{b-0}{a-0} = \\frac{b}{a}$. The slope of $XY$ is $\\frac{d-b}{c-a}$. Thus, $\\frac{b}{a} \\cdot \\frac{d-b}{c-a} = -1$.\nSubstituting $d=2c$, we have $\\frac{b}{a} \\cdot \\frac{2c-b}{c-a} = -1$.\nAlso, since $WX = XY$, we have $a^2+b^2 = (c-a)^2 + (d-b)^2$.

Then $N = 21a$. We want $N$ to be a palindrome in base 14, so $N = b \\cdot 14 + b = 15b$ for some digit $b$ in base 14, so $1 \\le b \\le 13$. Thus, $21a = 15b$, which means $7a = 5b$. Since 7 and 5 are coprime, $a$ must be a multiple of 5 and $b$ must be a multiple of 7. So $a = 5k$ and $b = 7k$ for some integer $k$. Since $1 \\le a \\le 19$ and $1 \\le b \\le 13$, we have $1 \\le 5k \\le 19$ and $1 \\le 7k \\le 13$. Thus, $\\frac{1}{5} \\le k \\le \\frac{19}{5} = 3.8$ and $\\frac{1}{7} \\le k \\le \\frac{13}{7} \\approx 1.857$. The only integer value for $k$ that satisfies both inequalities is $k=1$. Then $a=5$ and $b=7$, so $N = 21(5) = 105 = 15(7)$. In base 20, $105 = 5 \\cdot 20 + 5$, so $N = (55)_{20}$. In base 14, $105 = 7 \\cdot 14 + 7$, so $N = (77)_{14}$. Since $105 > 20$, we have found a candidate for $N$.\n\nIf $N$ is a 3-digit palindrome in base 20, then $N = a \\cdot 20^2 + a \\cdot 20 + a = a(20^2 + 20 + 1) = a(400+20+1) = 421a$ for some digit $a$ in base 20, so $1 \\le a \\le 19$. Then $N = 421a$. We want $N$ to be a palindrome in base 14, so $N = b \\cdot 14^2 + b \\cdot 14 + b = b(14^2 + 14 + 1) = b(196+14+1) = 211b$ for some digit $b$ in base 14, so $1 \\le b \\le 13$. Thus, $421a = 211b$, which means $421a = 211b$. Since 421 and 211 are coprime, $a$ must be a multiple of 211 and $b$ must be a multiple of 421. But $1 \\le a \\le 19$ and $1 \\le b \\le 13$, so there are no solutions.\n\nWe have found that $N = 105$ is a palindrome in both base 20 and base 14. Since $105 > 20$, we have found the least integer greater than 20 that is a palindrome in both base 20 and base 14.\n\nFinal Answer: The final answer is $\\boxed{105}$"], "id": 2604, "generated_answers": ["105"], "gold_answer": "105", "is_correct": true, "answers_correctness": [true]}

Since the graph of $f(x)$ passes through $(0,0)$, we have $f(0) = a(0)^2 + b(0) + c = c = 0$. Thus, $f(x) = ax^2 + bx$.\nSince the graph of $f(x)$ passes through $(15,225)$, we have $f(15) = a(15)^2 + b(15) = 225$, which simplifies to $225a + 15b = 225$. Dividing by 15, we get $15a + b = 15$, so $b = 15 - 15a$.\nThus, $f(x) = ax^2 + (15-15a)x = ax^2 + 15x - 15ax = ax(x-15) + 15x$.\nSince $f(x)$ has integer roots, we can write $f(x) = a(x-r_1)(x-r_2)$ for some integers $r_1$ and $r_2$. Expanding this, we get $f(x) = a(x^2 - (r_1+r_2)x + r_1 r_2) = ax^2 - a(r_1+r_2)x + ar_1 r_2$.\nComparing this to $f(x) = ax^2 + bx$, we have $b = -a(r_1+r_2)$ and $0 = ar_1 r_2$.

Without loss of generality, let $r_1 = 0$. Then $f(x) = ax(x-r_2) = ax^2 - ar_2 x$.\nSince $f(15) = 225$, we have $a(15^2) - ar_2 (15) = 225$, so $225a - 15ar_2 = 225$. Dividing by 15, we have $15a - ar_2 = 15$, so $a(15-r_2) = 15$.\nSince $a$ and $r_2$ are integers, $a$ must be a divisor of 15.

In particular, if $m=n$, then $d(m, n)=0$.\n\n\nThe neighborhood of a house $n$, written $\\mathcal{N}(n)$, is the set of all houses that are the same distance from City Hall as $n$. In symbols, $\\mathcal{N}(n)=\\{m \\mid d(m)=d(n)\\}$. Geometrically, it may be helpful to think of $\\mathcal{N}(n)$ as a circle centered at City Hall with radius $d(n)$.\n\nLater, ARMLopolis finally decides on a drastic expansion plan: now house numbers will be rational numbers. To define $d(p / q)$, with $p$ and $q$ integers such that $p q \\neq 0$, write $p / q=3^{k} p^{\\prime} / q^{\\prime}$, where neither $p^{\\prime}$ nor $q^{\\prime}$ is divisible by 3 and $k$ is an integer (not necessarily positive); then $d(p / q)=3^{-k}$.\nCompute $d(3 / 5), d(5 / 8)$, and $d(7 / 18)$.", "generated_responses": ["Let $n = \\frac{p}{q}$ be a rational number, where $p$ and $q$ are integers such that $pq \\neq 0$.

Thus $k=-2$ and $d(\\frac{7}{18}) = 3^{-(-2)} = 3^2 = 9$.\n\nThe distance from house $n$ to house $m$ is $d(m-n)$.

Let $k=11m$.\nThen $y = \\frac{2^2 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 11m}{11} = 2^2 \\cdot 3 \\cdot m = 12m$.\nThe smallest positive integer $y$ is when $m=1$, so $y=12$.\nLet's reconsider the problem. $x$ is the smallest positive integer such that $1584x$ is a perfect cube. $x = 2^2 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 11^2 = 1452$.\n$y$ is the smallest positive integer such that $x y$ is a multiple of 1584. $1452 y$ is a multiple of 1584.\n$1452 = 2^2 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 11^2$ and $1584 = 2^4 \\cdot 3^2 \\cdot 11$.\nWe need $2^2 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 11^2 \\cdot y$ to be divisible by $2^4 \\cdot 3^2 \\cdot 11$.\nSo $y$ must be divisible by $2^2 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 11^2 \\cdot z$ where $z$ is an integer such that $2^2 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 11^2 \\cdot y$ is divisible by $2^4 \\cdot 3^2 \\cdot 11$.\nWe need $2^2 \\cdot y$ to be divisible by $2^4$, so $y$ must be divisible by $2^2$.\nWe need $3 \\cdot y$ to be divisible by $3^2$, so $y$ must be divisible by $3$.\nWe need $11^2 \\cdot y$ to be divisible by $11$, so $y$ must be divisible by $11^0 = 1$.\nThus, $y$ must be divisible by $2^2 \\cdot 3 = 12$.\nHowever, we want the smallest $y$ such that $1452 y$ is a multiple of 1584.\n$1452 y = 1584 k$ for some integer $k$.\n$y = \\frac{1584 k}{1452} = \\frac{2^4 \\cdot 3^2 \\cdot 11 k}{2^2 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 11^2} = \\frac{2^2 \\cdot 3 \\cdot k}{11}$.\nFor $y$ to be an integer, $k$ must be a multiple of 11. Let $k=11$.\nThen $y = \\frac{2^2 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 11}{11} = 2^2 \\cdot 3 = 12$.\nLet's check if $y=12$ works. $1452 \\cdot 12 = 17424$.\n$\\frac{17424}{1584} = 11$.\nSo $1452 \\cdot 12 = 1584 \\cdot 11$.\nSo $y=12$ is the smallest positive integer such that $1452 y$ is a multiple of 1584.\nI made an error.

The pairs $(a_2, a_3)$ are $(3, 11), (4, 10), (5, 9), (7, 7)$. There are 4 triples.\nIf $a_1 = 4$, then $a_2 + a_3 = 13$. We have $4 \\le a_2 \\le a_3$. So $a_2 \\le 6$. The pairs $(a_2, a_3)$ are $(4, 9), (5, 8), (6, 7)$. There are 3 triples.\nIf $a_1 = 5$, then $a_2 + a_3 = 12$. We have $5 \\le a_2 \\le a_3$. So $a_2 \\le 6$. The pairs $(a_2, a_3)$ are $(5, 7), (6, 6)$. There are 2 triples.\nIf $a_1 = 6$, then $a_2 + a_3 = 11$. We have $6 \\le a_2 \\le a_3$.

We want to find the largest $k$ such that $2k+1 \\le 2011$, so $2k \\le 2010$, and $k \\le 1005$.\nThus, $k$ can be any integer from $0$ to $1005$, so there are $1006$ possible values for $k$.\nWhen $n$ is even, $n \\le 2012$, so $2k \\le 2012$, which means $k \\le 1006$. Thus there are $1006$ possible values for $k$.\nThe number of positive integers $n$ such that $n !!$ divides $2012 !! $ is $1006 + 1006 = 2012$.\nHowever, we need to consider the case when $n$ is odd.\nIf $n=2k+1$, then $n !! = (2k+1)(2k-1) \\cdots 1$. We want this to divide $2^{1006} \\cdot 1006!$.\nSince $n !!$ is odd, it must divide $1006!$. We need $2k+1 \\le 1006$, so $2k \\le 1005$, and $k \\le 502.5$.\nThus $k$ can be any integer from $0$ to $502$, so there are $503$ possible values for $k$.\nThen $n$ can be $1, 3, 5, \\dots, 1005$.\nThe number of even integers $n$ such that $n \\le 2012$ is $1006$.\nThe number of odd integers $n$ such that $n \\le 2011$ is $503$.\nThe total number of integers is $1006 + 503 = 1509$.\n\nWe have $2012 !! = 2^{1006} \\cdot 1006!$.\nIf $n$ is even, $n=2k$, then $n !! = 2^k k!$. We want $2^k k!$ to divide $2^{1006} \\cdot 1006!$. This is true if $k \\le 1006$, so $n \\le 2012$. There are $1006$ such values.\nIf $n$ is odd, $n=2k+1$, then $n !! = (2k+1)(2k-1) \\cdots 1$. We want $(2k+1)(2k-1) \\cdots 1$ to divide $2^{1006} \\cdot 1006!$. Since the product is odd, it must divide $1006!$. We want $2k+1 \\le 1006$, so $2k \\le 1005$, $k \\le 502.5$. Thus $k \\le 502$, so $n \\le 1005$. There are $503$ such values.\nThe total number of values is $1006 + 503 = 1509$.\n\nLet $n=2k+1$. Then $n!! = (2k+1)(2k-1) \\dots 1$. We want this to divide $2^{1006} \\cdot 1006!$. Since $n!!$ is odd, it must divide $1006!$. Thus $(2k+1)(2k-1) \\dots 1 \\le 1006!$. We also have $2k+1 \\le 1006$, so $2k \\le 1005$, $k \\le 502.5$. Thus $k \\le 502$. So $n \\le 1005$. For each $k$ from 0 to 502, we have an odd $n$.\nIf $n=2k$, then $n!! = 2^k k!$. We want $2^k k!$ to divide $2^{1006} \\cdot 1006!$. This means $k \\le 1006$ and $k!$ divides $1006!$. So $k \\le 1006$. For each $k$ from 1 to 1006, we have an even $n$.\nThe number of odd $n$ is $502+1 = 503$. The number of even $n$ is $1006$.

Then $\\angle B = 3\\alpha$, so $\\cos \\angle B = \\cos 3\\alpha = 4 \\cos^3 \\alpha - 3 \\cos \\alpha$.\nWe have $y^2 = 2x^2(1 - (4 \\cos^3 \\alpha - 3 \\cos \\alpha)) = 2x^2(1 - 4 \\cos^3 \\alpha + 3 \\cos \\alpha)$.\nAlso, $\\frac{a}{y-a} = \\frac{x}{x-7}$, so $a(x-7) = x(y-a)$, which means $ax - 7a = xy - ax$, so $2ax - 7a = xy$.\nThen $a(2x - 7) = xy$, so $a = \\frac{xy}{2x-7}$.\nSince $a > 0$, we must have $2x - 7 > 0$, so $x > \\frac{7}{2} = 3.5$.\nLet $x = 13$. Then $a = \\frac{13y}{26-7} = \\frac{13y}{19}$.\nSince $a$ is an integer, $19$ must divide $13y$, so $19$ must divide $y$.\nLet $y = 19k$ for some integer $k$. Then $a = \\frac{13(19k)}{19} = 13k$.\nThen $AC = 19k$, and $AD = 13k$, so $CD = 19k - 13k = 6k$.\nWe have $BD = x - 7 = 13 - 7 = 6$.\nBy the Angle Bisector Theorem, $\\frac{AD}{CD} = \\frac{AB}{BD}$, so $\\frac{13k}{6k} = \\frac{13}{6}$, which is true.\nIf $k = 1$, then $AC = 19$, $AD = 13$, $CD = 6$, and $BD = 6$.\nThen $AB = BC = 13$.\nThus, $AC = 19$.\n\nFinal Answer: The final answer is $\\boxed{19}$"], "id": 2796, "generated_answers": ["19"], "gold_answer": "146", "is_correct": false, "answers_correctness": [false]}

Then $x_k \\geq 0$ for all $1 \\leq k \\leq 8$.\nAlso, $d_k = x_k + k$, so $d_1 = x_1 + 1, d_2 = x_2 + 2, \\dots, d_8 = x_8 + 8$.\nSince $d_1 < d_2 < \\dots < d_8$, we have $x_1 + 1 < x_2 + 2 < \\dots < x_8 + 8$.\nWe have $1 \\leq d_1 < d_2 < \\dots < d_8 \\leq 9$.\nSo $d_1 \\geq 1, d_2 \\geq 2, \\dots, d_8 \\geq 8$.\nAlso, $d_1 \\leq 9 - 7 = 2$, so $d_1 = 1$.\n$d_2 \\leq 9 - 6 = 3$, so $d_2 = 2$.\n$d_3 \\leq 9 - 5 = 4$, so $d_3 = 3$.\n$d_4 \\leq 9 - 4 = 5$, so $d_4 = 4$.\n$d_5 \\leq 9 - 3 = 6$, so $d_5 = 5$.\n$d_6 \\leq 9 - 2 = 7$, so $d_6 = 6$.\n$d_7 \\leq 9 - 1 = 8$, so $d_7 = 7$.\n$d_8 = 8$ or $d_8 = 9$.\nIf $d_8 = 8$, then $d_1 = 1, d_2 = 2, \\dots, d_7 = 7, d_8 = 8$.\nIf $d_8 = 9$, then $d_1 = 1, d_2 = 2, \\dots, d_6 = 6, d_7 = 7, d_8 = 9$.\nWe need to choose 8 digits from $\\{1, 2, \\dots, 9\\}$ such that $d_k \\geq k$.\nWe can rewrite the condition as $d_1 \\geq 1, d_2 \\geq 2, \\dots, d_8 \\geq 8$.\nLet $d_k' = d_k - k$.

This means that $a$ and $b$ have no common prime factors.\nLet $a = 2^{x_1} \\cdot 3^{x_2} \\cdot 5^{x_3} \\cdot 7^{x_4} \\cdot 13^{x_5}$ and $b = 2^{y_1} \\cdot 3^{y_2} \\cdot 5^{y_3} \\cdot 7^{y_4} \\cdot 13^{y_5}$.\nThen $ab = 2^{x_1+y_1} \\cdot 3^{x_2+y_2} \\cdot 5^{x_3+y_3} \\cdot 7^{x_4+y_4} \\cdot 13^{x_5+y_5} = 2^{22} \\cdot 3^{12} \\cdot 5^{12} \\cdot 7^{12} \\cdot 13^{10}$.\nThus, we have the equations:\n$x_1 + y_1 = 22$\n$x_2 + y_2 = 12$\n$x_3 + y_3 = 12$\n$x_4 + y_4 = 12$\n$x_5 + y_5 = 10$\nSince $\\gcd(a, b) = 1$, we must have that for each prime $p$, either $x_i = 0$ or $y_i = 0$ for $i = 1, 2, 3, 4, 5$.\nFor each equation, we can choose which variable to set to 0.\nFor $x_1 + y_1 = 22$, we can have $x_1 = 0$ or $y_1 = 0$. If $x_1 = 0$, then $y_1 = 22$. If $y_1 = 0$, then $x_1 = 22$.\nFor $x_2 + y_2 = 12$, we can have $x_2 = 0$ or $y_2 = 0$. If $x_2 = 0$, then $y_2 = 12$. If $y_2 = 0$, then $x_2 = 12$.\nFor $x_3 + y_3 = 12$, we can have $x_3 = 0$ or $y_3 = 0$. If $x_3 = 0$, then $y_3 = 12$. If $y_3 = 0$, then $x_3 = 12$.\nFor $x_4 + y_4 = 12$, we can have $x_4 = 0$ or $y_4 = 0$. If $x_4 = 0$, then $y_4 = 12$. If $y_4 = 0$, then $x_4 = 12$.\nFor $x_5 + y_5 = 10$, we can have $x_5 = 0$ or $y_5 = 0$. If $x_5 = 0$, then $y_5 = 10$. If $y_5 = 0$, then $x_5 = 10$.\nWe have 2 choices for each equation. Thus, there are $2^5 = 32$ possible pairs $(a, b)$.\nHowever, we need to consider the case where we choose $x_i = 0$ for all $i$. This gives us $a = 1$, and $b = 2^{22} \\cdot 3^{12} \\cdot 5^{12} \\cdot 7^{12} \\cdot 13^{10}$.\nWe also need to consider the case where we choose $y_i = 0$ for all $i$. This gives us $b = 1$, and $a = 2^{22} \\cdot 3^{12} \\cdot 5^{12} \\cdot 7^{12} \\cdot 13^{10}$.\nSince we want the number of ordered pairs $(a, b)$ such that $\\gcd(a, b) = 1$, we have to consider the number of ways to distribute the prime factors between $a$ and $b$ such that they have no common factors.\nWe have 5 prime factors: 2, 3, 5, 7, 13. For each prime factor, we can assign it to either $a$ or $b$. Thus, there are $2^5 = 32$ possible ways to assign the prime factors.\nHowever, we must exclude the case where we assign all prime factors to $a$ or all prime factors to $b$.\nIf we assign all prime factors to $a$, then $a = 2^{22} \\cdot 3^{12} \\cdot 5^{12} \\cdot 7^{12} \\cdot 13^{10}$ and $b = 1$.\nIf we assign all prime factors to $b$, then $a = 1$ and $b = 2^{22} \\cdot 3^{12} \\cdot 5^{12} \\cdot 7^{12} \\cdot 13^{10}$.\nIn these two cases, $\\gcd(a, b) = 1$.\nSince we are looking for the number of ordered pairs $(a, b)$ such that $\\gcd(a, b) = 1$, we have $2^5 = 32$ possible pairs.\n\nFinal Answer: The final answer is $\\boxed{32}$"], "id": 2835, "generated_answers": ["32"], "gold_answer": "32", "is_correct": true, "answers_correctness": [true]}

{"question": "An $\\boldsymbol{n}$-label is a permutation of the numbers 1 through $n$. For example, $J=35214$ is a 5 -label and $K=132$ is a 3 -label.

We can associate to each of these blocks a $p$-label that corresponds to the relative order of the numbers in that block. For $L=263415$, we get the following:\n\n$$\n\\underline{263} 415 \\rightarrow 132 ; \\quad 2 \\underline{63415} \\rightarrow 312 ; \\quad 26 \\underline{341} 5 \\rightarrow 231 ; \\quad 263 \\underline{415} \\rightarrow 213\n$$\n\nMoving from left to right in the $n$-label, there are $n-p+1$ such blocks, which means we obtain an $(n-p+1)$-tuple of $p$-labels.

Also, $y_1 = y_3$ and $y_2 = y_4$.\nSo the vertices are $(a, b), (22-a, 10-b), (a, b), (22-a, 10-b)$.\nThe midpoint $R = \\left(\\frac{x_2+x_3}{2}, \\frac{y_2+y_3}{2}\\right) = \\left(\\frac{22-a+a}{2}, \\frac{10-b+b}{2}\\right) = (11, 5)$.\nHowever, this is the same as $A$.\nLet the vertices be $P_1 = (x_1, y_1)$, $P_2 = (x_2, y_2)$, $P_3 = (x_3, y_3)$, $P_4 = (x_4, y_4)$.\n$A = \\frac{P_1+P_2}{2} = (11, 5)$, so $x_1+x_2 = 22$ and $y_1+y_2 = 10$.\n$R = \\frac{P_2+P_3}{2}$, $M = \\frac{P_3+P_4}{2}$, $L = \\frac{P_4+P_1}{2}$.\nSince $R, M, L$ are lattice points, $x_2+x_3, x_3+x_4, x_4+x_1$ are even, and $y_2+y_3, y_3+y_4, y_4+y_1$ are even.\nThe area of the square is 650, so $(x_2-x_1)^2+(y_2-y_1)^2 = 650$.\nLet $x_2 = 11+a$ and $y_2 = 5+b$. Then $x_1 = 11-a$ and $y_1 = 5-b$.\nThen $(11+a-(11-a))^2 + (5+b-(5-b))^2 = 650$, so $(2a)^2 + (2b)^2 = 650$, which means $4a^2+4b^2 = 650$, so $a^2+b^2 = \\frac{650}{4} = \\frac{325}{2}$.\nSince $a^2+b^2 = \\frac{325}{2}$, we can write $a = \\frac{5}{\\sqrt{2}} \\cos \\theta$ and $b = \\frac{5}{\\sqrt{2}} \\sin \\theta$.\nSince $R$ is in Quadrant I, $x_2 > 0$ and $y_2 > 0$. So $11+a > 0$ and $5+b > 0$.\n$a > -11$ and $b > -5$.\n\nFinal Answer: The final answer is $\\boxed{40}$"], "id": 2893, "generated_answers": ["40"], "gold_answer": "10", "is_correct": false, "answers_correctness": [false]}

Since $3$ and $2$ are relatively prime, $n$ must be an even integer, say $n = 2k$ for some integer $k$. Then $3(2k) = 2m$, so $6k = 2m$, which means $m = 3k$. Thus, the numbers that occur in both sequences are of the form $\\frac{2k}{4} = \\frac{3k}{6} = \\frac{k}{2}$ for some non-negative integer $k$.\nThe numbers that occur in both sequences are $\\frac{0}{2}, \\frac{1}{2}, \\frac{2}{2}, \\frac{3}{2}, \\ldots$, which are $0, \\frac{1}{2}, 1, \\frac{3}{2}, \\ldots$. These are the terms of the arithmetic sequence with first term $0$ and common difference $\\frac{1}{2}$.\nWe want to find the $19^{\\text{th}}$ smallest number in this sequence. The $k^{\\text{th}}$ term is $\\frac{k-1}{2}$. Thus, the $19^{\\text{th}}$ term is $\\frac{19-1}{2} = \\frac{18}{2} = 9$.\nTherefore, the $19^{\\text{th}}$ smallest number that occurs in both sequences $\\mathcal{S}_{1}$ and $\\mathcal{S}_{2}$ is $9$.\n\nFinal Answer: The final answer is $\\boxed{9}$"], "id": 2902, "generated_answers": ["9"], "gold_answer": "9", "is_correct": true, "answers_correctness": [true]}

For example, $E(2,1)=2$ because Elizabeth cannot escape in one minute (there are two switches and one must be flipped every minute) but she can escape in two minutes (by flipping Switch 1 in the first minute and Switch 2 in the second minute).

To have all $n$ switches on, we need to flip each switch at least once. So $E(n, 1) = n$.\nIf $k=n$, then we flip all $n$ switches each minute. If we start with all switches off, then after one minute, all switches are on. So $E(n, n) = 1$.\nIf $k=2$, we flip two switches each minute. If $n=3$, we have switches 1, 2, 3. We can flip 1 and 2 in the first minute, 2 and 3 in the second minute, 1 and 3 in the third minute. After 3 minutes, all switches are on.
