We are given that the distance between cities $A$ and $B$ is 45 miles. Alicia bikes towards $B$ at 18 miles per hour, and Beth bikes towards $A$ at 12 miles per hour. They leave at the same time.\n\nSince they leave at the same time, the time it takes for Alicia to travel $d_A$ miles is the same as the time it takes for Beth to travel $d_B$ miles. We can write the time for Alicia as $t = \\frac{d_A}{18}$ and the time for Beth as $t = \\frac{d_B}{12}$. Since the times are equal, we have\n$$ \\frac{d_A}{18} = \\frac{d_B}{12} $$\nWe can rewrite this equation as $12d_A = 18d_B$, or $2d_A = 3d_B$. Thus, $d_B = \\frac{2}{3} d_A$.\n\nWe also know that the total distance they travel is 45 miles, so $d_A + d_B = 45$. Substituting $d_B = \\frac{2}{3} d_A$ into the equation $d_A + d_B = 45$, we get\n$$ d_A + \\frac{2}{3} d_A = 45 $$\n$$ \\frac{3}{3} d_A + \\frac{2}{3} d_A = 45 $$\n$$ \\frac{5}{3} d_A = 45 $$\n$$ d_A = 45 \\cdot \\frac{3}{5} $$\n$$ d_A = 9 \\cdot 3 $$\n$$ d_A = 27 $$\nThen $d_B = \\frac{2}{3} d_A = \\frac{2}{3} (27) = 2(9) = 18$.\nSo, Alicia travels 27 miles and Beth travels 18 miles. Since Alicia starts in city $A$, the distance from city $A$ where they meet is $d_A = 27$ miles.\n\nWe can check that the time it takes for Alicia to travel 27 miles is $\\frac{27}{18} = \\frac{3}{2} = 1.5$ hours. The time it takes for Beth to travel 18 miles is $\\frac{18}{12} = \\frac{3}{2} = 1.5$ hours.

Let $y$ be the imaginary part of $z$. We want to find the maximum value of $y$.\nLet $f(x,y) = (1+x+x^2-y^2)^2+(2xy+y)^2 - 16 = 0$. We want to find the maximum value of $y$.\nWe can consider this as a constraint problem. We want to maximize $g(x,y) = y$ subject to $f(x,y) = 0$.\nWe can use the method of Lagrange multipliers. We have\n$$\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x} = 2(1+x+x^2-y^2)(1+2x)+2(2xy+y)(2y) = 0$$\n$$\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial y} = 2(1+x+x^2-y^2)(-2y)+2(2xy+y)(2x+1) = 0$$\n$$\\frac{\\partial g}{\\partial x} = 0, \\quad \\frac{\\partial g}{\\partial y} = 1$$\nWe have $\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x} = 0$ and $\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial y} = 0$.\n$$2(1+x+x^2-y^2)(1+2x)+4y(2xy+y) = 0$$\n$$-2(1+x+x^2-y^2)(2y)+2(2xy+y)(2x+1) = 0$$\n$$(1+x+x^2-y^2)(1+2x)+2y(2xy+y) = 0$$\n$$-(1+x+x^2-y^2)(2y)+(2xy+y)(2x+1) = 0$$\nFrom the second equation, we have\n$$-2y(1+x+x^2-y^2)+(2xy+y)(2x+1) = 0$$\n$$-2y-2xy-2x^2y+2y^3+4x^2y+2xy+2xy+y = 0$$\n$$2y^3+2x^2y+2xy-2y = 0$$\n$$2y(y^2+x^2+xy-1) = 0$$\nSince we want to maximize $y$, we assume $y \\neq 0$. Then $y^2+x^2+xy-1=0$.\n$$x^2+xy+y^2-1=0$$\nWe can consider this as a quadratic in $x$.\n$$x = \\frac{-y \\pm \\sqrt{y^2-4(y^2-1)}}{2} = \\frac{-y \\pm \\sqrt{4-3y^2}}{2}$$\nFor $x$ to be real, we need $4-3y^2 \\geq 0$, so $3y^2 \\leq 4$, which means $y^2 \\leq \\frac{4}{3}$.\nThus, $-\\frac{2}{\\sqrt{3}} \\leq y \\leq \\frac{2}{\\sqrt{3}}$.\nWe want to find the maximum value of $y$.
