They leave at the same time.\n\nSince they leave at the same time, the time it takes for Alicia to travel $d_A$ miles is the same as the time it takes for Beth to travel $d_B$ miles. We can write the time for Alicia as $t = \\frac{d_A}{18}$ and the time for Beth as $t = \\frac{d_B}{12}$. Since the times are equal, we have\n$$ \\frac{d_A}{18} = \\frac{d_B}{12} $$\nWe can rewrite this equation as $12d_A = 18d_B$, or $2d_A = 3d_B$. We also know that the total distance they travel is 45 miles, so $d_A + d_B = 45$.\nWe can solve for $d_B$ in terms of $d_A$: $d_B = \\frac{2}{3}d_A$.\nSubstituting this into the equation $d_A + d_B = 45$, we get\n$$ d_A + \\frac{2}{3}d_A = 45 $$\n$$ \\frac{3}{3}d_A + \\frac{2}{3}d_A = 45 $$\n$$ \\frac{5}{3}d_A = 45 $$\n$$ d_A = 45 \\cdot \\frac{3}{5} $$\n$$ d_A = 9 \\cdot 3 $$\n$$ d_A = 27 $$\nThen $d_B = \\frac{2}{3}d_A = \\frac{2}{3}(27) = 2(9) = 18$.\nWe can check that $d_A + d_B = 27 + 18 = 45$, which is the distance between the two cities.\n\nThe distance from City $A$ where they meet is $d_A = 27$ miles.\n\nFinal Answer: The final answer is $\\boxed{27}$"], "id": 0, "generated_answers": ["27"], "gold_answer": "27.0", "is_correct": true, "answers_correctness": [true]}
