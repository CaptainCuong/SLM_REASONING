{"question": "Take the total energy (potential plus thermal) of the Sun to be given by the simple expression:\n\\[\nE \\simeq-\\frac{G M^{2}}{R}\n\\]\nwhere $M$ and $R$ are the mass and radius, respectively.

Assume that the total energy of the Sun is always given by the above expression, even as $R$ gets smaller. By writing down a simple (differential) equation relating the power radiated at Sun's surface with the change in its total energy (using the above expression), integrate this equation to find the time (in years) for the Sun to shrink to $1 / 2$ its present radius.

{"question": "Buzz, the hot new dining spot on campus, emphasizes simplicity. It only has two items on the menu, burgers and zucchini. Customers make a choice as they enter (they are not allowed to order both), and inform the cooks in the back room by shouting out either \"B\" or \"Z\". Unfortunately the two letters sound similar so $8 \\%$ of the time the cooks misinterpret what was said. The marketing experts who designed the restaurant guess that $90 \\%$ of the orders will be for burgers and $10 \\%$ for zucchini.\nThe cooks can hear one order per second. The customers arrive at the rate of one per second. One of the chefs says that this system will never work because customers can only send one bit per second, the rate at which orders can be accepted, so you could barely keep up even if there were no noise in the channel. You are hired as an outside consultant to deal with the problem.\nWhat is the channel capacity $\\mathrm{C}$ of this communication channel in bits per second?", "generated_responses": ["Let $B$ be the event that a customer orders a burger, and $Z$ be the event that a customer orders a zucchini. We are given that $P(B) = 0.9$ and $P(Z) = 0.1$. The probability that the cook misinterprets the order is $0.08$. Let $B'$ be the event that the cook interprets the order as a burger, and $Z'$ be the event that the cook interprets the order as a zucchini. We are given that $P(B' | B) = 0.92$ and $P(Z' | Z) = 0.92$. Also, $P(B' | Z) = 0.08$ and $P(Z' | B) = 0.08$.\nWe want to find the channel capacity $C$ of this communication channel in bits per second.\nThe channel capacity is given by the maximum mutual information between the input and output of the channel.\nLet $X$ be the input (the order the customer makes) and $Y$ be the output (the order the cook interprets). We want to find $C = \\max_{p(x)} I(X;Y)$, where $I(X;Y) = H(Y) - H(Y|X)$.\nWe have $H(Y|X) = P(B) H(Y|B) + P(Z) H(Y|Z)$.\n$H(Y|B) = -P(B' | B) \\log_2 P(B' | B) - P(Z' | B) \\log_2 P(Z' | B) = -0.92 \\log_2 0.92 - 0.08 \\log_2 0.08 \\approx 0.499$.\n$H(Y|Z) = -P(B' | Z) \\log_2 P(B' | Z) - P(Z' | Z) \\log_2 P(Z' | Z) = -0.08 \\log_2 0.08 - 0.92 \\log_2 0.92 \\approx 0.499$.\nSo $H(Y|X) = 0.9 \\times 0.499 + 0.1 \\times 0.499 = 0.499$.\nNow we need to find $H(Y)$. We have $P(B') = P(B') P(B) + P(B') P(Z) = 0.92 \\times 0.9 + 0.08 \\times 0.1 = 0.828 + 0.008 = 0.836$.\n$P(Z') = P(Z') P(B) + P(Z') P(Z) = 0.08 \\times 0.9 + 0.92 \\times 0.1 = 0.072 + 0.092 = 0.164$.\n$H(Y) = -P(B') \\log_2 P(B') - P(Z') \\log_2 P(Z') = -0.836 \\log_2 0.836 - 0.164 \\log_2 0.164 \\approx 0.595$.\nThen $I(X;Y) = H(Y) - H(Y|X) = 0.595 - 0.499 = 0.096$.\nThe channel capacity is the maximum mutual information, which is $0.096$ bits per second.\n\nHowever, the problem states that the cooks can hear one order per second, and the customers arrive at the rate of one per second. This means that the channel capacity is 1 bit per second. The problem is asking for the channel capacity in bits per second.\nThe channel capacity is the maximum rate at which information can be transmitted through the channel. In this case, the channel capacity is 1 bit per second, since the cooks can hear one order per second and the customers arrive at the rate of one per second.\nThe channel capacity is given by the maximum mutual information between the input and output of the channel. In this case, the input is the order the customer makes, and the output is the order the cook interprets.\nThe channel capacity is 1 bit per second, since the cooks can hear one order per second and the customers arrive at the rate of one per second.\n\nFinal Answer: The final answer is $\\boxed{1}$"], "generated_answers": ["1"], "gold_answer": "0.5978", "is_correct": false, "answers_correctness": [false]}

To convert this to minutes:\n1. Convert years to days: \\(200,000 \\text{ years} \\times 365.25 \\text{ days/year} = 73,050,000 \\text{ days}\\)\n2. Convert days to hours: \\(73,050,000 \\text{ days} \\times 24 \\text{ hours/day} = 1,753,200,000 \\text{ hours}\\)\n3.

{"question": "Determine the minimum potential in V (to 2 decimal places) that must be applied to an $\\alpha$-particle so that on interaction with a hydrogen atom, a ground state electron will be excited to $n$ $=6$.", "generated_responses": ["Let $V$ be the potential applied to the $\\alpha$-particle.

The volume of the unit cell is $V = a^3$.\nThe mass of the unit cell is the mass of 2 iron atoms, which is $2 \\times 55.845 \\mathrm{~g} = 111.69 \\mathrm{~g}$.\nThe density of iron is $\\rho = 7.86 \\mathrm{~g} / \\mathrm{cm}^3$.\nThe mass of the unit cell is also given by $\\rho V = \\rho a^3$.\nTherefore, $111.69 = 7.86 a^3$, so $a^3 = \\frac{111.69}{7.86} = 14.22$.\nThen $a = \\sqrt[3]{14.22}

This means that the measured decay rate is $R = 15.3 \\pm 0.1$.\n\nWe want to find the maximum age of a sample that can be dated. This means we want to find the maximum value of $t$ such that the decay rate is still within the measurement error. In other words, we want to find the maximum value of $t$ such that $15.2 \\le R \\le 15.4$.\n\nWe have $R = R_0 e^{-\\lambda t}$, so $e^{-\\lambda t} = \\frac{R}{R_0}$. Taking the natural logarithm of both sides, we get $-\\lambda t = \\ln \\frac{R}{R_0}$, so $t = -\\frac{1}{\\lambda} \\ln \\frac{R}{R_0}$.\n\nWe want to find the maximum value of $t$, so we want to find the minimum value of $\\frac{R}{R_0}$. The minimum value of $R$ is $15.2$, so we have\n$$t_{\\text{max}} = -\\frac{1}{\\lambda} \\ln \\frac{15.2}{15.3} = -\\frac{1}{1.21 \\times 10^{-4}} \\ln \\frac{15.2}{15.3} \\approx -\\frac{1}{1.21 \\times 10^{-4}} \\ln 0.993457944 \\approx -\\frac{1}{1.21 \\times 10^{-4}} (-0.00655) \\approx \\frac{0.00655}{1.21 \\times 10^{-4}} \\approx 54.13 \\text{ years}.$$\nHowever, this is the maximum age for which the decay rate is still within the measurement error. We want to find the maximum age of a sample that can be dated, which means we want to find the age at which the decay rate is still measurable.\n\nWe want to find the maximum age $t$ such that the decay rate is still within the measurement error. This means that the decay rate is still distinguishable from zero. The decay rate is $R = R_0 e^{-\\lambda t}$. We want to find the maximum value of $t$ such that $R > 0$. Since $R_0 > 0$ and $\\lambda > 0$, we have $R > 0$ for all $t$. However, we want to find the maximum age such that the decay rate is still measurable.\n\nWe are given that the decay rate can be measured to $\\pm 0.1$ disintegrations per minute per gram of carbon.

The profit function is given by $P(q) = R(q) - C(q)$, where $R(q)$ is the revenue function and $C(q)$ is the cost function. In the short-term, the capital is fixed, so the cost function is $C(q) = FC + VC(q)$, where $FC$ is the fixed cost and $VC(q)$ is the variable cost. The revenue function is $R(q) = pq$, where $p$ is the price per unit.\n\nTo maximize profits, we need to find the output level $q$ such that the first derivative of the profit function with respect to $q$ is equal to zero, and the second derivative is negative.

Thus, we are interested in the first eigenvalue $E_1^{(0)} = 10$.\nThe first-order correction to the energy is\n\\[\nE_1^{(1)} = \\langle \\mathbf{v}_1^{(0)} | \\mathbf{A}^{(1)} | \\mathbf{v}_1^{(0)} \\rangle = \\left(\\begin{array}{c} 1 \\\\ 0 \\\\ 0 \\end{array}\\right)^T \\left(\\begin{array}{ccc}\n0 & 1 & 0 \\\\\n1 & 0 & 2 \\\\\n0 & 2 & 0\n\\end{array}\\right) \\left(\\begin{array}{c} 1 \\\\ 0 \\\\ 0 \\end{array}\\right) = 0\n\\]\nThe second-order correction to the energy is\n\\[\nE_1^{(2)} = \\sum_{n \\neq 1} \\frac{|\\langle \\mathbf{v}_n^{(0)} | \\mathbf{A}^{(1)} | \\mathbf{v}_1^{(0)} \\rangle|^2}{E_1^{(0)} - E_n^{(0)}} = \\frac{|\\langle \\mathbf{v}_2^{(0)} | \\mathbf{A}^{(1)} | \\mathbf{v}_1^{(0)} \\rangle|^2}{E_1^{(0)} - E_2^{(0)}} + \\frac{|\\langle \\mathbf{v}_3^{(0)} | \\mathbf{A}^{(1)} | \\mathbf{v}_1^{(0)} \\rangle|^2}{E_1^{(0)} - E_3^{(0)}}\n\\]\nWe have\n\\[\n\\langle \\mathbf{v}_2^{(0)} | \\mathbf{A}^{(1)} | \\mathbf{v}_1^{(0)} \\rangle = \\left(\\begin{array}{c} 0 \\\\ 1 \\\\ 0 \\end{array}\\right)^T \\left(\\begin{array}{ccc}\n0 & 1 & 0 \\\\\n1 & 0 & 2 \\\\\n0 & 2 & 0\n\\end{array}\\right) \\left(\\begin{array}{c} 1 \\\\ 0 \\\\ 0 \\end{array}\\right) = 1\n\\]\nand\n\\[\n\\langle \\mathbf{v}_3^{(0)} | \\mathbf{A}^{(1)} | \\mathbf{v}_1^{(0)} \\rangle = \\left(\\begin{array}{c} 0 \\\\ 0 \\\\ 1 \\end{array}\\right)^T \\left(\\begin{array}{ccc}\n0 & 1 & 0 \\\\\n1 & 0 & 2 \\\\\n0 & 2 & 0\n\\end{array}\\right) \\left(\\begin{array}{c} 1 \\\\ 0 \\\\ 0 \\end{array}\\right) = 0\n\\]\nThus,\n\\[\nE_1^{(2)} = \\frac{|1|^2}{10 - 0} + \\frac{|0|^2}{10 - (-10)} = \\frac{1}{10} + 0 = \\frac{1}{10} = 0.1\n\\]\nThe total energy is $E_1 = E_1^{(0)} + E_1^{(1)} + E_1^{(2)} = 10 + 0 + 0.1 = 10.1$.\n\nFinal Answer: The final answer is $\\boxed{10.1}$"], "generated_answers": ["10.1"], "gold_answer": "10.1", "is_correct": true, "answers_correctness": [true]}
