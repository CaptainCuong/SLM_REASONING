The denominator is:\n\\[\n(e^x - 1)(x - 2)\n\\]\nThis expression is zero when:\n\\[\ne^x - 1 = 0 \\quad \\text{or} \\quad x - 2 = 0\n\\]\nSolving these equations:\n\\[\ne^x - 1 = 0 \\implies e^x = 1 \\implies x = 0\n\\]\n\\[\nx - 2 = 0 \\implies x = 2\n\\]\nThus, the function is undefined at \\( x = 0 \\) and \\( x = 2 \\).\n\n### Step 2: Analyze the behavior of the function at \\( x = 0 \\)\nWe need to check if \\( x = 0 \\) is a second-class discontinuity. A second-class discontinuity occurs if the limit of the function as \\( x \\) approaches the point does not exist or is infinite.\n\nConsider the limit as \\( x \\to 0 \\):\n\\[\n\\lim_{x \\to 0} f(x) = \\lim_{x \\to 0} \\frac{e^{\\frac{1}{x-1}} \\ln|1+x|}{(e^x-1)(x-2)}\n\\]\nAs \\( x \\to 0 \\):\n- \\( e^{\\frac{1}{x-1}} \\to e^{-\\infty} = 0 \\)\n- \\( \\ln|1+x| \\to \\ln 1 = 0 \\)\n- \\( e^x - 1 \\to 0 \\)\n- \\( x - 2 \\to -2 \\)\n\nThus, the numerator approaches 0, and the denominator approaches 0.

Let's identify these points:\n\n1. **Denominator is zero:**\n   \\[\n   (e^x - 1)(x - 2) = 0\n   \\]\n   This gives us two solutions:\n   \\[\n   e^x - 1 = 0 \\implies e^x = 1 \\implies x = 0\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   x - 2 = 0 \\implies x = 2\n   \\]\n\n2. **Argument of the logarithm is non-positive:**\n   \\[\n   |1 + x| > 0 \\implies 1 + x > 0 \\implies x > -1\n   \\]\n   This condition is always satisfied for \\( x > -1 \\).\n\n### Step 2: Check the behavior of the function at the points \\( x = 0 \\) and \\( x = 2 \\)\nWe need to determine if these points are second-class discontinuities. A second-class discontinuity occurs if the function has a vertical asymptote or if the limit does not exist.\n\n#### At \\( x = 0 \\):\n- The function \\( f(x) \\) is not defined at \\( x = 0 \\).\n- We need to check the limit as \\( x \\) approaches 0:\n  \\[\n  \\lim_{x \\to 0} f(x) = \\lim_{x \\to 0} \\frac{e^{\\frac{1}{x-1}} \\ln|1+x|}{(e^x-1)(x-2)}\n  \\]\n  As \\( x \\to 0 \\):\n  \\[\n  e^{\\frac{1}{x-1}} \\to e^{-\\infty} = 0\n  \\]\n  \\[\n  \\ln|1+x| \\to \\ln 1 = 0\n  \\]\n  \\[\n  e^x - 1 \\to 0\n  \\]\n  \\[\n  x - 2 \\to -2\n  \\]\n  The limit is of the form \\( \\frac{0}{0} \\). We can use L'Hôpital's rule to evaluate this limit. However, the numerator and denominator both approach zero, and the limit does not provide a clear indication of a vertical asymptote or a non-existent limit. Therefore, \\( x = 0 \\) is not a second-class discontinuity.\n\n#### At \\( x = 2 \\):\n- The function \\( f(x) \\) is not defined at \\( x = 2 \\).\n- We need to check the limit as \\( x \\) approaches 2:\n  \\[\n  \\lim_{x \\to 2} f(x) = \\lim_{x \\to 2} \\frac{e^{\\frac{1}{x-1}} \\ln|1+x|}{(e^x-1)(x-2)}\n  \\]\n  As \\( x \\to 2 \\):\n  \\[\n  e^{\\frac{1}{x-1}} \\to e^{\\infty} = \\infty\n  \\]\n  \\[\n  \\ln|1+x| \\to \\ln 3\n  \\]\n  \\[\n  e^x - 1 \\to e^2 - 1\n  \\]\n  \\[\n  x - 2 \\to 0\n  \\]\n  The limit is of the form \\( \\frac{\\infty}{0} \\), which indicates a vertical asymptote. Therefore, \\( x = 2 \\) is a second-class discontinuity.\n\n### Step 3: Check for other potential second-class discontinuities\nWe need to check if there are any other points where the function is not defined and the limit does not exist. The only other point is \\( x = 1 \\), where the argument of the logarithm is zero, making the function undefined. However, the limit as \\( x \\) approaches 1 does not provide a clear indication of a vertical asymptote or a non-existent limit. Therefore, \\( x = 1 \\) is not a second-class discontinuity.\n\n### Conclusion\nThe only second-class discontinuity is at \\( x = 2 \\).\n\nThus, the number of second-class discontinuities is \\(\\boxed{1}\\)."], "id": 105, "source": "QA_2020考研数3", "generated_answers": ["1"], "gold_answer": "C", "is_correct": false, "answers_correctness": [false]}

Let $A_{ij}$ be the cofactor of $a_{ij}$. We are given that the sum of the elements in each row of $A$ is 2, i.e., $a_{i1} + a_{i2} + a_{i3} = 2$ for $i=1,2,3$. Also, $|A| = 3$.\nWe want to find $A_{11} + A_{21} + A_{31}$.\nWe know that $A_{ij}$ is the cofactor of $a_{ij}$, which is $(-1)^{i+j} M_{ij}$, where $M_{ij}$ is the minor of $a_{ij}$.\nWe have\n$$ A_{11} + A_{21} + A_{31} = (-1)^{1+1} M_{11} + (-1)^{2+1} M_{21} + (-1)^{3+1} M_{31} = M_{11} -

a_{i1} = 2 + 2 - a_{i1} = 4 - a_{i1}$.\nWe have $|B| = \\begin{vmatrix} 2 & a_{12} & a_{13} \\\\ 2 & a_{22} & a_{23} \\\\ 2 & a_{32} & a_{33} \\end{vmatrix} = 2 \\begin{vmatrix} a_{12} & a_{13} \\\\ a_{22} & a_{23} \\\\ a_{32} & a_{33} \\end{vmatrix} -
