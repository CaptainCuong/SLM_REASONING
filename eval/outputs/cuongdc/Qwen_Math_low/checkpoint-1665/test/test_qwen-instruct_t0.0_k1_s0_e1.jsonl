{"question": "If $f(x)$ is a polynomial of degree 7, and $g(x)$ is a polynomial of degree 7, then what is the product of the minimum and the maximum possible degrees of $f(x) + g(x)$?", "generated_responses": ["Let $f(x)$ be a polynomial of degree 7, and $g(x)$ be a polynomial of degree 7.\nThe degree of $f(x) + g(x)$ is the maximum of the degrees of $f(x)$ and $g(x)$, unless the leading coefficients of $f(x)$ and $g(x)$ are opposite in sign and equal in magnitude, in which case the degree of $f(x) + g(x)$ is less than the maximum of the degrees of $f(x)$ and $g(x)$.\n\nThe maximum possible degree of $f(x) + g(x)$ occurs when the leading coefficients of $f(x)$ and $g(x)$ are not opposite in sign and equal in magnitude. In this case, the degree of $f(x) + g(x)$ is $\\max(\\deg(f(x)), \\deg(g(x))) = \\max(7, 7) = 7$.\n\nThe minimum possible degree of $f(x) + g(x)$ occurs when the leading coefficients of $f(x)$ and $g(x)$ are opposite in sign and equal in magnitude. In this case, the degree of $f(x) + g(x)$ is less than 7. The minimum possible degree is 0, which occurs when $f(x) = -g(x)$, so $f(x) + g(x) = 0$.\n\nHowever, we are given that $f(x)$ and $g(x)$ are polynomials of degree 7. This means that the leading coefficients of $f(x)$ and $g(x)$ are non-zero.\nIf the leading coefficients of $f(x)$ and $g(x)$ are opposite in sign and equal in magnitude, then the degree of $f(x) + g(x)$ is less than 7. The minimum possible degree is 0, which occurs when $f(x) = -g(x)$, so $f(x) + g(x) = 0$.\nIf the leading coefficients of $f(x)$ and $g(x)$ are not opposite in sign and equal in magnitude, then the degree of $f(x) + g(x)$ is 7.\n\nThe minimum possible degree of $f(x) + g(x)$ is 0, which occurs when $f(x) = -g(x)$.\nThe maximum possible degree of $f(x) + g(x)$ is 7, which occurs when the leading coefficients of $f(x)$ and $g(x)$ are not opposite in sign and equal in magnitude.\n\nThe product of the minimum and maximum possible degrees of $f(x) + g(x)$ is $0 \\times 7 = 0$.\n\nFinal Answer: The final answer is $\\boxed{0}$"], "id": "1", "generated_answers": ["0"], "gold_answer": "0", "is_correct": true, "answers_correctness": [true]}
