What is $m+n$?", "generated_responses": ["Let $N$ be the number of vertices of the regular icosahedron. Since it is a regular polyhedron made up of 20 equilateral triangles, it has 12 vertices.\nThe number of ways to choose three distinct vertices $Q, R, S$ from the 12 vertices is $\\binom{12}{3} = \\frac{12 \\times 11 \\times 10}{3 \\times 2 \\times 1} = 220$.\nWe want to find the probability that $d(Q, R) > d(R, S)$.\nSince the icosahedron is symmetric, the probability that $d(Q, R) > d(R, S)$ is the same as the probability that $d(Q, R) < d(R, S)$.\nAlso, the probability that $d(Q, R) = d(R, S)$ is not 0.\nLet $P(d(Q, R) > d(R, S)) = p$. Then $P(d(Q, R) < d(R, S)) = p$.\nAlso, $P(d(Q, R) = d(R, S)) = 1 - 2p$.\nSince the icosahedron is symmetric, we have $P(d(Q, R) > d(R, S)) = P(d(Q, R) < d(R, S))$.\nThus, $p = P(d(Q, R) > d(R, S))$.\nThe total number of ways to choose three distinct vertices is $\\binom{12}{3} = 220$.\nLet $N_{>}$ be the number of triples $(Q, R, S)$ such that $d(Q, R) > d(R, S)$.\nLet $N_{<}$ be the number of triples $(Q, R, S)$ such that $d(Q, R) < d(R, S)$.\nLet $N_{=}$ be the number of triples $(Q, R, S)$ such that $d(Q, R) = d(R, S)$.\nThen $N_{>} + N_{<} + N_{=} = \\binom{12}{3} = 220$.\nSince the icosahedron is symmetric, $N_{>} = N_{<}$.\nThus, $2N_{>} + N_{=} = 220$, so $N_{>} = \\frac{220 - N_{=}}{2}$.\nThe probability that $d(Q, R) > d(R, S)$ is $\\frac{N_{>}}{\\binom{12}{3}} = \\frac{N_{>}}{220}$.\nSince $N_{>} = N_{<}$, we have $P(d(Q, R) > d(R, S)) = P(d(Q, R) < d(R, S))$.\nAlso, $P(d(Q, R) > d(R, S)) + P(d(Q, R) < d(R, S)) + P(d(Q, R) = d(R, S)) = 1$.\nSo $2P(d(Q, R) > d(R, S)) + P(d(Q, R) = d(R, S)) = 1$.\nLet $p = P(d(Q, R) > d(R, S))$. Then $2p + P(d(Q, R) = d(R, S)) = 1$.\nSince $P(d(Q, R) = d(R, S)) > 0$, we have $2p < 1$, so $p < \\frac{1}{2}$.\nThe probability that $d(Q, R) > d(R, S)$ is $\\frac{1}{2} \\left( 1 - P(d(Q, R) = d(R, S)) \\right)$.\nThe probability that $d(Q, R) = d(R, S)$ is not 0.\nIf $Q, R, S$ are vertices of a triangle, then $d(Q, R) = d(R, S) = 1$.\nThe number of triangles in the icosahedron is 20.\nThe number of ways to choose three vertices that form a triangle is 20.\nThe probability that $Q, R, S$ form a triangle is $\\frac{20}{\\binom{12}{3}} = \\frac{20}{220} = \\frac{1}{11}$.\nIf $Q, R, S$ are not vertices of a triangle, then $d(Q, R) \\neq d(R, S)$.\nThe probability that $d(Q, R) > d(R, S)$ is $\\frac{1}{2} \\left( 1 -

The number of elements in this set is $12 - k$.\nWe need to choose $k-1$ elements from the set $\\{k+1, k+2, \\dots, 12\\}$. The number of ways to do this is $\\binom{12-k}{k-1}$.\nWe need to find the values of $k$ such that $k-1 \\le 12-k$, which means $2k \\le 13$, so $k \\le \\frac{13}{2} = 6.5$. Since $k$ is an integer, we have $k \\in \\{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6\\}$.\nFor each $k \\in \\{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6\\}$, we have $\\binom{12-k}{k-1}$ subsets $B$ such that $\\min(B) = k$ and $|B| = k$.\nThus, the total number of such subsets is\n$$ \\sum_{k=1}^6 \\binom{12-k}{k-1} = \\binom{11}{0} + \\binom{10}{1} + \\binom{9}{2} + \\binom{8}{3} + \\binom{7}{4} + \\binom{6}{5} $$\n$$ = 1 + 10 + \\frac{9 \\cdot 8}{2} + \\frac{8 \\cdot 7 \\cdot 6}{3 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 1} + \\frac{7 \\cdot 6 \\cdot 5}{4 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 1} + 6 $$\n$$ = 1 + 10 + 36 + 56 + 35 + 6 = 144 $$\nTherefore, the number of nonempty subsets $B$ of $\\{0, 1, 2, \\dots, 12\\}$ such that $|B| = \\min(B)$ is 144.\n\nFinal Answer: The final answer is $\\boxed{144}$"], "id": 48, "generated_answers": ["144"], "gold_answer": "144.0", "is_correct": true, "answers_correctness": [true]}
