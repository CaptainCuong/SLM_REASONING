{"question": "Xenia and Sergey play the following game. Xenia thinks of a positive integer $N$ not exceeding 5000. Then she fixes 20 distinct positive integers $a_{1}, a_{2}, \\ldots, a_{20}$ such that, for each $k=1,2, \\ldots, 20$, the numbers $N$ and $a_{k}$ are congruent modulo $k$. By a move, Sergey tells Xenia a set $S$ of positive integers not exceeding 20 , and she tells him back the set $\\left\\{a_{k}: k \\in S\\right\\}$ without spelling out which number corresponds to which index.

For example, $n = a+b$ where $a, b \\in A_1$ and $a \\neq b$.\n\nIf $k=2$, we can partition the positive integers into even and odd numbers.

$\\frac{a}{10^j}$ for any integers $a$ and $j$.\nSince $\\frac{10^k-1}{c \\cdot m}$ is not short, we have that $10^k-1$ is not divisible by $c \\cdot m$.\n\nWe want to find the maximum number of

Show that this number $\\ell(C)$ is finite, and determine its average value over all $2^{n}$ possible initial configurations $C$.", "generated_responses": ["Let $C$ be a configuration of $n$ coins, where each coin is either heads (H) or tails (T). We define $\\ell(C)$ as the number of steps needed to reach a configuration where all coins are tails (T). We want to show that $\\ell(C)$ is finite for any initial configuration $C$, and find the average value of $\\ell(C)$ over all $2^n$ possible initial configurations.\n\nFirst, we show that $\\ell(C)$ is finite. Let $k$ be the number of heads in the initial configuration $C$. If $k=0$, then $\\ell(C)=0$. If $k>0$, then we flip the $k$-th coin. If the $k$-th coin is heads, it becomes tails, so the number of heads decreases by 1. If the $k$-th coin is tails, it becomes heads, so the number of heads increases by 1. In either case, the number of heads changes by at most 1. Since the number of heads is always between 0 and $n$, the process must eventually reach a configuration with 0 heads, which is all tails. Thus, $\\ell(C)$ is finite.\n\nNow, we want to find the average value of $\\ell(C)$ over all $2^n$ possible initial configurations. Let $E$ be the expected value of $\\ell(C)$. We can write $E$ as\n$$E = \\frac{1}{2^n} \\sum_{C} \\ell(C)$$\nwhere the sum is over all $2^n$ possible initial configurations $C$.\n\nLet $C$ be a configuration with $k$ heads. Then $\\ell(C)$ is the number of steps needed to reach a configuration with 0 heads. We can think of this as a random walk on the integers from 0 to $n$, where we start at $k$ and move to $k-1$ with probability $\\frac{k}{n}$ and to $k+1$ with probability $\\frac{n-k}{n}$. We want to find the expected number of steps to reach 0.\n\nLet $E_k$ be the expected number of steps to reach 0 starting from $k$. Then we have the recurrence relation\n$$E_k = 1 + \\frac{k}{n} E_{k-1} + \\frac{n-k}{n} E_{k+1}$$\nfor $1 \\le k \\le n-1$, with $E_0 = 0$ and $E_n = 1 + \\frac{n}{n} E_{n-1} + \\frac{0}{n} E_{n+1} = 1 + E_{n-1}$.\n\nWe can solve this recurrence relation by assuming $E_k = c k (n-k)$ for some constant $c$.

{"question": "We are given an infinite deck of cards, each with a real number on it. For every real number $x$, there is exactly one card in the deck that has $x$ written on it.

This rule should satisfy the following conditions:\n\n1. The winner only depends on the relative order of the 200 cards: if the cards are laid down in increasing order face down and we are told which card belongs to which player, but not what numbers are written on them, we can still decide the winner.\n2.

Then $n$ has three distinct positive divisors $d_1, d_2, d_3$ such that $d_1 + d_2 + d_3 = 2022$.\nSince $d_1, d_2, d_3$ are distinct positive divisors of $n$, we must have $1 \\le d_1 < d_2 < d_3$.\nSince $d_1, d_2, d_3$ are divisors of $n$, we have $d_1 \\mid n$, $d_2 \\mid n$, $d_3 \\mid n$.\nSince $d_1, d_2, d_3$ are distinct, we must have $d_1 \\neq d_2 \\neq d_3$.\nWe want to find the smallest Norwegian number $n$.\nIf $n$ is a prime number, then its divisors are 1 and $n$. We need $1 + n + d_3 = 2022$, so $n + d_3 = 2021$. Since $n$ is prime, $d_3$ must be a divisor of $n$, so $d_3 = 1$ or $d_3 = n$. But $d_3 > n$, so this is impossible.\nIf $n$ is a perfect square, say $n = p^2$ for some prime $p$, then the divisors of $n$ are 1, $p$, and $p^2$. We need $1 + p + p^2 = 2022$, so $p^2 + p - 2021 = 0$. The roots of this quadratic are $p = \\frac{-1 \\pm \\sqrt{1 - 4(-2021)}}{2} = \\frac{-1 \\pm \\sqrt{8085}}{2}$.

Since the rectangles are formed by cutting the square, the total perimeter of the rectangles is $4m + 2 \\times (\\text{number of cuts})$.\nThe number of cuts is $5-1 = 4$.\nThus, $2 \\sum_{i=1}^5 (a_i + b_i) = 4m + 2(4) = 4m + 8$.\nSo, $\\sum_{i=1}^5 (a_i + b_i) = 2m + 4$.\nSince $a_i, b_i \\in S$, we have $\\sum_{i=1}^5 a_i + \\sum_{i=1}^5 b_i = 2m + 4$.\nAlso, $\\sum_{i=1}^5 a_i + \\sum_{i=1}^5 b_i \\le 2 \\sum_{i=1}^{10} i = 2(55) = 110$.\nSince $\\sum_{i=1}^5 a_i + \\sum_{i=1}^5 b_i = 2m + 4$, we have $2m + 4 \\le 110$, so $2m \\le 106$, which means $m \\le 53$.\nAlso, $\\sum_{i=1}^5 a_i + \\sum_{i=1}^5 b_i \\ge 2 \\sum_{i=1}^5 i = 2(1+2+3+4+5) = 30$.\nSo $2m + 4 \\ge 30$, which means $2m \\ge 26$, so $m \\ge 13$.\nThus, $13 \\le m \\le 53$.\n\nWe need to find the possible values of $m$ such that $m^2$ can be written as the sum of the areas of five rectangles with side lengths in $S$.\nWe have $m^2 = \\sum_{i=1}^5 a_i b_i$.\nWe also have $\\sum_{i=1}^5 (a_i + b_i) = 2m + 4$.\nWe need to find $m$ such that $m^2$ can be written as the sum of the areas of five rectangles with side lengths in $S$.\nWe can try $m=15$. Then $m^2 = 225$.\nWe need to find five pairs of integers in $S$ such that their product sums to 225.\nWe can try $1 \\times 10 = 10$, $2 \\times 9 = 18$, $3 \\times 8 = 24$, $4 \\times 7 = 28$, $5 \\times 6 = 30$.\nThen $10 + 18 + 24 + 28 + 30 = 110 \\neq 225$.\nWe can try $1 \\times 10 = 10$, $2 \\times 9 = 18$, $3 \\times 8 = 24$, $4 \\times 7 = 28$, $5 \\times 5 = 25$.\nThen $10 + 18 + 24 + 28 + 25 = 105 \\neq 225$.\nWe can try $1 \\times 10 = 10$, $2 \\times 9 = 18$, $3 \\times 8 = 24$, $4 \\times 6 = 24$, $5 \\times 7 = 35$.\nThen $10 + 18 + 24 + 24 + 35 = 111 \\neq 225$.\nWe can try $1 \\times 10 = 10$, $2 \\times 9 = 18$, $3 \\times 7 = 21$, $4 \\times 6 = 24$, $5 \\times 8 = 40$.\nThen $10 + 18 + 21 + 24 + 40 = 113 \\neq 225$.\nWe can try $1 \\times 10 = 10$, $2 \\times 9 = 18$, $3 \\times 6 = 18$, $4 \\times 5 = 20$, $7 \\times 8 = 56$.\nThen $10 + 18 + 18 + 20 + 56 = 122 \\neq 225$.\nWe can try $1 \\times 10 = 10$, $2 \\times 9 = 18$, $3 \\times 5 = 15$, $4 \\times 4 = 16$, $6 \\times 7 = 42$.\nThen $10 + 18 + 15 + 16 + 42 = 91 \\neq 225$.\nWe can try $1 \\times 10 = 10$, $2 \\times 9 = 18$, $3 \\times 4 = 12$, $5 \\times 6 = 30$, $7 \\times 8 = 56$.\nThen $10 + 18 + 12 + 30 + 56 = 126 \\neq 225$.\nWe can try $1 \\times 10 = 10$, $2 \\times 9 = 18$, $3 \\times 3 = 9$, $4 \\times 5 = 20$, $6 \\times 7 = 42$.\nThen $10 + 18 + 9 + 20 + 42 = 100 \\neq 225$.\nWe can try $1 \\times 10 = 10$, $2 \\times 9 = 18$, $3 \\times 2 = 6$, $4 \\times 5 = 20$, $7 \\times 8 = 56$.\nThen $10 + 18 + 6 + 20 + 56 = 110 \\neq 225$.\nWe can try $1 \\times 10 = 10$, $2 \\times 9 = 18$, $3 \\times 1 = 3$, $4 \\times 5 = 20$, $6 \\times 7 = 42$.\nThen $10 + 18 + 3 + 20 + 42 = 93 \\neq 225$.\n\nFinal Answer: The final answer is $\\boxed{15, 20, 25, 30, 35, 40, 45, 50, 55}$"], "id": 2216, "generated_answers": ["15, 20, 25, 30, 35, 40, 45, 50, 55"], "gold_answer": "11,13", "is_correct": false, "answers_correctness": [false]}

The possible values for $a$ are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. Then $b$ is 4, 3, 2, 1, 0. So $f(2) = 5$.\nFor $n=3$, we want to find the number of integers $abc$ such that $a+b+c=5$ and $a \\neq 0$. This is equivalent to finding the number of non-negative integer solutions to $a+b+c=5$ with $a \\geq 1$. Let $a' = a-1$, so $a' \\geq 0$. Then $a'+1+b+c=5$, so $a'+b+c=4$. The number of non-negative integer solutions to this equation is $\\binom{4+3-1}{3-1} = \\binom{6}{2} = 15$.

Let $k = 2m$, where $m$ is a positive integer.\nThen $2n = (2m-2)(2m+2) = 4(m-1)(m+1)$, so $n = 2(m-1)(m+1) = 2(m^2-1) = 2m^2-2$.\nWe are given that $n < 100000$, so $2m^2-2 < 100000$, which means $2m^2 < 100002$, so $m^2 < 50001$.\nSince $m$ is a positive integer, we have $m \\le \\sqrt{50001} \\approx 223.6$.\nThus, $m$ can take values from 1 to 223.\nHowever, we need $n$ to be a positive integer, so $2m^2-2 > 0$, which means $m^2 > 1$, so $m > 1$.\nThus, $m$ can take values from 2 to 223.\nThe number of possible values for $m$ is $223 - 2 + 1 = 222$.\nFor each value of $m$, we have $n = 2m^2-2$ and $BC = 2(n+1)\\sqrt{2n+4} = 2(2m^2-2+1)(2(2m^2-2)+4) = 2(2m^2-1)(4m^2-4+4) = 2(2m^2-1)(4m^2) = 4m^2(2m^2-1)$.\nSince $m$ is an integer, $BC$ is an integer.\nTherefore, the number of positive integers $n < 100000$ for which the length of side $BC$ is also an integer is 222.\n\nFinal Answer: The final answer is $\\boxed{222}$"], "id": 2409, "generated_answers": ["222"], "gold_answer": "222", "is_correct": true, "answers_correctness": [true]}

We want to find $a$ and $b$ such that $10a + b = 38$.\nWe can see that $a = 3$ and $b = 8$ satisfy this equation.\nThus, the year Charlie was born is $1938$.\nCharlie's age in 2014 is $2014 - 1938 = 76$.\nThe number formed by the rightmost two digits of the year in which he was born is $38$.\nWe have $76 = 2(38)$, which is true.\n\nFinal Answer: The final answer is $\\boxed{1938}$"], "id": 2598, "generated_answers": ["1938"], "gold_answer": "1938", "is_correct": true, "answers_correctness": [true]}

This means that there exists a positive integer $n$ such that $k + (n-1)k^2 = 306$.\nWe can rewrite this as $k + nk^2 - k^2 = 306$, so $nk^2 - k^2 + k = 306$, which gives $k^2(n-1) + k = 306$.\nWe can factor out $k$ to get $k(k(n-1) + 1) = 306$.\nSince $k$ is a positive integer, $k$ must be a divisor of 306.

{"question": "Compute the number of quadratic functions $f(x)=a x^{2}+b x+c$ with integer roots and integer coefficients whose graphs pass through the points $(0,0)$ and $(15,225)$.", "generated_responses": ["Let $f(x) = ax^2 + bx + c$ be a quadratic function with integer roots and integer coefficients. Since the graph of $f(x)$ passes through $(0,0)$, we have $f(0) = c = 0$. Thus, $f(x) = ax^2 + bx$.\nSince the graph of $f(x)$ passes through $(15,225)$, we have $f(15) = a(15^2) + b(15) = 225a + 15b = 225$.\nDividing by 15, we get $15a + b = 15$, so $b = 15 - 15a$.\nThus, $f(x) = ax^2 + (15-15a)x = ax^2 + 15x - 15ax = ax^2 - 15ax + 15x = ax(x-15) + 15x$.\nSince $f(x)$ has integer roots, let the roots be $r_1$ and $r_2$. Then $f(x) = a(x-r_1)(x-r_2) = a(x^2 - (r_1+r_2)x + r_1 r_2) = ax^2 - a(r_1+r_2)x + ar_1 r_2$.\nComparing this with $f(x) = ax^2 + bx$, we have $b = -a(r_1+r_2)$ and $0 = ar_1 r_2$.\nSince $a$ is an integer, we must have $r_1 r_2 = 0$. Thus, either $r_1 = 0$ or $r_2 = 0$.\nIf $r_1 = 0$, then $b = -a(0+r_2) = -ar_2$. Since $b = 15-15a$, we have $-ar_2 = 15-15a$, so $ar_2 = 15a-15$.\nIf $a=0$, then $b=15$, so $f(x) = 15x$. The roots are $0$ and $0$, which are integers.\nIf $a \\neq 0$, then $r_2 = 15 - \\frac{15}{a}$. Since $r_2$ is an integer, $\\frac{15}{a}$ must be an integer, so $a$ must be a divisor of 15.\nThe divisors of 15 are $\\pm 1, \\pm 3, \\pm 5, \\pm 15$.\nIf $a=1$, then $r_2 = 15-15 = 0$. So $f(x) = x^2 + 15x - 15x = x^2$.\nIf $a=-1$, then $r_2 = 15-(-15) = 30$. So $f(x) = -x^2 + 15x - 15(-1)x = -x^2 + 30x$.\nIf $a=3$, then $r_2 = 15-\\frac{15}{3} = 15-5 = 10$. So $f(x) = 3x^2 + 15x - 15(3)x = 3x^2 - 30x$.\nIf $a=-3$, then $r_2 = 15-\\frac{15}{-3} = 15+5 = 20$. So $f(x) = -3x^2 + 15x - 15(-3)x = -3x^2 + 60x$.\nIf $a=5$, then $r_2 = 15-\\frac{15}{5} = 15-3 = 12$. So $f(x) = 5x^2 + 15x - 15(5)x = 5x^2 - 60x$.\nIf $a=-5$, then $r_2 = 15-\\frac{15}{-5} = 15+3 = 18$. So $f(x) = -5x^2 + 15x - 15(-5)x = -5x^2 + 90x$.\nIf $a=15$, then $r_2 = 15-\\frac{15}{15} = 15-1 = 14$. So $f(x) = 15x^2 + 15x - 15(15)x = 15x^2 - 210x$.\nIf $a=-15$, then $r_2 = 15-\\frac{15}{-15} = 15+1 = 16$. So $f(x) = -15x^2 + 15x - 15(-15)x = -15x^2 + 240x$.\nIf $r_2 = 0$, then $b = -a(0+r_1) = -ar_1$. Since $b = 15-15a$, we have $-ar_1 = 15-15a$, so $ar_1 = 15a-15$.\nIf $a=0$, then $b=15$, so $f(x) = 15x$. The roots are $0$ and $0$, which are integers.\nIf $a \\neq 0$, then $r_1 = 15 - \\frac{15}{a}$. Since $r_1$ is an integer, $\\frac{15}{a}$ must be an integer, so $a$ must be a divisor of 15.\nThe divisors of 15 are $\\pm 1, \\pm 3, \\pm 5, \\pm 15$.\nIf $a=1$, then $r_1 = 15-15 = 0$. So $f(x) = x^2 + 15x - 15x = x^2$.\nIf $a=-1$, then $r_1 = 15-(-15) = 30$. So $f(x) = -x^2 + 15x - 15(-1)x = -x^2 + 30x$.\nIf $a=3$, then $r_1 = 15-\\frac{15}{3} = 15-5 = 10$. So $f(x) = 3x^2 + 15x - 15(3)x = 3x^2 - 30x$.\nIf $a=-3$, then $r_1 = 15-\\frac{15}{-3} = 15+5 = 20$. So $f(x) = -3x^2 + 15x - 15(-3)x = -3x^2 + 60x$.\nIf $a=5$, then $r_1 = 15-\\frac{15}{5} = 15-3 = 12$. So $f(x) = 5x^2 + 15x - 15(5)x = 5x^2 - 60x$.\nIf $a=-5$, then $r_1 = 15-\\frac{15}{-5} = 15+3 = 18$. So $f(x) = -5x^2 + 15x - 15(-5)x = -5x^2 + 90x$.\nIf $a=15$, then $r_1 = 15-\\frac{15}{15} = 15-1 = 14$. So $f(x) = 15x^2 + 15x - 15(15)x = 15x^2 - 210x$.\nIf $a=-15$, then $r_1 = 15-\\frac{15}{-15} = 15+1 = 16$.

However, eighteen families arrive and are looking to move in. After much debate, the connotations of using negative house numbers are deemed unacceptable, and the city decides on an alternative plan. On July 17, Shewad Movers arrive and relocate every family from house $n$ to house $n+18$, for all positive $n$ (so that City Hall does not move). For example, the family in house number 17 moves to house number 35.\nRoss takes a walk starting at his house, which is number 34 . He first visits house $n_{1}$, such that $d\\left(n_{1}, 34\\right)=1 / 3$. He then goes to another house, $n_{2}$, such that $d\\left(n_{1}, n_{2}\\right)=1 / 3$. Continuing in that way, he visits houses $n_{3}, n_{4}, \\ldots$, and each time, $d\\left(n_{i}, n_{i+1}\\right)=1 / 3$. At the end of the day, what is his maximum possible distance from his original house? Justify your answer.", "generated_responses": ["Let $d(n)$ be the distance from house $n$ to City Hall.

{"question": "Positive integers $x, y, z$ satisfy $x y+z=160$. Compute the smallest possible value of $x+y z$.", "generated_responses": ["Let $x, y, z$ be positive integers such that $xy+z=160$. We want to find the smallest possible value of $x+yz$.\nWe have $x+yz = x + y(160-xy) = x + 160y - xy^2$.\nWe want to minimize $x+yz$ subject to $xy+z=160$.\nWe can write $z = 160-xy$. Then $x+yz = x+y(160-xy) = x+160y-xy^2$.\nWe want to minimize $x+160y-xy^2$.\nWe can rewrite this as $x(1-y^2) + 160y$.\nIf $y=1$, then $x+yz = x+z = x+(160-x) = 160$.\nIf $y=2$, then $x+yz = x+2(160-2x) = x+320-4x = 320-3x$.\nWe want to minimize $320-3x$, so we want to maximize $x$. Since $xy+z=160$, we have $2x+z=160$, so $z=160-2x$. Since $z$ is a positive integer, $160-2x>0$, so $2x<160$, which means $x<80$. Thus, the maximum value of $x$ is 79. Then $x+yz = 79+2(160-2(79)) = 79+2(160-158) = 79+2(2) = 79+4 = 83$.\nIf $y=3$, then $x+yz = x+3(160-3x) = x+480-9x = 480-8x$.\nWe want to minimize $480-8x$, so we want to maximize $x$. Since $xy+z=160$, we have $3x+z=160$, so $z=160-3x$. Since $z$ is a positive integer, $160-3x>0$, so $3x<160$, which means $x<\\frac{160}{3} = 53.33$. Thus, the maximum value of $x$ is 53. Then $x+yz = 53+3(160-3(53)) = 53+3(160-159) = 53+3(1) = 53+3 = 56$.\nIf $y=4$, then $x+yz = x+4(160-4x) = x+640-16x = 640-15x$.\nWe want to minimize $640-15x$, so we want to maximize $x$. Since $xy+z=160$, we have $4x+z=160$, so $z=160-4x$. Since $z$ is a positive integer, $160-4x>0$, so $4x<160$, which means $x<40$. Thus, the maximum value of $x$ is 39. Then $x+yz = 39+4(160-4(39)) = 39+4(160-156) = 39+4(4) = 39+16 = 55$.\nIf $y=5$, then $x+yz = x+5(160-5x) = x+800-25x = 800-24x$.\nWe want to minimize $800-24x$, so we want to maximize $x$. Since $xy+z=160$, we have $5x+z=160$, so $z=160-5x$. Since $z$ is a positive integer, $160-5x>0$, so $5x<160$, which means $x<32$. Thus, the maximum value of $x$ is 31. Then $x+yz = 31+5(160-5(31)) = 31+5(160-155) = 31+5(5) = 31+25 = 56$.\nIf $y=6$, then $x+yz = x+6(160-6x) = x+960-36x = 960-35x$.\nWe want to minimize $960-35x$, so we want to maximize $x$. Since $xy+z=160$, we have $6x+z=160$, so $z=160-6x$. Since $z$ is a positive integer, $160-6x>0$, so $6x<160$, which means $x<\\frac{160}{6} = \\frac{80}{3} = 26.66$. Thus, the maximum value of $x$ is 26. Then $x+yz = 26+6(160-6(26)) = 26+6(160-156) = 26+6(4) = 26+24 = 50$.\nIf $y=7$, then $x+yz = x+7(160-7x) = x+1120-49x = 1120-48x$.\nWe want to minimize $1120-48x$, so we want to maximize $x$. Since $xy+z=160$, we have $7x+z=160$, so $z=160-7x$. Since $z$ is a positive integer, $160-7x>0$, so $7x<160$, which means $x<\\frac{160}{7} = 22.85$. Thus, the maximum value of $x$ is 22. Then $x+yz = 22+7(160-7(22)) = 22+7(160-154) = 22+7(6) = 22+42 = 64$.\nIf $y=8$, then $x+yz = x+8(160-8x) = x+1280-64x = 1280-63x$.\nWe want to minimize $1280-63x$, so we want to maximize $x$. Since $xy+z=160$, we have $8x+z=160$, so $z=160-8x$. Since $z$ is a positive integer, $160-8x>0$, so $8x<160$, which means $x<20$. Thus, the maximum value of $x$ is 19. Then $x+yz = 19+8(160-8(19)) = 19+8(160-152) = 19+8(8) = 19+64 = 83$.\nIf $y=9$, then $x+yz = x+9(160-9x) = x+1440-81x = 1440-80x$.\nWe want to minimize $1440-80x$, so we want to maximize $x$. Since $xy+z=160$, we have $9x+z=160$, so $z=160-9x$. Since $z$ is a positive integer, $160-9x>0$, so $9x<160$, which means $x<\\frac{160}{9} = 17.77$. Thus, the maximum value of $x$ is 17. Then $x+yz = 17+9(160-9(17)) = 17+9(160-153) = 17+9(7) = 17+63 = 80$.\nIf $y=10$, then $x+yz = x+10(160-10x) = x+1600-100x = 1600-99x$.\nWe want to minimize $1600-99x$, so we want to maximize $x$. Since $xy+z=160$, we have $10x+z=160$, so $z=160-10x$. Since $z$ is a positive integer, $160-10x>0$, so $10x<160$, which means $x<16$. Thus, the maximum value of $x$ is 15. Then $x+yz = 15+10(160-10(15)) = 15+10(160-150) = 15+10(10) = 15+100 = 115$.\nIf $x=1$, then $y+z=159$. We want to minimize $1+yz$. Since $y+z=159$, we have $z=159-y$. Then $1+yz = 1+y(159-y) = 1+159y-y^2$.\nWe want to minimize $1+159y-y^2$. The vertex of the parabola $y^2-159y-1$ is at $y=\\frac{159}{2} = 79.5$. Since $y$ is an integer, we can try $y=79$ and $y=80$.\nIf $y=79$, then $z=159-79=80$. Then $1+yz = 1+79(80) = 1+6320 = 6321$.\nIf $y=80$, then $z=159-80=79$. Then $1+yz = 1+80(79) = 1+6320 = 6321$.\nIf $x=2$, then $2y+z=158$. We want to minimize $2+yz$. Since $2y+z=158$, we have $z=158-2y$. Then $2+yz = 2+y(158-2y) = 2+158y-2y^2$.\nWe want to minimize $2+158y-2y^2$. The vertex of the parabola $2y^2-158y-2$ is at $y=\\frac{158}{4} = 39.5$. Since $y$ is an integer, we can try $y=39$ and $y=40$.\nIf $y=39$, then $z=158-2(39)=158-78=80$. Then $2+yz = 2+39(80) = 2+3120 = 3122$.\nIf $y=40$, then $z=158-2(40)=158-80=78$. Then $2+yz = 2+40(78) = 2+3120 = 3122$.\nIf $x=3$, then $3y+z=157$. We want to minimize $3+yz$. Since $3y+z=157$, we have $z=157-3y$. Then $3+yz = 3+y(157-3y) = 3+157y-3y^2$.\nWe want to minimize $3+157y-3y^2$. The vertex of the parabola $3y^2-157y-3$ is at $y=\\frac{157}{6} = 26.16$. Since $y$ is an integer, we can try $y=26$ and $y=27$.\nIf $y=26$, then $z=157-3(26)=157-78=79$. Then $3+yz = 3+26(79) = 3+2054 = 2057$.\nIf $y=27$, then $z=157-3(27)=157-81=76$. Then $3+yz = 3+27(76) = 3+2052 = 2055$.\nIf $x=4$, then $4y+z=156$. We want to minimize $4+yz$. Since $4y+z=156$, we have $z=156-4y$. Then $4+yz = 4+y(156-4y) = 4+156y-4y^2$.\nWe want to minimize $4+156y-4y^2$. The vertex of the parabola $4y^2-156y-4$ is at $y=\\frac{156}{8} = 19.5$. Since $y$ is an integer, we can try $y=19$ and $y=20$.\nIf $y=19$, then $z=156-4(19)=156-76=80$. Then $4+yz = 4+19(80) = 4+1520 = 1524$.\nIf $y=20$, then $z=156-4(20)=156-80=76$. Then $4+yz = 4+20(76) = 4+1520 = 1524$.\nIf $x=5$, then $5y+z=155$. We want to minimize $5+yz$. Since $5y+z=155$, we have $z=155-5y$. Then $5+yz = 5+y(155-5y) = 5+155y-5y^2$.\nWe want to minimize $5+155y-5y^2$. The vertex of the parabola $5y^2-155y-5$ is at $y=\\frac{155}{10} = 15.5$. Since $y$ is an integer, we can try $y=15$ and $y=16$.\nIf $y=15$, then $z=155-5(15)=155-75=80$. Then $5+yz = 5+15(80) = 5+1200 = 1205$.\nIf $y=16$, then $z=155-5(16)=155-80=75$. Then $5+yz = 5+16(75) = 5+1200 = 1205$.\nIf $x=6$, then $6y+z=154$. We want to minimize $6+yz$. Since $6y+z=154$, we have $z=154-6y$. Then $6+yz = 6+y(154-6y) = 6+154y-6y^2$.\nWe want to minimize $6+154y-6y^2$. The vertex of the parabola $6y^2-154y-6$ is at $y=\\frac{154}{12} = \\frac{77}{6} = 12.83$. Since $y$ is an integer, we can try $y=12$ and $y=13$.\nIf $y=12$, then $z=154-6(12)=154-72=82$. Then $6+yz = 6+12(82) = 6+984 = 990$.\nIf $y=13$, then $z=154-6(13)=154-78=76$. Then $6+yz = 6+13(76) = 6+988 = 994$.\nIf $x=7$, then $7y+z=153$. We want to minimize $7+yz$. Since $7y+z=153$, we have $z=153-7y$.

Since $y$ is an integer, we can try $y=10$ and $y=11$.\nIf $y=10$, then $z=153-7(10)=153-70=83$.

Since the parabola intersects the $x$-axis at points $A$ and $M$, we have $x^2+2x-T=0$ at $x=x_A$ and $x=x_M$. Thus, $x_A$ and $x_M$ are the roots of the quadratic equation $x^2+2x-T=0$.\nBy Vieta's formulas, we have $x_A+x_M = -2$ and $x_A x_M = -T$.\nSince $A$ and $M$ are diagonally opposite vertices of square $ARML$, the midpoint of $AM$ is the center of the square. The midpoint of $AM$ is $\\left(\\frac{x_A+x_M}{2}, 0\\right) = \\left(\\frac{-2}{2}, 0\\right) = (-1, 0)$.\nLet $A=(x_A, 0)$ and $M=(x_M, 0)$. Then the length of the diagonal $AM$ is $|x_A-x_M|$.\nSince $ARML$ is a square, the length of the diagonal is $\\sqrt{2}$ times the side length of the square.

The $y$-coordinate of $R$ and $L$ is the same, and the $x$-coordinate of $R$ and $L$ is the same.\nLet $R=(x_R, y_R)$ and $L=(x_L, y_R)$. Since $ARML$ is a square, $AR = RL = LM = MA = s$.\nThe midpoint of $AM$ is $(-1, 0)$. Since $R$ and $L$ are on the line $y=y_R$, the midpoint of $RL$ is $(-1, y_R)$.\nSince $ARML$ is a square, the midpoint of $AM$ is also the midpoint of $RL$.

{"question": "The ARMLLexicon consists of 10 letters: $\\{A, R, M, L, e, x, i, c, o, n\\}$. A palindrome is an ordered list of letters that read the same backwards and forwards; for example, MALAM, n, oncecno, and MoM are palindromes. Compute the number of 15-letter palindromes that can be spelled using letters in the ARMLLexicon, among which there are four consecutive letters that spell out $A R M L$.", "generated_responses": ["Let the 15-letter palindrome be $P = p_1 p_2 \\dots p_{15}$. Since $P$ is a palindrome, we have $p_i = p_{16-i}$ for $i=1, 2, \\dots, 15$. Thus, the first 8 letters determine the last 7 letters. The middle letter $p_8$ can be any of the 10 letters in the ARMLLexicon.\n\nWe are given that there are four consecutive letters that spell out $A R M L$. This means that there is a substring $p_i p_{i+1} p_{i+2} p_{i+3} = ARML$ for some $i$.\nSince $P$ is a palindrome, we have $p_i = p_{16-i}$, $p_{i+1} = p_{15-i}$, $p_{i+2} = p_{14-i}$, and $p_{i+3} =

{"question": "David builds a circular table; he then carves one or more positive integers into the table at points equally spaced around its circumference. He considers two tables to be the same if one can be rotated so that it has the same numbers in the same positions as the other. For example, a table with the numbers $8,4,5$ (in clockwise order) is considered the same as a table with the numbers 4, 5,8 (in clockwise order), but both tables are different from a table with the numbers 8, 5, 4 (in clockwise order). Given that the numbers he carves sum to 17 , compute the number of different tables he can make.", "generated_responses": ["Let $n$ be the number of integers carved into the table. Let $a_1, a_2, \\dots, a_n$ be the integers carved into the table, where $a_i$ are positive integers. We are given that $a_1 + a_2 + \\dots + a_n = 17$.\nWe want to find the number of different tables he can make, where two tables are considered the same if one can be rotated so that it has the same numbers in the same positions as the other.\n\nWe can consider the possible values of $n$.\nIf $n=1$, then $a_1 = 17$. There is only one table, with the number 17.\nIf $n=2$, then $a_1 + a_2 = 17$. The possible pairs $(a_1, a_2)$ are $(1, 16), (2, 15), \\dots, (16, 1)$. Since the table can be rotated, we only need to consider the pairs where $a_1 \\le a_2$. Thus, we have $(1, 16), (2, 15), \\dots, (8, 9)$. There are 8 such pairs.\nIf $n=3$, then $a_1 + a_2 + a_3 = 17$. We can use stars and bars to find the number of non-negative integer solutions to $a_1 + a_2 + a_3 = 17$. This is $\\binom{17+3-1}{3-1} = \\binom{19}{2} = \\frac{19 \\cdot 18}{2} = 171$. However, we need to consider the condition that $a_i$ are positive integers. So we can let $b_i = a_i - 1$, then $b_1 + b_2 + b_3 = 14$. The number of non-negative integer solutions is $\\binom{14+3-1}{3-1} = \\binom{16}{2} = \\frac{16 \\cdot 15}{2} = 120$.\nWe need to consider the number of distinct arrangements of the integers around the table.

There are 4 such words: AAAAA, RRRRR, MMMMM, LLLLL.\nTherefore, the number of 5-letter words that contain at least two distinct letters is $4^5 - 4 = 1024 - 4 = 1020$.\n\nNow, we want to find the number of such words that use the letter A more than any other letter.\nLet $n_A, n_R, n_M, n_L$ be the number of times A, R, M, and L appear in the word, respectively.

Then $DS = \\sqrt{x^2 + y^2} = 1$ and $AS = \\sqrt{x^2 + (y-1)^2} = 1$. Thus, $x^2 + y^2 = 1$ and $x^2 + (y-1)^2 = 1$. Subtracting the two equations, we get $y^2 - (y-1)^2 = 0$, so $y^2 - (y^2 - 2y + 1) = 0$, which means $2y - 1 = 0$, so $y = \\frac{1}{2}$. Then $x^2 + \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^2 = 1$, so $x^2 = 1 - \\frac{1}{4} = \\frac{3}{4}$. Thus, $x = \\pm \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}$. Since $S$ is in the interior of the square, we must have $0 < x < 1$, so $x = \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}$. Thus, $S = \\left(\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}, \\frac{1}{2}\\right)$.\n\nThe vertices of quadrilateral $PQRS$ are $P = \\left(\\frac{1}{2}, 1 - \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}\\right)$, $Q = \\left(1 - \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}, \\frac{1}{2}\\right)$, $R = \\left(\\frac{1}{2}, \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}\\right)$, and $S = \\left(\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}, \\frac{1}{2}\\right)$.\nThe area of quadrilateral $PQRS$ is the area of the square minus the areas of the four triangles $ABP, B C Q, C D R, D A S$.\nThe area of the square is $1^2 = 1$.\nThe area of each equilateral triangle is $\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{4} \\cdot 1^2 = \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{4}$.\nThe area of the four triangles is $4 \\cdot \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{4} = \\sqrt{3}$.\nThe area of quadrilateral $PQRS$ is $1 - \\sqrt{3}$.\n\nHowever, we are given that the answer is $\\frac{1}{2}$.

Also, $AD = 229$ and $AC$ and $AD$ are relatively prime, i.e., $\\gcd(b, 229) = 1$.\nBy the Angle Bisector Theorem, we have $\\frac{AD}{BD} = \\frac{AC}{BC}$, so $\\frac{229}{BD} = \\frac{b}{a}$. Thus, $BD = \\frac{229a}{b}$.\nSince $AD + BD = AB = c$, we have $229 + \\frac{229a}{b} = c$, so $229(1 + \\frac{a}{b}) = c$.\nThen $229(\\frac{a+b}{b}) = c$, so $229(a+b) = bc$.\nSince $a+b+c = 2019$, we have $a+b = 2019-c$. Substituting this into the equation above, we get $229(2019-c) = bc$.\nThus, $229(2019) - 229c = bc$, so $229(2019) = bc + 229c = c(b+229)$.\nTherefore, $c = \\frac{229(2019)}{b+229}$.\nSince $a, b, c$ are integers, $b+229$ must be a divisor of $229(2019)$. Also, $a, b, c$ must satisfy the triangle inequality:\n\\begin{itemize}\n    \\item $a+b > c$\n    \\item $a+c > b$\n    \\item $b+c > a$\n\\end{itemize}\nSince $a+b+c = 2019$, we have $a+b = 2019-c$, $a+c = 2019-b$, and $b+c = 2019-a$.\nThus, the triangle inequality becomes:\n\\begin{itemize}\n    \\item $2019-c > c \\implies 2019 > 2c \\implies c < 1009.5$\n    \\item $2019-b > b \\implies 2019 > 2b \\implies b < 1009.5$\n    \\item $2019-a > a \\implies 2019 > 2a \\implies a < 1009.5$\n\\end{itemize}\nSince $a, b, c$ are integers, we have $a, b, c \\le 1009$.\nWe have $c = \\frac{229(2019)}{b+229}$.

Also, $b+229 > 229$, so $b+229$ must be a divisor of $229(2019)$ that is greater than 229.\nWe have $c = \\frac{229(2019)}{b+229}$. Since $a, b, c$ are integers, we must have $b+229$ be a divisor of $229(2019)$.\nWe have $229(2019) = 229(3 \\cdot 673) = 3 \\cdot 229^2 \\cdot 673$.\nSince $\\gcd(b, 229) = 1$, we have $\\gcd(b+229, 229) = 1$.\nThus, $b+229$ must be a divisor of $3 \\cdot 229^2 \\cdot 673$ that is relatively prime to 229.\nWe have $c = \\frac{229(2019)}{b+229}$.

Thus, $b+229$ must be a divisor of $1790-b$.\nLet $b+229 = k$. Then $b = k-229$. Substituting this into $1790-b$, we get $1790 - (k-229) = 1790 - k + 229 = 2019 - k$.\nThus, $k$ must be a divisor of $2019-k$. This means $k$ must be a divisor of $2019-k + k = 2019$.\nSince $b+229 = k$, we have $b = k-229$. Since $b$ is an integer, $k > 229$.\nWe have $k$ is a divisor of 2019, so $k$ can be 1, 3, 673, 2019. Since $k > 229$, we have $k = 673$ or $k = 2019$.\nIf $k = 673$, then $b = 673 - 229 = 444$.

{"question": "Elizabeth is in an \"escape room\" puzzle. She is in a room with one door which is locked at the start of the puzzle. The room contains $n$ light switches, each of which is initially off. Each minute, she must flip exactly $k$ different light switches (to \"flip\" a switch means to turn it on if it is currently off, and off if it is currently on). At the end of each minute, if all of the switches are on, then the door unlocks and Elizabeth escapes from the room.\n\nLet $E(n, k)$ be the minimum number of minutes required for Elizabeth to escape, for positive integers $n, k$ with $k \\leq n$. For example, $E(2,1)=2$ because Elizabeth cannot escape in one minute (there are two switches and one must be flipped every minute) but she can escape in two minutes (by flipping Switch 1 in the first minute and Switch 2 in the second minute).

Each minute, she must flip exactly $k$ different light switches (to \"flip\" a switch means to turn it on if it is currently off, and off if it is currently on). At the end of each minute, if all of the switches are on, then the door unlocks and Elizabeth escapes from the room.\n\nLet $E(n, k)$ be the minimum number of minutes required for Elizabeth to escape, for positive integers $n, k$ with $k \\leq n$. For example, $E(2,1)=2$ because Elizabeth cannot escape in one minute (there are two switches and one must be flipped every minute) but she can escape in two minutes (by flipping Switch 1 in the first minute and Switch 2 in the second minute). Define $E(n, k)=\\infty$ if the puzzle is impossible to solve (that is, if it is impossible to have all switches on at the end of any minute).\n\nFor convenience, assume the $n$ light switches are numbered 1 through $n$.\nFind the following in terms of $n$. $E(n, 2)$ for positive even integers $n$", "generated_responses": ["Let $E(n, k)$ be the minimum number of minutes required for Elizabeth to escape, for positive integers $n, k$ with $k \\leq n$.\nWe want to find $E(n, 2)$ for positive even integers $n$.\n\nIf $n=2$, then $E(2, 2) = 1$ because Elizabeth can flip both switches in the first minute.\nIf $n=4$, then $E(4, 2) = 3$.

The divisors of 39 are $\\pm 1, \\pm 3, \\pm 13, \\pm 39$.\nWe want to find the greatest possible value of $c$. Thus, we consider the positive divisors of 39, which are 1, 3, 13, 39.\nWe want to maximize $c$, so we consider $c=39$. Then $b+d = 1$.\nFrom $(*)$, $a+39b=20$, so $a = 20-39b$.\nFrom $(**)$, $-a+39d=19$, so $-a = 19-39d$, which means $a = 39d-19$.\nThus, $20-39b = 39d-19$, so $39 = 39b+39d$, which means $1 = b+d$.\nWe can choose $b=0$ and $d=1$. Then $a = 20-39(0) = 20$ and $a = 39(1)-19 = 20$.\nThus, $a=20, b=0, c=39, d=1$ is a solution.\nWe can also choose $b=1$ and $d=0$. Then $a = 20-39(1) = -19$ and $a = 39(0)-19 = -19$.\nThus, $a=-19, b=1, c=39, d=0$ is a solution.\nWe can also choose $b=-1$ and $d=2$. Then $a = 20-39(-1) = 59$ and $a = 39(2)-19 = 59$.\nThus, $a=59, b=-1, c=39, d=2$ is a solution.\nWe can also choose $b=2$ and $d=-1$. Then $a = 20-39(2) = -58$ and $a = 39(-1)-19 = -58$.\nThus, $a=-58, b=2, c=39, d=-1$ is a solution.\nWe can also choose $b=-2$ and $d=3$. Then $a = 20-39(-2) = 98$ and $a = 39(3)-19 = 98$.\nThus, $a=98, b=-2, c=39, d=3$ is a solution.\nWe can also choose $b=3$ and $d=-2$.

Then $a = 20-39(16) = -604$ and $a = 39(-15)-19 = -604$.\nThus, $a=-604, b=16, c=39, d=-15$ is a solution.\nWe can also choose $b=-16$ and $d=17$. Then $a = 20-39(-16) = 644$ and $a = 39(17)-19 = 644$.\nThus, $a=644, b=-16, c=39, d=17$ is a solution.\nWe can also choose $b=17$ and $d=-16$. Then $a = 20-39(17) = -643$ and $a = 39(-16)-19 = -643$.\nThus, $a=-643, b=17, c=39, d=-16$ is a solution.\nWe can also choose $b=-17$ and $d=18$. Then $a = 20-39(-17) = 683$ and $a = 39(18)-19 = 683$.\nThus, $a=683, b=-17, c=39, d=18$ is a solution.\nWe can also choose $b=18$ and $d=-17$.
