{"question": "If $f(x)$ is a polynomial of degree 7, and $g(x)$ is a polynomial of degree 7, then what is the product of the minimum and the maximum possible degrees of $f(x) + g(x)$?", "generated_responses": ["Let $f(x)$ and $g(x)$ be polynomials of degree 7.\nThe degree of $f(x)$ is 7, so we can write $f(x) = a_7 x^7 + a_6 x^6 + \\dots + a_1 x + a_0$, where $a_7 \\neq 0$.\nThe degree of $g(x)$ is 7, so we can write $g(x) = b_7 x^7 + b_6 x^6 + \\dots + b_1 x + b_0$, where $b_7 \\neq 0$.\nThen $f(x) + g(x) = (a_7 x^7 + a_6 x^6 + \\dots + a_1 x + a_0) + (b_7 x^7 + b_6 x^6 + \\dots + b_1 x + b_0) = (a_7 + b_7) x^7 + (a_6 + b_6) x^6 + \\dots + (a_1 + b_1) x + (a_0 + b_0)$.\n\nThe degree of $f(x) + g(x)$ is the highest power of $x$ with a non-zero coefficient.\nThe degree of $f(x) + g(x)$ is at most 7, since the highest power of $x$ is $x^7$.\nThe degree of $f(x) + g(x)$ is at least 0, since $f(x)$ and $g(x)$ are polynomials of degree 7, so they have non-zero constant terms.\n\nThe maximum possible degree of $f(x) + g(x)$ is 7. This occurs when $a_7 + b_7 \\neq 0$.\nThe minimum possible degree of $f(x) + g(x)$ is 0. This occurs when $a_7 + b_7 = 0$, $a_6 + b_6 = 0$, ..., $a_1 + b_1 = 0$, $a_0 + b_0 \\neq 0$.\nIn this case, $f(x) + g(x) = a_0 + b_0$, which is a constant polynomial of degree 0.\n\nThe product of the minimum and maximum possible degrees of $f(x) + g(x)$ is $0 \\times 7 = 0$.\n\nFinal Answer: The final answer is $\\boxed{0}$"], "id": "1", "generated_answers": ["0"], "gold_answer": "0", "is_correct": true, "answers_correctness": [true]}
