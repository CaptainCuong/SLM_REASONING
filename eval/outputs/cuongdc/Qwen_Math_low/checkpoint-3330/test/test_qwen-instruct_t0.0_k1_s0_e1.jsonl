{"question": "If $f(x)$ is a polynomial of degree 7, and $g(x)$ is a polynomial of degree 7, then what is the product of the minimum and the maximum possible degrees of $f(x) + g(x)$?", "generated_responses": ["Let $f(x)$ be a polynomial of degree 7, and $g(x)$ be a polynomial of degree 7.\nWe want to find the product of the minimum and maximum possible degrees of $f(x) + g(x)$.\n\nThe degree of $f(x)$ is 7, so we can write $f(x) = a_7 x^7 + a_6 x^6 + \\dots + a_1 x + a_0$, where $a_7 \\neq 0$.\nThe degree of $g(x)$ is 7, so we can write $g(x) = b_7 x^7 + b_6 x^6 + \\dots + b_1 x + b_0$, where $b_7 \\neq 0$.\nThen $f(x) + g(x) = (a_7 x^7 + a_6 x^6 + \\dots + a_1 x + a_0) + (b_7 x^7 + b_6 x^6 + \\dots + b_1 x + b_0) = (a_7 + b_7) x^7 + (a_6 + b_6) x^6 + \\dots + (a_1 + b_1) x + (a_0 + b_0)$.\n\nThe degree of $f(x) + g(x)$ is the highest power of $x$ with a non-zero coefficient.\nThe degree of $f(x) + g(x)$ is at most 7, since the highest power of $x$ is $x^7$.\nThe degree of $f(x) + g(x)$ is 7 if $a_7 + b_7 \\neq 0$.\nThe degree of $f(x) + g(x)$ is less than 7 if $a_7 + b_7 = 0$.\n\nIf $a_7 + b_7 = 0$, then $b_7 = -a_7$. In this case, the $x^7$ term cancels out.\nThen $f(x) + g(x) = (a_6 + b_6) x^6 + \\dots + (a_1 + b_1) x + (a_0 + b_0)$.\nThe degree of $f(x) + g(x)$ is at most 6.\nThe degree of $f(x) + g(x)$ is 6 if $a_6 + b_6 \\neq 0$.\nThe degree of $f(x) + g(x)$ is less than 6 if $a_6 + b_6 = 0$.\nWe can continue this process until we reach the constant term.\nIf $a_7 + b_7 = a_6 + b_6 = \\dots = a_1 + b_1 = 0$, then $f(x) + g(x) = a_0 + b_0$.\nIf $a_0 + b_0 \\neq 0$, then the degree of $f(x) + g(x)$ is 0.\nIf $a_0 + b_0 = 0$, then $f(x) + g(x) = 0$, which has no degree.\n\nThe maximum possible degree of $f(x) + g(x)$ is 7, which occurs when $a_7 + b_7 \\neq 0$.\nThe minimum possible degree of $f(x) + g(x)$ is 0, which occurs when $a_7 + b_7 = a_6 + b_6 = \\dots = a_1 + b_1 = a_0 + b_0 = 0$.\nThe product of the minimum and maximum possible degrees is $7 \\times 0 = 0$.\n\nFinal Answer: The final answer is $\\boxed{0}$"], "id": "1", "generated_answers": ["0"], "gold_answer": "0", "is_correct": true, "answers_correctness": [true]}
