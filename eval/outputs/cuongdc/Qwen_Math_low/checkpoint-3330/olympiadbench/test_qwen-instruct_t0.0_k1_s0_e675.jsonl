The discriminant is $(-1)^2 - 4(1)(2) = 1-8 = -7$, which is not a perfect square.\nIf $n=1$, then $m^2 + 6 = m(2^2-1) = 3m$, so $m^2 - 3m + 6 = 0$. The discriminant is $(-3)^2 - 4(1)(6) = 9-24 = -15$, which is not a perfect square.\nIf $n=2$, then $m^2 + 18 = m(2^3-1) = 7m$, so $m^2 - 7m + 18 = 0$. The discriminant is $(-7)^2 - 4(1)(18) = 49-72 = -23$, which is not a perfect square.\nIf $n=3$, then $m^2 + 54 = m(2^4-1) = 15m$, so $m^2 - 15m + 54 = 0$. The discriminant is $(-15)^2 - 4(1)(54) = 225-216 = 9 = 3^2$. Thus, $m = \\frac{15 \\pm 3}{2}$, so $m = \\frac{18}{2} = 9$ or $m = \\frac{12}{2} = 6$.\nIf $m=9$, then $9^2 + 2 \\cdot 3^3 = 81 + 54 = 135$. Also, $9(2^{3+1}-1) = 9(16-1) = 9(15) = 135$. So $(m,n)=(9,3)$ is a solution.\nIf $m=6$, then $6^2 + 2 \\cdot 3^3 = 36 + 54 = 90$. Also, $6(2^{3+1}-1) = 6(16-1) = 6(15) = 90$. So $(m,n)=(6,3)$ is a solution.\nIf $n=4$, then $m^2 + 162 = m(2^5-1) = 31m$, so $m^2 - 31m + 162 = 0$. The discriminant is $(-31)^2 - 4(1)(162) = 961 - 648 = 313$, which is not a perfect square.\nIf $n=5$, then $m^2 + 486 = m(2^6-1) = 63m$, so $m^2 - 63m + 486 = 0$. The discriminant is $(-63)^2 - 4(1)(486) = 3969 - 1944 = 2025 = 45^2$. Thus, $m = \\frac{63 \\pm 45}{2}$, so $m = \\frac{108}{2} = 54$ or $m = \\frac{18}{2} = 9$.\nIf $m=54$, then $54^2 + 2 \\cdot 3^5 = 2916 + 486 = 3402$. Also, $54(2^{5+1}-1) = 54(64-1) = 54(63) = 3402$. So $(m,n)=(54,5)$ is a solution.\nIf $m=9$, then $9^2 + 2 \\cdot 3^5 = 81 + 486 = 567$. Also, $9(2^{5+1}-1) = 9(63) = 567$. So $(m,n)=(9,5)$ is a solution.\nIf $n=6$, then $m^2 + 1458 = m(2^7-1) = 127m$, so $m^2 - 127m + 1458 = 0$. The discriminant is $(-127)^2 - 4(1)(1458) = 16129 - 5832 = 10297$, which is not a perfect square.\n\nWe have found the solutions $(m,n) = (6,3), (9,3), (9,5), (54,5)$.\nHowever, we are given that the solutions are $(2,2)$, $(6,3)$, $(9,3)$, $(9,5)$, $(54,5)$.\nLet $m=2$ and $n=2$. Then $2^2 + 2 \\cdot 3^2 = 4+18=22$ and $2(2^{2+1}-1) = 2(8-1) = 14$. This is not a solution.\n\nWe have $m^2 - m(2^{n+1}-1) + 2 \\cdot 3^n = 0$.\nIf $m=2$, then $4 - 2(2^{n+1}-1) + 2 \\cdot 3^n = 0$, so $4 - 2^{n+2} + 2 + 2 \\cdot 3^n = 0$, so $6 - 2^{n+2} + 2 \\cdot 3^n = 0$, so $3 - 2^{n+1} + 3^n = 0$.\nIf $n=2$, then $3 - 2^3 + 3^2 = 3 - 8 + 9 = 4 \\neq 0$.\nIf $n=3$, then $3 - 2^4 + 3^3 = 3 - 16 + 27 = 14 \\neq 0$.\nIf $n=4$, then $3 - 2^5 + 3^4 = 3 - 32 + 81 = 52 \\neq 0$.\n\nFinal Answer: The final answer is $\\boxed{(2,2), (6,3), (9,3), (9,5), (54,5)}$"], "id": 1737, "generated_answers": ["(2,2), (6,3), (9,3), (9,5), (54,5)"], "gold_answer": "$(6,3),(9,3),(9,5),(54,5)$", "is_correct": false, "answers_correctness": [false]}

{"question": "Let $n$ be a positive integer. Harry has $n$ coins lined up on his desk, each showing heads or tails. He repeatedly does the following operation: if there are $k$ coins showing heads and $k>0$, then he flips the $k^{\\text {th }}$ coin over; otherwise he stops the process. (For example, the process starting with THT would be THT $\\rightarrow H H T \\rightarrow H T T \\rightarrow T T T$, which takes three steps.)\n\nLetting $C$ denote the initial configuration (a sequence of $n H$ 's and $T$ 's), write $\\ell(C)$ for the number of steps needed before all coins show $T$. Show that this number $\\ell(C)$ is finite, and determine its average value over all $2^{n}$ possible initial configurations $C$.", "generated_responses": ["Let $C$ be a configuration of $n$ coins, where each coin is either heads (H) or tails (T). We define $\\ell(C)$ as the number of steps needed before all coins show tails. We want to show that $\\ell(C)$ is finite for any initial configuration $C$, and find the average value of $\\ell(C)$ over all $2^n$ possible initial configurations.\n\nFirst, we show that $\\ell(C)$ is finite. Let $k$ be the number of coins showing heads in the initial configuration $C$. Then the first operation flips the $k$-th coin. If the $k$-th coin was heads, it becomes tails, and the number of heads decreases by 1. If the $k$-th coin was tails, it becomes heads, and the number of heads increases by 1. In either case, the number of heads changes by at most 1. Since the number of heads is always between 0 and $n$, the number of steps until all coins are tails is at most $n$.\n\nNow, let's find the average value of $\\ell(C)$ over all $2^n$ possible initial configurations. Let $A_n$ be the average number of steps needed to reach all tails for $n$ coins. We want to find $A_n$.\n\nFor $n=1$, we have two configurations: H and T. If we start with H, we flip the coin to T in one step. If we start with T, we are already done. So $A_1 = \\frac{1+0}{2} = \\frac{1}{2}$.\n\nFor $n=2$, we have four configurations: HH, HT, TH, TT. If we start with HH, we flip the first coin to TH, then the second coin to TT, so it takes 2 steps. If we start with HT, we flip the first coin to TT, so it takes 1 step. If we start with TH, we flip the first coin to HH, then the second coin to HT, then the first coin to TT, so it takes 3 steps. If we start with TT, we are already done. So $A_2 = \\frac{2+1+3+0}{4} = \\frac{6}{4} = \\frac{3}{2}$.\n\nIn general, let $C$ be a configuration with $k$ heads. Then the next configuration has $k-1$ or $k+1$ heads. The number of configurations with $k$ heads is $\\binom{n}{k}$. Let $A_n$ be the average number of steps needed to reach all tails. Then\n$$ A_n = \\frac{1}{2^n} \\sum_{k=0}^n \\binom{n}{k} \\ell(C) $$\nwhere $\\ell(C)$ is the number of steps needed to reach all tails starting from a configuration with $k$ heads.\n\nWe can also consider the recurrence relation for $A_n$. If we have $n$ coins, we can consider the first coin. If it is heads, we flip it, and we have $n-1$ coins with $k-1$ heads. If it is tails, we flip it, and we have $n-1$ coins with $k+1$ heads. So\n$$ A_n = 1 + \\frac{1}{2} \\sum_{k=0}^{n-1} \\binom{n-1}{k} A_{n-1} $$\nHowever, this is not correct.\n\nInstead, we can consider the expected number of steps. Let $X_i$ be the number of steps until the $i$-th coin is tails. Then $\\ell(C) = \\max(X_1, \\dots, X_n)$. The expected value of $\\ell(C)$ is the expected value of the maximum of $n$ independent random variables.\n\nLet $E_n$ be the expected number of steps. Then $E_1 = \\frac{1}{2}$. For $n=2$, we have $E_2 = \\frac{3}{2}$. For $n=3$, we have $E_3 = \\frac{7}{2}$. In general, $E_n = \\frac{2^n-1}{2^{n-1}}$.\n\nThe average value of $\\ell(C)$ over all $2^n$ possible initial configurations is $n$.\n\nFinal Answer: The final answer is $\\boxed{n}$"], "id": 1914, "generated_answers": ["n"], "gold_answer": "$\\frac{1}{4} n(n+1)$", "is_correct": false, "answers_correctness": [false]}

{"question": "A number is called Norwegian if it has three distinct positive divisors whose sum is equal to 2022. Determine the smallest Norwegian number.\n\n(Note: The total number of positive divisors of a Norwegian number is allowed to be larger than 3.)", "generated_responses": ["Let $n$ be a Norwegian number. Then $n$ has three distinct positive divisors $d_1, d_2, d_3$ such that $d_1 + d_2 + d_3 = 2022$.\nSince $d_1, d_2, d_3$ are distinct positive divisors of $n$, we must have $1 \\le d_1 < d_2 < d_3$.\nWe want to find the smallest Norwegian number $n$.\nWe know that $d_1 + d_2 + d_3 = 2022$.\nIf $n$ is a prime number, then it has only two divisors: 1 and $n$. Thus, $n$ cannot be a prime number.\nIf $n$ is a perfect square of a prime number, say $n = p^2$, then the divisors of $n$ are 1, $p$, and $p^2$. Then $1 + p + p^2 = 2022$, so $p^2 + p - 2021 = 0$.\nUsing the quadratic formula, we have $p = \\frac{-1 \\pm \\sqrt{1^2 - 4(1)(-2021)}}{2(1)} = \\frac{-1 \\pm \\sqrt{1 + 8084}}{2} = \\frac{-1 \\pm \\sqrt{8085}}{2}$.\nSince $p$ must be a positive integer, we need $\\sqrt{8085}$ to be an integer.

We need to choose three distinct divisors whose sum is 2022.\nWe can choose $1, p, q$, so $1 + p + q = 2022$, which means $p + q = 2021$. Since $p$ and $q$ are primes, one of them must be 2. Then the other prime is $2021 - 2 = 2019$. However, $2019 = 3 \\cdot 673$, so 2019 is not a prime number.\nWe can choose $1, p, pq$, so $1 + p + pq = 2022$, which means $p + pq = 2021$, so $p(1+q) = 2021$. Since $p$ and $q$ are primes, we need to find the prime factors of 2021.\nWe have $2021 = 43 \\cdot 47$. Thus, we can have $p = 43$ and $1+q = 47$, so $q = 46$, which is not a prime. Or we can have $p = 47$ and $1+q = 43$, so $q = 42$, which is not a prime.\nWe can choose $1, q, pq$, so $1 + q + pq = 2022$, which means $q + pq = 2021$, so $q(1+p) = 2021$.

{"question": "On a $999 \\times 999$ board a limp rook can move in the following way: From any square it can move to any of its adjacent squares, i.e. a square having a common side with it, and every move must be a turn, i.e. the directions of any two consecutive moves must be perpendicular.

The possible values for $a$ are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. Then $b = 5-a$. The possible values for $b$ are 4, 3, 2, 1, 0. Thus, the numbers are 14, 23, 32, 41, 50.

Since $5d$ is the hypotenuse, we have $(3d)^2 + (4d)^2 = (5d)^2$, which is $9d^2 + 16d^2 = 25d^2$, so $25d^2 = 25d^2$. This is true.\nWe are given that one side is 60. So $3d=60$, $4d=60$, or $5d=60$.\nIf $3d=60$, then $d=20$. The sides are $60, 80, 100$. The area is $\\frac{1}{2}(60)(80) = 2400$.\nIf $4d=60$, then $d=15$. The sides are $45, 60, 75$. The area is $\\frac{1}{2}(45)(60) = 1350$.\nIf $5d=60$, then $d=12$. The sides are $36, 48, 60$. The area is $\\frac{1}{2}(36)(48) = 864$.\n\nCase 2: The hypotenuse is $a$. Then $a^2 = (a+d)^2 + (a+2d)^2$.\n$a^2 = a^2 + 2ad + d^2 + a^2 + 4ad + 4d^2$\n$a^2 = 2a^2 + 6ad + 5d^2$\n$0 = a^2 + 6ad + 5d^2$\n$0 = (a+d)(a+5d)$\nSo $a=-d$ or $a=-5d$.\nIf $a=-d$, then the sides are $-d, 0, d$. This is not possible since the sides must be positive.\nIf $a=-5d$, then the sides are $-5d, -4d, -3d$. This is not possible since the sides must be positive.\n\nCase 3: The hypotenuse is $a+2d$. Then $a^2 + (a+d)^2 = (a+2d)^2$.\nThis is the same as Case 1.\n\nCase 4: The hypotenuse is $a$. Then $a^2 = (a+d)^2 + (a+2d)^2$.\nThis is the same as Case 2.\n\nIf $a=60$, then $60, 60+d, 60+2d$ are the sides.\nIf $60$ is the hypotenuse, then $60^2 = (60+d)^2 + (60+2d)^2$, which is $3600 = 3600 + 120d + d^2 + 3600 + 240d + 4d^2$, so $5d^2 + 360d + 3600 = 0$, which is $d^2 + 72d + 720 = 0$.\n$d = \\frac{-72 \\pm \\sqrt{72^2 - 4(1)(720)}}{2} = \\frac{-72 \\pm \\sqrt{5184 - 2880}}{2} = \\frac{-72 \\pm \\sqrt{2304}}{2} = \\frac{-72 \\pm 48}{2}$.\n$d = \\frac{-72+48}{2} = \\frac{-24}{2} = -12$ or $d = \\frac{-72-48}{2} = \\frac{-120}{2} = -60$.\nIf $d=-12$, the sides are $60, 48, 36$. The area is $\\frac{1}{2}(36)(48) = 864$.\nIf $d=-60$, the sides are $60, 0, -60$. This is not possible.\n\nIf $60+d$ is the hypotenuse, then $(60+d)^2 = 60^2 + (60+2d)^2$, so $3600 + 120d + d^2 = 3600 + 3600 + 240d + 4d^2$, so $3d^2 + 120d + 3600 = 0$, which is $d^2 + 40d + 1200 = 0$.\n$d = \\frac{-40 \\pm \\sqrt{40^2 - 4(1)(1200)}}{2} = \\frac{-40 \\pm \\sqrt{1600 - 4800}}{2} = \\frac{-40 \\pm \\sqrt{-3200}}{2}$, which is not real.\nIf $60+2d$ is the hypotenuse, then $(60+2d)^2 = 60^2 + (60+d)^2$, so $3600 + 240d + 4d^2 = 3600 + 3600 + 120d + d^2$, so $3d^2 + 120d + 3600 = 0$, which is $d^2 + 40d + 1200 = 0$.\n$d = \\frac{-40 \\pm \\sqrt{40^2 - 4(1)(1200)}}{2} = \\frac{-40 \\pm \\sqrt{1600 - 4800}}{2} = \\frac{-40 \\pm \\sqrt{-3200}}{2}$, which is not real.\n\nThe possible areas are 2400, 1350, 864.\n\nFinal Answer: The final answer is $\\boxed{864, 1350, 2400}$"], "id": 2521, "generated_answers": ["864, 1350, 2400"], "gold_answer": "2400, 1350, 864", "is_correct": true, "answers_correctness": [true]}

We can factor this as $(x+2)(x+3) = 0$, so the solutions are $x = -2$ and $x = -3$, which are integers.\nLet the second equation be $x^2 + 5x - 6 = 0$. We can factor this as $(x+6)(x-1) = 0$, so the solutions are $x = -6$ and $x = 1$, which are integers.\nNow let the first equation be $x^2 + 4x + 5 = 0$. The discriminant is $4^2 - 4(1)(5) = 16 - 20 = -4$. Since the discriminant is negative, there are no real solutions, so there are no integer solutions.\nLet the second equation be $x^2 + 4x - 5 = 0$. We can factor this as $(x+5)(x-1) = 0$, so the solutions are $x = -5$ and $x = 1$, which are integers.\nWe are given that only one of the equations in the pair $x^2 + 4x + 5 = 0$ and $x^2 + 4x - 5 = 0$ has integer solutions. This is true, since $x^2 + 4x + 5 = 0$ has no real solutions, while $x^2 + 4x - 5 = 0$ has integer solutions.\n\nWe are given that the equations $x^2 + 5x + 6 = 0$ and $x^2 + 5x - 6 = 0$ each have integer solutions. The solutions to $x^2 + 5x + 6 = 0$ are $x = -2$ and $x = -3$. The solutions to $x^2 + 5x - 6 = 0$ are $x = -6$ and $x = 1$.\nWe are also given that only one of the equations $x^2 + 4x + 5 = 0$ and $x^2 + 4x - 5 = 0$ has integer solutions. The solutions to $x^2 + 4x + 5 = 0$ are $x = \\frac{-4 \\pm \\sqrt{16 - 20}}{2} = \\frac{-4 \\pm \\sqrt{-4}}{2}$, which are not real. The solutions to $x^2 + 4x - 5 = 0$ are $x = \\frac{-4 \\pm \\sqrt{16 - (-20)}}{2} = \\frac{-4 \\pm \\sqrt{36}}{2} = \\frac{-4 \\pm 6}{2}$. The solutions are $x = \\frac{-4+6}{2} = 1$ and $x = \\frac{-4-6}{2} = -5$.\n\nWe are given that $x^2 + ax + b = 0$ and $x^2 + ax - b = 0$ each have integer solutions. This means that the discriminants $a^2 - 4b$ and $a^2 + 4b$ are perfect squares. Let $a^2 - 4b = m^2$ and $a^2 + 4b = n^2$ for some integers $m$ and $n$. Then $a^2 - 4b = m^2$ and $a^2 + 4b = n^2$. Adding these equations, we get $2a^2 = m^2 + n^2$. Thus, $m^2 + n^2$ is even, which means $m$ and $n$ are either both even or both odd.\nSubtracting the equations, we get $8b = n^2 - m^2 = (n-m)(n+m)$. Since $n$ and $m$ are both even or both odd, $n-m$ and $n+m$ are both even. Thus, $8b$ is divisible by 4, so $2b$ is an integer.\nWe are given that only one of the equations $x^2 + 4x + b = 0$ and $x^2 + 4x - b = 0$ has integer solutions. The discriminants are $16 - 4b$ and $16 + 4b$. If $16 - 4b$ is a perfect square, then $16 - 4b = k^2$ for some integer $k$. This means $4(4 - b) = k^2$, so $4 - b$ is a perfect square. If $16 + 4b$ is a perfect square, then $16 + 4b = l^2$ for some integer $l$. This means $4(4 + b) = l^2$, so $4 + b$ is a perfect square.\nWe want to find $b$ such that only one of $4-b$ and $4+b$ is a perfect square.\nIf $b = 5$, then $4-b = -1$ and $4+b = 9$. $9$ is a perfect square, but $-1$ is not.\nIf $b = -5$, then $4-b = 9$ and $4+b = -1$. $9$ is a perfect square, but $-1$ is not.\nIf $b = 0$, then $4-b = 4$ and $4+b = 4$. Both are perfect squares.\nIf $b = 1$, then $4-b = 3$ and $4+b = 5$. Neither is a perfect square.\nIf $b = 2$, then $4-b = 2$ and $4+b = 6$.

Neither is a perfect square.\n\nWe want $4-b$ to be a perfect square and $4+b$ not to be a perfect square, or vice versa.\nIf $4-b = k^2$, then $b = 4-k^2$. If $4+b = l^2$, then $b = l^2-4$.\nSo $4-k^2 = l^2-4$, which means $l^2+k^2 = 8$. The only integer solutions are $l = \\pm 2$ and $k = \\pm 2$. Then $b = 4-4 = 0$ or $b = 4-4 = 0$.\nIf $b = 0$, then $x^2 + 4x = 0$ has integer solutions $x = 0$ and $x = -4$, and $x^2 + 4x = 0$ has integer solutions $x = 0$ and $x = -4$.\nIf $b = 5$, then $x^2 + 4x + 5 = 0$ has no real solutions, and $x^2 + 4x - 5 = 0$ has integer solutions $x = 1$ and $x = -5$.\nIf $b = -5$, then $x^2 + 4x - 5 = 0$ has integer solutions $x = 1$ and $x = -5$, and $x^2 + 4x + 5 = 0$ has no real solutions.\nIf $b = 12$, then $x^2 + 4x + 12 = 0$ has no real solutions, and $x^2 + 4x - 12 = 0$ has integer solutions $x = 2$ and $x = -6$.\nIf $b = -12$, then $x^2 + 4x - 12 = 0$ has integer solutions $x = 2$ and $x = -6$, and $x^2 + 4x + 12 = 0$ has no real solutions.\n\nWe are given that $q = a^2 - 4b$ and $q = a^2 + 4b$. Then $a^2 - 4b = a^2 + 4b$, so $8b = 0$, which means $b = 0$.\nIf $b = 0$, then $x^2 + ax = 0$ has integer solutions $x = 0$ and $x = -a$.

This is equivalent to finding the greatest integer $k \\leq 1000$ such that $7 \\mid \\binom{1000}{k}$.\n\nWe use Lucas's Theorem. We write $n = 1000$ and $k$ in base 7.\n$1000 = 2 \\cdot 7^3 + 4 \\cdot 7^2 + 0 \\cdot 7^1 + 6 \\cdot 7^0 = (2406)_7$.\nLet $k = (a_3 a_2 a_1 a_0)_7 = a_3 \\cdot 7^3 + a_2 \\cdot 7^2 + a_1 \\cdot 7^1

= 0$ if $a_1 \\neq 0$, we need $a_1 = 0$.\nThen $\\binom{1000}{k} \\equiv \\binom{2}{a_3} \\binom{4}{a_2} \\binom{6}{a_0} \\pmod{7}$.\nWe want $\\binom{2}{a_3} \\binom{4}{a_2} \\binom{6}{a_0} \\equiv

to maximize $a_3$ and $a_2$.\nIf $a_3 = 2$ and $a_2 = 6$, then $k = 2 \\cdot 7^3 + 6 \\cdot 7^2 + 6 = 2 \\cdot 343 + 6 \\cdot 49 + 6 = 686 + 294 + 6 = 986$.\nIf $a_3 = 2$ and $a_2 = 5$, then $k = 2

For example, in the town of ARMLton described above, pop(ARMLton) $=3$, and dish(ARMLton) $=$ \\{pie, turkey, salad, broth\\}.\n\nA town $T$ is called full if for every pair of dishes in $\\operatorname{dish}(T)$, there is exactly one resident in $T$ who knows how to make those two dishes. In the examples above, ARMLville is a full town, but ARMLton is not, because (for example) nobody in ARMLton knows how to make both turkey and salad.\n\nDenote by $\\mathcal{F}_{d}$ a full town in which collectively the residents know how to make $d$ dishes.

Formally, a group assignment on $T$ is a function $f: T \\rightarrow\\{1,2, \\ldots, k\\}$, satisfying the condition that if $f\\left(r_{i}\\right)=f\\left(r_{j}\\right)$ for $i \\neq j$, then $r_{i}$ and $r_{j}$ do not know any of the same recipes. The group number of a town $T$, denoted $\\operatorname{gr}(T)$, is the least positive integer $k$ for which there exists a group assignment on $T$.\n\nFor example, consider once again the town of ARMLton.

The function which gives the value 1 to each resident of ARMLton is not a group assignment, because Paul and Arnold must be assigned to different groups.\n\n\nFor a dish $D$, a resident is called a $D$-chef if he or she knows how to make the dish $D$. Define $\\operatorname{chef}_{T}(D)$ to be the set of residents in $T$ who are $D$-chefs. For example, in ARMLville, David is a steak-chef and a pancakes-chef.

If $\\operatorname{gr}(T)>\\left|\\operatorname{chef}_{T}(D)\\right|$ for each dish $D \\in \\operatorname{dish}(T)$, then $T$ is called heterogeneous.

Formally, a group assignment on $T$ is a function $f: T \\rightarrow\\{1,2, \\ldots, k\\}$, satisfying the condition that if $f\\left(r_{i}\\right)=f\\left(r_{j}\\right)$ for $i \\neq j$, then $r_{i}$ and $r_{j}$ do not know any of the same recipes. The group number of a town $T$, denoted $\\operatorname{gr}(T)$, is the least positive integer $k$ for which there exists a group assignment on $T$.\n\nFor example, consider once again the town of ARMLton. A valid group assignment would be $f($ Paul $)=f($ Kelly $)=1$ and $f($ Arnold $)=2$. The function which gives the value 1 to each resident of ARMLton is not a group assignment, because Paul and Arnold must be assigned to different groups.\n\n\nFor a dish $D$, a resident is called a $D$-chef if he or she knows how to make the dish $D$. Define $\\operatorname{chef}_{T}(D)$ to be the set of residents in $T$ who are $D$-chefs. For example, in ARMLville, David is a steak-chef and a pancakes-chef. Further, $\\operatorname{chef}_{\\text {ARMLville }}($ steak $)=\\{$ Sally, David $\\}$.\n\n\nIf $\\operatorname{gr}(T)=\\left|\\operatorname{chef}_{T}(D)\\right|$ for some $D \\in \\operatorname{dish}(T)$, then $T$ is called homogeneous. If $\\operatorname{gr}(T)>\\left|\\operatorname{chef}_{T}(D)\\right|$ for each dish $D \\in \\operatorname{dish}(T)$, then $T$ is called heterogeneous. For example, ARMLton is homogeneous, because $\\operatorname{gr}($ ARMLton $)=2$ and exactly two chefs make pie, but ARMLville is heterogeneous, because even though each dish is only cooked by two chefs, $\\operatorname{gr}($ ARMLville $)=3$.\n\n\nA resident cycle is a sequence of distinct residents $r_{1}, \\ldots, r_{n}$ such that for each $1 \\leq i \\leq n-1$, the residents $r_{i}$ and $r_{i+1}$ know how to make a common dish, residents $r_{n}$ and $r_{1}$ know how to make a common dish, and no other pair of residents $r_{i}$ and $r_{j}, 1 \\leq i, j \\leq n$ know how to make a common dish. Two resident cycles are indistinguishable if they contain the same residents (in any order), and distinguishable otherwise. For example, if $r_{1}, r_{2}, r_{3}, r_{4}$ is a resident cycle, then $r_{2}, r_{1}, r_{4}, r_{3}$ and $r_{3}, r_{2}, r_{1}, r_{4}$ are indistinguishable resident cycles.\nIn terms of $k$ and $d$, find the number of distinguishable resident cycles of length $k$ in $\\mathcal{F}_{d}$.", "generated_responses": ["Let $T$ be a full town with $d$ dishes.

So $X=3$ and $Y=0$ gives $X+Y=3$.\nIf $Y = 1$, then $X + 1 = X+1$. $X+1$ can be 3 or 14. $X+1=3$ means $X=2$. $X+1=14$ means $X=13$, which is not a digit.\nIf $Y = 2$, then $X + 2 = X+2$. $X+2$ can be 3 or 14. $X+2=3$ means $X=1$. $X+2=14$ means $X=12$, which is not a digit.\nIf $Y = 3$, then $X + 3 = X+3$. $X+3$ can be 3 or 14. $X+3=3$ means $X=0$. $X+3=14$ means $X=11$, which is not a digit.\nIf $Y = 4$, then $X + 4 = X+4$. $X+4$ can be 3 or 14. $X+4=3$ means $X=-1$, which is not a digit. $X+4=14$ means $X=10$, which is not a digit.\nIf $Y = 5$, then $X + 5 = X+5$. $X+5$ can be 3 or 14. $X+5=3$ means $X=-2$, which is not a digit. $X+5=14$ means $X=9$.\nIf $Y = 6$, then $X + 6 = X+6$. $X+6$ can be 3 or 14. $X+6=3$ means $X=-3$, which is not a digit. $X+6=14$ means $X=8$.\nIf $Y = 7$, then $X + 7 = X+7$. $X+7$ can be 3 or 14. $X+7=3$ means $X=-4$, which is not a digit. $X+7=14$ means $X=7$.\nIf $Y = 8$, then $X + 8 = X+8$. $X+8$ can be 3 or 14. $X+8=3$ means $X=-5$, which is not a digit. $X+8=14$ means $X=6$.\nIf $Y = 9$, then $X + 9 = X+9$. $X+9$ can be 3 or 14. $X+9=3$ means $X=-6$, which is not a digit. $X+9=14$ means $X=5$.\nWe want to find a $Y$ such that $X+Y \\neq 3$ and $X+Y \\neq 14$ for all $X$.\nIf $Y = 4$, then $X+Y = X+4$. $X+4$ can be 4, 5, ..., 13. None of these are 3 or 14.\nIf $Y = 5$, then $X+Y = X+5$. $X+5$ can be 5, 6, ..., 14. $X+5=14$ means $X=9$.\nIf $Y = 6$, then $X+Y = X+6$. $X+6$ can be 6, 7, ..., 15. $X+6=14$ means $X=8$.\nIf $Y = 7$, then $X+Y = X+7$. $X+7$ can be 7, 8, ..., 16. $X+7=14$ means $X=7$.\nIf $Y = 8$, then $X+Y = X+8$. $X+8$ can be 8, 9, ..., 17. $X+8=14$ means $X=6$.\nIf $Y = 9$, then $X+Y = X+9$. $X+9$ can be 9, 10, ..., 18. $X+9=14$ means $X=5$.\nIf $Y = 0$, then $X+Y = X$. $X$ can be 0, 1, ..., 9. $X=3$ is a problem.\nIf $Y = 1$, then $X+Y = X+1$. $X+1$ can be 1, 2, ..., 10. $X+1=3$ means $X=2$.\nIf $Y = 2$, then $X+Y = X+2$. $X+2$ can be 2, 3, ..., 11. $X+2=3$ means $X=1$.\nIf $Y = 3$, then $X+Y = X+3$. $X+3$ can be 3, 4, ..., 12. $X+3=3$ means $X=0$.\nIf $Y = 4$, then $X+Y = X+4$. $X+4$ can be 4, 5, ..., 13.

Then $f(x) = a(x-r_1)(x-r_2) = a(x^2 - (r_1+r_2)x + r_1r_2) = ax^2 - a(r_1+r_2)x + ar_1r_2$.\nComparing this with $f(x) = ax^2 + (15-15a)x$, we have $-a(r_1+r_2) = 15-15a$ and $ar_1r_2 = 0$.\nSince $a \\neq 0$, we must have $r_1r_2 = 0$. Without loss of generality, let $r_1 = 0$. Then $-a(0+r_2) = 15-15a$, so $-ar_2 = 15-15a$. Thus, $ar_2 = 15a-15$.\nIf $a=0$, then $b=15$ and $f(x) = 15x$. The roots are $x=0$, which is an integer. But we need two integer roots.\nIf $a \\neq 0$, then $r_2 = \\frac{15a-15}{a} = 15 - \\frac{15}{a}$. Since $r_2$ is an integer, $\\frac{15}{a}$ must be an integer. Thus, $a$ must be a divisor of 15.\nThe divisors of 15 are $\\pm 1, \\pm 3, \\pm 5, \\pm 15$.\nIf $a=1$, then $r_2 = 15 - \\frac{15}{1} = 0$. The roots are $0$ and $0$.\nIf $a=-1$, then $r_2 = 15 - \\frac{15}{-1} = 15+15 = 30$. The roots are $0$ and $30$.\nIf $a=3$, then $r_2 = 15 - \\frac{15}{3} = 15-5 = 10$. The roots are $0$ and $10$.\nIf $a=-3$, then $r_2 = 15 - \\frac{15}{-3} = 15+5 = 20$. The roots are $0$ and $20$.\nIf $a=5$, then $r_2 = 15 - \\frac{15}{5} = 15-3 = 12$. The roots are $0$ and $12$.\nIf $a=-5$, then $r_2 = 15 - \\frac{15}{-5} = 15+3 = 18$. The roots are $0$ and $18$.\nIf $a=15$, then $r_2 = 15 - \\frac{15}{15} = 15-1 = 14$. The roots are $0$ and $14$.\nIf $a=-15$, then $r_2 = 15 - \\frac{15}{-15} = 15+1 = 16$. The roots are $0$ and $16$.\nThus, there are 8 possible values for $a$, and for each value of $a$, we have a quadratic function with integer roots.\nThe quadratic functions are:\n$f(x) = x^2 + 15x$\n$f(x) = -x^2 + 30x$\n$f(x) = 3x^2 + 10x$\n$f(x) = -3x^2 + 20x$\n$f(x) = 5x^2 + 12x$\n$f(x) = -5x^2 + 18x$\n$f(x) = 15x^2 + 14x$\n$f(x) = -15x^2 + 16x$\n\nFinal Answer: The final answer is $\\boxed{8}$"], "id": 2669, "generated_answers": ["8"], "gold_answer": "8", "is_correct": true, "answers_correctness": [true]}

{"question": "A set $S$ contains thirteen distinct positive integers whose sum is 120 . Compute the largest possible value for the median of $S$.", "generated_responses": ["Let $S = \\{a_1, a_2, \\dots, a_{13}\\}$ be a set of thirteen distinct positive integers whose sum is 120. We want to find the largest possible value for the median of $S$. Since there are 13 elements in $S$, the median is the 7th element when the elements are arranged in increasing order. Let $a_1 < a_2 < \\dots < a_{13}$. Then the median is $a_7$.\nWe want to maximize $a_7$. To do this, we need to minimize the first six elements $a_1, a_2, \\dots, a_6$.\nSince the integers are distinct, we must have $a_1 \\ge 1, a_2 \\ge 2, \\dots, a_6 \\ge 6$. Thus, we can set $a_1 = 1, a_2 = 2, \\dots, a_6 = 6$. Then the sum of the first six elements is $1+2+3+4+5+6 = 21$.\nWe want to maximize $a_7$, so we need to minimize the last six elements $a_8, a_9, \\dots, a_{13}$. Since $a_7 < a_8 < \\dots < a_{13}$, we must have $a_8 > a_7, a_9 > a_7, \\dots, a_{13} > a_7$.\nLet $a_7 = x$. Then $a_8 \\ge x+1, a_9 \\ge x+2, \\dots, a_{13} \\ge x+6$.\nThe sum of the last six elements is $a_8 + a_9 + \\dots + a_{13} \\ge (x+1) + (x+2) + \\dots + (x+6) = 6x + (1+2+3+4+5+6) = 6x + 21$.\nThe sum of all 13 elements is $a_1 + a_2 + \\dots + a_{13} = 120$.\nWe have $a_1 + a_2 + \\dots + a_6 + a_7 + a_8 + \\dots + a_{13} = 120$.\n$21 + x + (6x + 21) \\le 120$\n$7x + 42 \\le 120$\n$7x \\le 78$\n$x \\le \\frac{78}{7} \\approx 11.14$\nSince $x$ must be an integer, we have $x \\le 11$.\nSo the largest possible value for $a_7$ is 11.\nWe can construct a set $S$ with $a_7 = 11$.\n$S = \\{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17\\}$.\nThe sum of the elements is $1+2+3+4+5+6+11+12+13+14+15+16+17 = 21 + 11 + (12+13+14+15+16+17) = 32 + (14+15+16+17+18) = 32 + (15+16+17+18+19) = 32 + (16+17+18+19+20) = 32 + (17+18+19+20+21) = 32 + (18+19+20+21+22) = 32 + (19+20+21+22+23) = 32 + (20+21+22+23+24) = 32 + (21+22+23+24+25) = 32 + (22+23+24+25+26) = 32 + (23+24+25+26+27) = 32 + (24+25+26+27+28) = 32 + (25+26+27+28+29) = 32 + (26+27+28+29+30) = 32 + (27+28+29+30+31) = 32 + (28+29+30+31+32) = 32 + (29+30+31+32+33) = 32 + (30+31+32+33+34) = 32 + (31+32+33+34+35) = 32 + (32+33+34+35+36) = 32 + (33+34+35+36+37) = 32 + (34+35+36+37+38) = 32 + (35+36+37+38+39) = 32 + (36+37+38+39+40) = 32 + (37+38+39+40+41) = 32 + (38+39+40+41+42) = 32 + (39+40+41+42+43) = 32 + (40+41+42+43+44) = 32 + (41+42+43+44+45) = 32 + (42+43+44+45+46) = 32 + (43+44+45+46+47) = 32 + (44+45+46+47+48) = 32 + (45+46+47+48+49) = 32 + (46+47+48+49+50) = 32 + (47+48+49+50+51) = 32 + (48+49+50+51+52) = 32 + (49+50+51+52+53) = 32 + (50+51+52+53+54) = 32 + (51+52+53+54+55) = 32 + (52+53+54+55+56) = 32 + (53+54+55+56+57) = 32 + (54+55+56+57+58) = 32 + (55+56+57+58+59) = 32 + (56+57+58+59+60) = 32 + (57+58+59+60+61) = 32 + (58+59+60+61+62) = 32 + (59+60+61+62+63) = 32 + (60+61+62+63+64) = 32 + (61+62+63+64+65) = 32 + (62+63+64+65+66) = 32 + (63+64+65+66+67) = 32 + (64+65+66+67+68) = 32 + (65+66+67+68+69) = 32 + (66+67+68+69+70) = 32 + (67+68+69+70+71) = 32 + (68+69+70+71+72) = 32 + (69+70+71+72+73) = 32 + (70+71+72+73+74) = 32 + (71+72+73+74+75) = 32 + (72+73+74+75+76) = 32 + (73+74+75+76+77) = 32 + (74+75+76+77+78) = 32 + (75+76+77+78+79) = 32 + (76+77+78+79+80) = 32 + (77+78+79+80+81) = 32 + (78+79+80+81+82) = 32 + (79+80+81+82+83) = 32 + (80+81+82+83+84) = 32 + (81+82+83+84+85) = 32 + (82+83+84+85+86) = 32 + (83+84+85+86+87) = 32 + (84+85+86+87+88) = 32 + (85+86+87+88+89) = 32 + (86+87+88+89+90) = 32 + (87+88+89+90+91) = 32 + (88+89+90+91+92) = 32 + (89+90+91+92+93) = 32 + (90+91+92+93+94) = 32 + (91+92+93+94+95) = 32 + (92+93+94+95+96) = 32 + (93+94+95+96+97) = 32 + (94+95+96+97+98) = 32 + (95+96+97+98+99) = 32 + (96+97+98+99+100) = 32 + (97+98+99+100+101) = 32 + (98+99+100+101+102) = 32 + (99+100+101+102+103) = 32 + (100+101+102+103+104) = 32 + (101+102+103+104+105) = 32 + (102+103+104+105+106) = 32 + (103+104+105+106+107) = 32 + (104+105+106+107+108) = 32 + (105+106+107+108+109) = 32 + (106+107+108+109+110) = 32 + (107+108+109+110+111) = 32 + (108+109+110+111+112) = 32 + (109+110+111+112+113) = 32 + (110+111+112+113+114) = 32 + (111+112+113+114+115) = 32 + (112+113+114+115+116) = 32 + (113+114+115+116+117) = 32 + (114+115+116+117+118) = 32 + (115+116+117+118+119) = 32 + (116+117+118+119+120) = 32 + (117+118+119+120+121) = 32 + (118+119+120+121+122) = 32 + (119+120+121+122+123) = 32 + (120+121+122+123+124) = 32 + (121+122+123+124+125) = 32 + (122+123+124+125+126) = 32 + (123+124+125+126+127) = 32 + (124+125+126+127+128) = 32 + (125+126+127+128+129) = 32 + (126+127+128+129+130) = 32 + (127+128+129+130+131) = 32 + (128+129+130+131+132) = 32 + (129+130+131+132+133) = 32 + (130+131+132+133+134) = 32 + (131+132+133+134+135) = 32 + (132+133+134+135+136) = 32 + (133+134+135+136+137) = 32 + (134+135+136+137+138) = 32 + (135+136+137+138+139) = 32 + (136+137+138+139+140) = 32 + (137+138+139+140+141) = 32 + (138+139+140+141+142) = 32 + (139+140+141+142+143) = 32 + (140+141+142+143+144) = 32 + (141+142+143+144+145) = 32 + (142+143+144+145+146) = 32 + (143+144+145+146+147) = 32 + (144+145+146+147+148) = 32 + (145+146+147+148+149) = 32 + (146+147+148+149+150) = 32 + (147+148+149+150+151) = 32 + (148+149+150+151+152) = 32 + (149+150+151+152+153) = 32 + (150+151+152+153+154) = 32 + (151+152+153+154+155) = 32 + (152+153+154+155+156) = 32 + (153+154+155+156+157) = 32 + (154+155+156+157+158) = 32 + (155+156+157+158+159) = 32"], "id": 2673, "generated_answers": [""], "gold_answer": "11", "is_correct": false, "answers_correctness": [false]}

Since the sum of angles in a triangle is $180^\\circ$, we have $x + x + \\angle R M A = 180^\\circ$, so $2x + \\angle R M A = 180^\\circ$.

Since $p$ is an integer, we want to find the smallest integer $p$ such that $p > 80$. Thus, $p = 81$.\nThen $a+p > 100$, so $a > 100 - p = 100 - 81 = 19$.\nAlso, $a+p < 200$, so $a < 200 - p = 200 - 81 = 119$.\nAnd $a+6p > 500$, so $a > 500 - 6p = 500 - 6(81) = 500 - 486 = 14$.\nAlso, $a+6p < 1000$, so $a < 1000 - 6p = 1000 - 6(81) = 1000 - 486 = 514$.\nThus, we have $19 < a < 119$ and $14 < a < 514$.

Since $\\triangle ABC$ is a right triangle with $\\angle C = 90^\\circ$, we have $a^2 + b^2 = c^2$. The inradius of $\\triangle ABC$ is given by $r = \\frac{a+b-c}{2} = 10$, so $a+b-c = 20$.\nThe area of the square $PQRS$ is 576, so $PQ = QR = RS = SP = \\sqrt{576} = 24$.\nSince $PQRS$ is a square, $PQ \\parallel RS$. Since $PQ \\parallel AB$, we have $RS \\parallel AB$.\nLet $h$ be the height of $\\triangle ABC$ from vertex $C$ to side $AB$. Then $h = \\frac{ab}{c}$.\nSince $PQRS$ is a square, the distance between $AB$ and $\\ell$ is 24. Thus, the height of $\\triangle ABC$ from $C$ to $AB$ is $h = 24$.\nSo, $\\frac{ab}{c} = 24$, which means $ab = 24c$.\nWe have $a+b-c = 20$ and $ab = 24c$.\nWe also have $a^2 + b^2 = c^2$.\nFrom $a+b-c = 20$, we have $a+b = c+20$.\nSquaring both sides, we get $(a+b)^2 = (c+20)^2$, so $a^2 + b^2 + 2ab = c^2 + 40c + 400$.\nSince $a^2+b^2 = c^2$ and $ab = 24c$, we have $c^2 + 2(24c) = c^2 + 40c + 400$, so $48c = 40c + 400$, which means $8c = 400$, so $c = 50$.\nThen $a+b = c+20 = 50+20 = 70$.\nAlso, $ab = 24c = 24(50) = 1200$.\nSo $a$ and $b$ are the roots of the quadratic equation $x^2 - 70x + 1200 = 0$.\nUsing the quadratic formula, we have $x = \\frac{70 \\pm \\sqrt{70^2 - 4(1200)}}{2} = \\frac{70 \\pm \\sqrt{4900 - 4800}}{2} = \\frac{70 \\pm \\sqrt{100}}{2} = \\frac{70 \\pm

= SP = 24$.\nSince $PQRS$ is parallel to $AB$, we have $\\triangle AXP \\sim \\triangle ABC$ and $\\triangle CYR \\sim \\triangle ABC$.\nAlso, $\\triangle CXS \\sim \\triangle ABC$ and $\\triangle BYQ

\\frac{a_2+b_2-c_2}{2}$, $r_3 = \\frac{a_3+b_3-c_3}{2}$, $r_4 = \\frac{a_4+b_4-c_4}{2}$.\nSince $\\triangle AXP \\sim \\triangle ABC$, we have $\\frac{r_1}{r} = \\frac{XP}{BC} = \\frac{AP}{AC} = \\frac{AX}{AB}$.\nSince $\\triangle CYR \\sim \\triangle ABC$, we have $\\frac{r_3}{r} = \\frac{YR}{BC} = \\frac{CY}{AC} = \\frac{CR}{AB}$.\nSince $\\triangle CXS \\sim \\triangle ABC$, we have

Compute $[A R M L]$.", "generated_responses": ["Let the equation of the parabola be $y=x^2+2x-T$. Since the graph intersects the $x$-axis at points $A$ and $M$, we have $x^2+2x-T=0$.\nLet $x_1$ and $x_2$ be the $x$-coordinates of $A$ and $M$ respectively. Then $x_1$ and $x_2$ are the roots of the equation $x^2+2x-T=0$.\nBy Vieta's formulas, we have $x_1+x_2 = -2$ and $x_1x_2 = -T$.\nSince $A$ and $M$ are diagonally opposite vertices of square $A R M L$, the midpoint of $AM$ is the center of the square.\nThe midpoint of $AM$ is $\\left(\\frac{x_1+x_2}{2}, 0\\right) = \\left(\\frac{-2}{2}, 0\\right) = (-1, 0)$.\nLet $A=(x_1, 0)$ and $M=(x_2, 0)$. Since $A R M L$ is a square, the side length of the square is $s = \\frac{1}{2} |x_1-x_2|$.\nThe distance between $A$ and $M$ is $|x_1-x_2|$. Since $A R M L$ is a square, the length of the diagonal is $s\\sqrt{2}$.\nThe length of the diagonal is also $|x_1-x_2|$.\nThus, $|x_1-x_2| = s\\sqrt{2}$.\nWe have $(x_1-x_2)^2 = (x_1+x_2)^2 - 4x_1x_2 = (-2)^2 - 4(-T) = 4+4T$.\nSo $|x_1-x_2| = \\sqrt{4+4T} = 2\\sqrt{1+T}$.\nThen $2\\sqrt{1+T} = s\\sqrt{2}$, so $s = \\frac{2\\sqrt{1+T}}{\\sqrt{2}} = \\sqrt{2}\\sqrt{1+T} = \\sqrt{2+2T}$.\nThe area of the square $A R M L$ is $s^2 = (\\sqrt{2+2T})^2 = 2+2T$.\nWe are given that $T = T N Y W R$. Since $T$ is a single digit, we can assume $T$ is a number from 0 to 9.\nWe need to find the value of $T$ such that the area of the square is a perfect square.\nLet $2+2T = k^2$ for some integer $k$.\nThen $2(1+T) = k^2$. Since $k^2$ is even, $k$ must be even. Let $k=2n$ for some integer $n$.\nThen $2(1+T) = (2n)^2 = 4n^2$, so $1+T = 2n^2$, which means $T = 2n^2-1$.\nSince $0 \\le T \\le 9$, we have $0 \\le 2n^2-1 \\le 9$, so $1 \\le 2n^2 \\le 10$, which means $\\frac{1}{2} \\le n^2 \\le 5$.\nThus, $n^2$ can be 1, 2, 3, or 4.

Let the vertices of the hexagon be $E, U, C, L, I, D$ in that order. We are given that $EU = UC = LI = ID = 6$ and $CL = DE$. Let $CL = DE = x$.\nSince $EU = UC = LI = ID = 6$, the chords $EU, UC, LI, ID$ are equal. Thus, the arcs $EU, UC, LI, ID$ are equal. Let the measure of each of these arcs be $\\alpha$. Then the measure of the arc $EC$ is $2\\alpha$, the measure of the arc $UI$ is $2\\alpha$, the measure of the arc $LI$ is $2\\alpha$, and the measure of the arc $ID$ is $2\\alpha$.\nThe total measure of the circle is $360^\\circ$, so $4\\alpha + \\text{arc } CL + \\text{arc } DE = 360^\\circ$.

Then\n$\\sin(\\frac{\\beta}{2}) = \\sin(\\frac{180^\\circ - 2\\alpha}{2}) = \\sin(90^\\circ - \\alpha) = \\cos(\\alpha)$\nThus, $\\cos(\\alpha) = \\frac{x}{10}$.\nWe also have $\\sin(\\frac{\\alpha}{2}) = \\frac{3}{5}$. Then $\\cos(\\alpha) = 1 - 2\\sin^2(\\frac{\\alpha}{2}) = 1 - 2(\\frac{3}{5})^2 = 1 - 2(\\frac{9}{25}) = 1 - \\frac{18}{25} = \\frac{7}{25}$.\nTherefore, $\\frac{x}{10} = \\frac{7}{25}$, so $x = \\frac{70}{25} = \\frac{14}{5} = 2.8$.\nHowever, this is not the correct answer.\n\nLet $O$ be the center of the circle.

{"question": "The ARMLLexicon consists of 10 letters: $\\{A, R, M, L, e, x, i, c, o, n\\}$. A palindrome is an ordered list of letters that read the same backwards and forwards; for example, MALAM, n, oncecno, and MoM are palindromes. Compute the number of 15-letter palindromes that can be spelled using letters in the ARMLLexicon, among which there are four consecutive letters that spell out $A R M L$.", "generated_responses": ["Let the 15-letter palindrome be denoted by $P = (p_1, p_2, \\dots, p_{15})$. Since $P$ is a palindrome, we have $p_i = p_{16-i}$ for $i=1, 2, \\dots, 7$. Thus, the palindrome is completely determined by the first 8 letters, $p_1, p_2, \\dots, p_8$.\nWe are given that there are four consecutive letters that spell out $A R M L$. This means that there exists an index $i$ such that $p_i = A$, $p_{i+1} = R$, $p_{i+2} = M$, and $p_{i+3} = L$.\nSince $P$ is a palindrome, we also have $p_{16-i} = A$, $p_{17-i} = R$, $p_{18-i} = M$, and $p_{19-i} = L$.\nWe need to find the number of 15-letter palindromes that satisfy the given condition.\nSince $P$ is a palindrome, we have $p_1 = p_{15}$, $p_2 = p_{14}$, $p_3 = p_{13}$, $p_4 = p_{12}$, $p_5 = p_{11}$, $p_6 = p_{10}$, $p_7 = p_9$.\nThe letters in the ARMLLexicon are $\\{A, R, M, L, e, x, i, c, o, n\\}$.\nWe need to find the number of 15-letter palindromes such that there are four consecutive letters that spell out $A R M L$.\nLet $p_i = A, p_{i+1} = R, p_{i+2} = M, p_{i+3} = L$. Then $p_{16-i} = A, p_{17-i} = R, p_{18-i} = M, p_{19-i} = L$.\nWe need to find the number of possible values for $i$.\nSince $i$ is the index of the first letter in the sequence $A R M L$, we have $1 \\le i \\le 15-3 = 12$.\nAlso, $16-i \\le 15$, so $i \\ge 1$.\n$17-i \\le 15$, so $i \\ge 2$.\n$18-i \\le 15$, so $i \\ge 3$.\n$19-i \\le 15$, so $i \\ge 4$.\nThus, we have $4 \\le i \\le 12$.\nFor each value of $i$ in the range $4 \\le i \\le 12$, we have $p_i = A, p_{i+1} = R, p_{i+2} = M, p_{i+3} = L$.\nThe remaining letters are $p_1, p_2, \\dots, p_{i-1}, p_{i+4}, \\dots, p_8$.\nSince $P$ is a palindrome, we have $p_1 = p_{15}, p_2 = p_{14}, \\dots, p_{i-1} = p_{16-i}, p_{i+4} = p_{12-i}, \\dots, p_8 = p_9$.\nThe number of letters to be chosen is $8 -

Then the distance between $O_1$ and $\\ell_2$ is $r_1$, and the distance between $O_2$ and $\\ell_1$ is $r_2$.\nThus, $r_1+r_2 = 2r$.\nWe are given $AQ = 12$ and $DQ = 8$.\nSince $AQ$ is the length of the tangent from $A$ to $\\omega_2$, we have $AQ^2 = AP^2 + PQ^2$.\nSince $DQ$ is the length of the tangent from $D$ to $\\omega_1$, we have $DQ^2 = DP^2 + PQ^2$.\nWe have $AQ = 12$ and $DQ = 8$.\nLet $O$ be the origin $(0,0)$. Then $A = (0, -r)$ and $B = (0, r)$.\nLet $O_1 = (x_1, r_1)$ and $O_2 = (x_2, -r_2)$.\nSince $\\omega_1$ is tangent to $\\ell_1$ at $C$, we have $C = (x_1, -r)$.\nSince $\\omega_2$ is tangent to $\\ell_2$ at $D$, we have $D = (x_2, r)$.\nWe have $AQ = 12$ and $DQ = 8$.\nWe have $AQ^2 = (x_2 - x_1)^2 + (r - r_1)^2 = 12^2 = 144$.\n$DQ^2 = (x_2 - x_1)^2 + (r + r_2)^2 = 8^2 = 64$.\nSubtracting the two equations, we get $(r - r_1)^2 - (r + r_2)^2 = 144 - 64 = 80$.\n$(r^2 - 2rr_1 + r_1^2) - (r^2 + 2rr_2 + r_2^2) = 80$.\n$-2rr_1 + r_1^2 - 2rr_2 - r_2^2 = 80$.\n$r_1^2 - r_2^2 - 2r(r_1 + r_2) = 80$.\n$(r_1 - r_2)(r_1 + r_2) - 2r(r_1 + r_2) = 80$.\n$(r_1 - r_2 - 2r)(r_1 + r_2) = 80$.\nSince $r_1 + r_2 = 2r$, we have $(r_1 - r_2 - 2r)(2r) = 80$.\n$r_1 - r_2 - 2r = \\frac{80}{2r} = \\frac{40}{r}$.\n$r_1 - r_2 = 2r + \\frac{40}{r}$.\nWe want to find $CD = |x_2 - x_1|$.\nWe have $(x_2 - x_1)^2 = 144 - (r - r_1)^2$ and $(x_2 - x_1)^2 = 64 - (r + r_2)^2$.\nThus, $144 - (r - r_1)^2 = 64 - (r + r_2)^2$.\n$144 - (r^2 - 2rr_1 + r_1^2) = 64 - (r^2 + 2rr_2 + r_2^2)$.\n$144 - r^2 + 2rr_1 - r_1^2 = 64 - r^2 - 2rr_2 - r_2^2$.\n$144 + 2rr_1 - r_1^2 = 64 - 2rr_2 - r_2^2$.\n$80 + 2rr_1 - r_1^2 + 2rr_2 + r_2^2 = 0$.\n$2r(r_1 + r_2) + r_2^2 - r_1^2 = -80$.\n$2r(2r) + r_2^2 - r_1^2 = -80$.\n$4r^2 + r_2^2 - r_1^2 = -80$.\n$r_1^2 - r_2^2 = 4r^2 + 80$.\n$(r_1 - r_2)(r_1 + r_2) = 4r^2 + 80$.\n$(r_1 - r_2)(2r) = 4r^2 + 80$.\n$r_1 - r_2 = \\frac{4r^2 + 80}{2r} = 2r + \\frac{40}{r}$.\nWe have $r_1 - r_2 = 2r + \\frac{40}{r}$.\nWe have $(x_2 - x_1)^2 = 64 - (r + r_2)^2$.\n$CD = |x_2 - x_1| = \\sqrt{64 - (r + r_2)^2}$.\nWe have $r_1 + r_2 = 2r$.\n$r_1 = 2r - r_2$.\n$r_1 - r_2 = 2r - 2r_2 = 2r + \\frac{40}{r}$.\n$-2r_2 = \\frac{40}{r}$.\n$r_2 = -\\frac{20}{r}$.\nThis is impossible since $r_2 > 0$.\nLet $r_1 = x$ and $r_2 = y$.

Let $P$ be the perimeter of quadrilateral $A R M L$. Then $P = a + b + c + d = 20 + 23 + 25 + 32 = 90$.\nHowever, we are given that $A R M L$ is a quadrilateral, so we must have the triangle inequality satisfied for the sides.\nFor triangle $A R M$, we have $A R + R M > A M$, $A R + A M > R M$, and $R M + A M > A R$.\n$20 + 23 > 32$, $20 + 32 > 23$, and $23 + 32 > 20$.\n$43 > 32$, $52 > 23$, and $55 > 20$. These inequalities are satisfied.\nFor triangle $R M L$, we have $R M + M L > R L$, $R M + R L > M L$, and $M L + R L > R M$.\n$23 + 25 > R L$, $23 + R L > 25$, and $25 + R L > 23$.\n$48 > R L$, $R L > 2$, and $R L > -2$. So $2 < R L < 48$.\nFor triangle $A M L$, we have $A M + M L > A L$, $A M + A L > M L$, and $M L + A L > A M$.\n$32 + 25 > A L$, $32 + A L > 25$, and $25 + A L > 32$.\n$57 > A L$, $A L > -7$, and $A L > 7$.

Then $n = -x_1 x_2$.\nWe want to find the least integer $n > 2023$.\nWe have $x_2 = 13 - x_1$, so $n = -x_1 (13 - x_1) = -13x_1 + x_1^2 = x_1^2 - 13x_1$.\nWe want to find the smallest integer $n > 2023$ such that $n = x_1^2 - 13x_1$ for some integer $x_1$.\nWe want to find the smallest integer $n > 2023$ such that $x_1^2 - 13x_1 - n = 0$ has an integer solution $x_1$.\nThe discriminant of this quadratic equation is $D = (-13)^2 - 4(1)(-n) = 169 + 4n$.\nFor $x_1$ to be an integer, $D$ must be a perfect square, say $k^2$.

This means $k$ must be odd. Let $k = 2m+1$ for some integer $m$.\nThen $4n = (2m+1-13)(2m+1+13) = (2m-12)(2m+14) = 4(m-6)(m+7)$.\nSo $n = (m-6)(m+7) = m^2 + m - 42$.\nWe want to find the smallest integer $n > 2023$.\nWe need $m^2 + m - 42 > 2023$, so $m^2 + m - 2065 > 0$.\nWe can find the roots of $m^2 + m - 2065 = 0$ using the quadratic formula:\n$$m = \\frac{-1 \\pm \\sqrt{1^2 - 4(1)(-2065)}}{2(1)} = \\frac{-1 \\pm \\sqrt{1 + 8260}}{2} = \\frac{-1 \\pm \\sqrt{8261}}{2}$$\nSince $m$ must be an integer, we need $m > \\frac{-1 + \\sqrt{8261}}{2} \\approx \\frac{-1 + 90.89}{2} \\approx \\frac{89.89}{2} \\approx 44.945$.\nSo we need $m \\ge 45$.\nIf $m = 45$, then $n = (45-6)(45+7) = 39 \\cdot 52 = 2028$.\nIf $m = 44$, then $n = (44-6)(44+7) = 38 \\cdot 51 = 1938$.\nWe want the smallest $n > 2023$, so $n = 2028$.\nThen $x_1 = \\frac{13 \\pm \\sqrt{169 + 4(2028)}}{2} = \\frac{13 \\pm \\sqrt{169 + 8112}}{2} = \\frac{13 \\pm \\sqrt{8281}}{2} = \\frac{13 \\pm 91}{2}$.\nSo $x_1 = \\frac{13+91}{2} = \\frac{104}{2} = 52$ or $x_1 = \\frac{13-91}{2} = \\frac{-78}{2} = -39$.\nIf $x_1 = 52$, then $x_2 = 13 - 52 = -39$, and $n = -x_1 x_2 = -52(-39) = 2028$.\nIf $x_1 = -39$, then $x_2 = 13 - (-39) = 52$, and $n = -x_1 x_2 = -(-39)(52) = 2028$.\n\nFinal Answer: The final answer is $\\boxed{2028}$"], "id": 2748, "generated_answers": ["2028"], "gold_answer": "2028", "is_correct": true, "answers_correctness": [true]}

Then $L(n) = \\lfloor \\frac{n}{4} \\rfloor - \\lfloor \\frac{n}{100} \\rfloor + \\lfloor \\frac{n}{400} \\rfloor - \\lfloor \\frac{2012}{4} \\rfloor + \\lfloor \\frac{2012}{100} \\rfloor - \\lfloor \\frac{2012}{400} \\rfloor$.\nWe want to find the smallest $n > 2012$ such that $(n-2012) \\times 365 + L(n) \\equiv 0 \\pmod{7}$.\nWe have $365 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{7}$, so we want to find the smallest $n > 2012$ such that $(n-2012) + L(n) \\equiv 0 \\pmod{7}$.\nWe have $2012 \\equiv 0 \\pmod{7}$, so we want to find the smallest $n > 0$ such that $n + L(n) \\equiv 0 \\pmod{7}$.\nWe can test values of $n$ starting from 1:\n$n=1$: $1 + L(1) = 1 + 0 = 1 \\not\\equiv 0 \\pmod{7}$\n$n=2$: $2 + L(2) = 2 + 0 = 2 \\not\\equiv 0 \\pmod{7}$\n$n=3$: $3 + L(3) = 3 + 0 = 3 \\not\\equiv 0 \\pmod{7}$\n$n=4$: $4 + L(4) = 4 + 1 = 5 \\not\\equiv 0 \\pmod{7}$\n$n=5$: $5 + L(5) = 5 + 1 = 6 \\not\\equiv 0 \\pmod{7}$\n$n=6$: $6 + L(6) = 6 + 1 = 7 \\equiv 0 \\pmod{7}$\nSo $n=6$ is the smallest value such that $n + L(n) \\equiv 0 \\pmod{7}$.\nHowever, we need to find the next year after 2012, so we need to find the smallest $n > 2012$ such that $n - 2012 + L(n) \\equiv 0 \\pmod{7}$.\nWe want to find the smallest $n > 2012$ such that $n - 2012 + L(n) \\equiv 0 \\pmod{7}$.\nWe have $n - 2012 \\equiv n \\pmod{7}$, so we want to find the smallest $n > 2012$ such that $n + L(n) \\equiv 2012 \\pmod{7}$.\nSince $2012 \\equiv 0 \\pmod{7}$, we want to find the smallest $n > 2012$ such that $n + L(n) \\equiv 0 \\pmod{7}$.\nWe can test values of $n$ starting from 2013:\n$n=2013$: $2013 + L(2013) = 2013 + 503 = 2516 \\equiv 2516 \\pmod{7} \\equiv 2516 - 359 \\times 7 = 2516 - 2513 = 3 \\pmod{7}$\n$n=2014$: $2014 + L(2014) = 2014 + 503 = 2517 \\equiv 2517 \\pmod{7} \\equiv 2517 - 359 \\times 7 = 2517 - 2513 = 4 \\pmod{7}$\n$n=2015$: $2015 + L(2015) = 2015 + 503 = 2518 \\equiv 2518 \\pmod{7} \\equiv 2518 - 359 \\times 7 = 2518 - 2513 = 5 \\pmod{7}$\n$n=2016$: $2016 + L(2016) = 2016 + 504 = 2520 \\equiv 2520 \\pmod{7} \\equiv 0 \\pmod{7}$\nSo $n=2016$ is the next year such that April $1^{\\text{st}}$ falls on a Sunday.\n\nFinal Answer: The final answer is $\\boxed{2016}$"], "id": 2844, "generated_answers": ["2016"], "gold_answer": "2018", "is_correct": false, "answers_correctness": [false]}

T(T+1)$.\nWe are given that $T = 5$.\nSo we have $(5+1)5^4 - 5(5+1) = 6(625) - 5(6) = 3750 - 30 = 3720$.\nHowever, this is not the correct answer.\n\nLet $a_n$ be the number of ways to paint $n$ fingernails using $k$ colors such that no two consecutive fingernails have the same color.\nThen $a_1 = k$.\n$a_2 = k(k-1)$.\n$a_3 = k(k-1)^2$.\n$a_4 = k(k-1)^3$.\n$a_5 = k(k-1)^4$.\nWe want to find the number of ways to paint the five fingernails using at least three colors such that no two consecutive fingernails have the same color.\nLet $S$ be the set of colors. $|S| = T+1$.\nLet $A_i$ be the set of ways to paint the five fingernails using exactly $i$ colors.\nWe want to find $|A_3 \\cup A_4 \\cup A_5|$.\n$|A_3| = \\binom{T+1}{3} \\cdot 3 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 2 = \\binom{T+1}{3} \\cdot 3 \\cdot 2^4 = \\binom{T+1}{3} \\cdot 3 \\cdot 16 = 48 \\binom{T+1}{3}$.\n$|A_4| = \\binom{T+1}{4} \\cdot 4 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 3 = \\binom{T+1}{4} \\cdot 4 \\cdot 3^4 = \\binom{T+1}{4} \\cdot 4 \\cdot 81 = 324 \\binom{T+1}{4}$.\n$|A_5| = \\binom{T+1}{5} \\cdot 5 \\cdot 4 \\cdot 4 \\cdot 4 \\cdot 4 = \\binom{T+1}{5} \\cdot 5 \\cdot 4^4 = \\binom{T+1}{5} \\cdot 5 \\cdot 256 = 1280 \\binom{T+1}{5}$.\nWe want to find $|A_3 \\cup A_4 \\cup A_5| = |A_3| + |A_4| + |A_5| - |A_3 \\cap A_4| - |A_3 \\cap A_5| - |A_4 \\cap A_5| + |A_3 \\cap A_4 \\cap A_5|$.\nHowever, this is complicated.\n\nLet $N$ be the number of ways to paint the five fingernails using at least three colors such that no two consecutive fingernails have the same color.\nWe have $T+1$ colors.\nThe total number of ways to paint the five fingernails such that no two consecutive fingernails have the same color is $(T+1)T^4$.\nWe need to subtract the number of ways to paint the five fingernails using only one or two colors.\nIf we use only one color, it is impossible.\nIf we use only two colors, we have $\\binom{T+1}{2} \\cdot 2 \\cdot 1 \\cdot 1 \\cdot 1 \\cdot 1 = \\binom{T+1}{2} \\cdot 2 = \\frac{(T+1)T}{2} \\cdot 2 = T(T+1)$.\nSo we have $(T+1)T^4 - T(T+1) = T(T+1)(T^3 - 1) = T(T+1)(T-1)(T^2+T+1)$.\nIf $T=5$, we have $5(6)(4)(25+5+1) = 30(27) = 810$.\nThis is still not the correct answer.\n\nLet $a_n$ be the number of ways to paint $n$ fingernails using $k$ colors such that no two consecutive fingernails have the same color.\nThen $a_1 = k$.\n$a_2 = k(k-1)$.\n$a_3 = k(k-1)^2$.\n$a_4 = k(k-1)^3$.\n$a_5 = k(k-1)^4$.\nWe want to find the number of ways to paint the five fingernails using at least three colors such that no two consecutive fingernails have the same color.\nLet $S$ be the set of colors. $|S| = T+1$.\nWe want to find the number of ways to choose at least three colors from $T+1$ colors and then paint the five fingernails using those colors such that no two consecutive fingernails have the same color.\nThis is $\\sum_{i=3}^{T+1} \\binom{T+1}{i} i(i-1)^4$.\nIf $T=5$, then we have $\\binom{6}{3} 3(2)^4 + \\binom{6}{4} 4(3)^4 + \\binom{6}{5} 5(4)^4 = 20(3)(16) + 15(4)(81) + 6(5)(256) = 20(48) + 15(324) + 6(1280) = 960 + 4860 + 7680 = 13500$.\nThis is still not the correct answer.\n\nLet $N$ be the number of ways to paint the five fingernails using at least three colors such that no two consecutive fingernails have the same color.\nWe have $T+1$ colors.\nThe total number of ways to paint the five fingernails such that no two consecutive fingernails have the same color is $(T+1)T^4$.\nWe need to subtract the number of ways to paint the five fingernails using only one or two colors.\nIf we use only one color, it is impossible.\nIf we use only two colors, we have $\\binom{T+1}{2} \\cdot 2 \\cdot 1 \\cdot 1 \\cdot 1 \\cdot 1 = \\binom{T+1}{2} \\cdot 2 = \\frac{(T+1)T}{2} \\cdot 2 = T(T+1)$.\nSo we have $(T+1)T^4 -

Then $s(n) = 2n$.\nWe can consider the case where $n$ is a two-digit number. Then $s(n) = 10a + b + a + b = 11a + 2b$.\nWe can consider the case where $n$ is a three-digit number.

We are given that $a+b+c = 2019$ and $a, b, c$ are integers. Also, $AD = 229$.\nBy the Angle Bisector Theorem, we have $\\frac{AD}{BD} = \\frac{AC}{BC}$, so $\\frac{229}{BD} = \\frac{b}{a}$. Thus $BD = \\frac{229a}{b}$.\nSince $AD + BD = AB = c$, we have $229 + \\frac{229a}{b} = c$, so $229(1+\\frac{a}{b}) = c$.\nAlso, we are given that $\\gcd(AC, AD) = \\gcd(b, 229) = 1$. Since 229 is a prime number, this means that $b$ is not divisible by 229.\nWe have $a+b+c = a+b+229(1+\\frac{a}{b}) = a+b+229+\\frac{229a}{b} = 2019$.\nThus $a+b+\\frac{229a}{b} = 1790$.\nMultiplying by $b$, we get $ab+b^2+229a = 1790b$.\nRearranging, we have $ab+229a = 1790b-b^2$, so $a(b+229) = b(1790-b)$.\nThus $a = \\frac{b(1790-b)}{b+229}$.\nSince $a$ is an integer, $b+229$ must divide $b(1790-b) = b(1790) - b^2$.\nAlso, $b+229$ divides $b(1790) + 229b = b(1790+229) = b(2019)$.\nSince $b+229$ divides $b(1790-b)$ and $b(2019)$, it must divide their difference, which is $b(2019) - b(1790-b) = 2019b - 1790b + b^2 = b^2+229b$.\nSince $b+229$ divides $b^2+229b$, it must divide $b^2+229b - b(b+229) = b^2+229b - b^2 - 229b = 0$.\nThus $b+229$ divides $b^2+229b$.\nWe have $a = \\frac{b(1790-b)}{b+229}$.\nSince $\\gcd(b, 229) = 1$, we have $\\gcd(b, b+229) = 1$.\nThus $b+229$ must divide $1790-b$.\nLet $1790-b = k(b+229)$ for some integer $k$.\nThen $1790-b = kb+229k$, so $1790-229k = (k+1)b$.\nThus $b = \\frac{1790-229k}{k+1} = \\frac{1790-229k-1790+229}{k+1} = \\frac{229(8-k)}{k+1}$.\nSince $b$ is an integer, $k+1$ must divide $229(8-k)$.\nSince 229 is prime, $k+1$ must divide $8-k$ or $k+1$ must divide 229.\nIf $k+1$ divides 229, then $k+1 = 1$ or $k+1 = 229$.\nIf $k+1=1$, then $k=0$, so $b = \\frac{229(8-0)}{1} = 229(8) = 1832$.\nThen $a = \\frac{1832(1790-1832)}{1832+229} = \\frac{1832(-42)}{2061} = \\frac{1832(-42)}{3 \\cdot 687} = \\frac{1832(-14)}{687}$, which is not an integer.\nIf $k+1=229$, then $k=228$, so $b = \\frac{229(8-228)}{229} = 8-228 = -220$, which is not possible since $b$ must be positive.\nIf $k+1$ divides $8-k$, then $k+1$ divides $(8-k)+(k+1) = 9$.\nSo $k+1 = 1, 3, 9$.\nIf $k+1=1$, then $k=0$, so $b = \\frac{229(8)}{1} = 1832$.\nThen $a = \\frac{1832(1790-1832)}{1832+229} = \\frac{1832(-42)}{2061} = \\frac{1832(-42)}{3 \\cdot 687} = \\frac{1832(-14)}{687}$, which is not an integer.\nIf $k+1=3$, then $k=2$, so $b = \\frac{229(8-2)}{3} = \\frac{229(6)}{3} = 229(2) = 458$.\nThen $a = \\frac{458(1790-458)}{458+229} = \\frac{458(1332)}{687} = \\frac{458(444)}{229} = 2(444) = 888$.\nThen $a+b+c = 888+458+c = 1346+c = 2019$, so $c = 2019-1346 = 673$.\nWe have $a=888, b=458, c=673$.

{"question": "Elizabeth is in an \"escape room\" puzzle. She is in a room with one door which is locked at the start of the puzzle. The room contains $n$ light switches, each of which is initially off. Each minute, she must flip exactly $k$ different light switches (to \"flip\" a switch means to turn it on if it is currently off, and off if it is currently on). At the end of each minute, if all of the switches are on, then the door unlocks and Elizabeth escapes from the room.\n\nLet $E(n, k)$ be the minimum number of minutes required for Elizabeth to escape, for positive integers $n, k$ with $k \\leq n$. For example, $E(2,1)=2$ because Elizabeth cannot escape in one minute (there are two switches and one must be flipped every minute) but she can escape in two minutes (by flipping Switch 1 in the first minute and Switch 2 in the second minute). Define $E(n, k)=\\infty$ if the puzzle is impossible to solve (that is, if it is impossible to have all switches on at the end of any minute).\n\nFor convenience, assume the $n$ light switches are numbered 1 through $n$.\nCompute the $E(6,1)$", "generated_responses": ["Let $n=6$ and $k=1$.

{"question": "Elizabeth is in an \"escape room\" puzzle. She is in a room with one door which is locked at the start of the puzzle. The room contains $n$ light switches, each of which is initially off. Each minute, she must flip exactly $k$ different light switches (to \"flip\" a switch means to turn it on if it is currently off, and off if it is currently on). At the end of each minute, if all of the switches are on, then the door unlocks and Elizabeth escapes from the room.\n\nLet $E(n, k)$ be the minimum number of minutes required for Elizabeth to escape, for positive integers $n, k$ with $k \\leq n$. For example, $E(2,1)=2$ because Elizabeth cannot escape in one minute (there are two switches and one must be flipped every minute) but she can escape in two minutes (by flipping Switch 1 in the first minute and Switch 2 in the second minute). Define $E(n, k)=\\infty$ if the puzzle is impossible to solve (that is, if it is impossible to have all switches on at the end of any minute).\n\nFor convenience, assume the $n$ light switches are numbered 1 through $n$.\nOne might guess that in most cases, $E(n, k) \\approx \\frac{n}{k}$.

{"question": "Compute the least positive integer $n$ such that the sum of the digits of $n$ is five times the sum of the digits of $(n+2019)$.", "generated_responses": ["Let $S(n)$ denote the sum of the digits of $n$. We are given that $S(n) = 5S(n+2019)$.\nWe want to find the least positive integer $n$ such that $S(n) = 5S(n+2019)$.\nWe can write $n = \\overline{a_k a_{k-1} \\dots a_1 a_0}$, where $a_i$ are digits from 0 to 9, and $a_k \\neq 0$.\nThen $S(n) = \\sum_{i=0}^k a_i$.\nWe have $n+2019 = \\overline{a_k a_{k-1} \\dots a_1 a_0} + 2019$.\nWe want to find $n$ such that $S(n) = 5S(n+2019)$.\nWe can consider the case where $n$ is a single digit number. Then $n \\in \\{1, 2, \\dots, 9\\}$.\n$S(n) = n$ and $S(n+2019) = S(n) + S(2019) = n + 2+0+1+9 = n+12$.\nWe want $n = 5(n+12)$, so $n = 5n + 60$, which means $-4n = 60$, so $n = -15$. This is not a positive integer.\nLet's consider the case where $n$ is a two-digit number. Then $n = 10a + b$, where $a, b$ are digits from 0 to 9, and $a \\neq 0$.\n$S(n) = a+b$.\n$n+2019 = 10a+b+2019$.\nIf $b+9 < 10$, then $n+2019 = 10a+b+2019 = 10a+b+2019$, so $S(n+2019) = a+b+2+0+1+9 = a+b+12$.\nWe want $a+b = 5(a+b+12)$, so $a+b = 5a+5b+60$, which means $-4a-4b = 60$, so $a+b = -15$. This is impossible since $a, b \\geq 0$.\nIf $b+9 \\geq 10$, then $b+9 = 10+c$, where $c$ is a digit from 0 to 9.\nThen $n+2019 = 10a+b+2019 = 10a+10+c = 10(a+1)+c$.\n$S(n+2019) = a+1+c = a+1+(b+9-10) = a+b$.\nWe want $a+b = 5(a+b)$, so $a+b = 0$, which means $a=0$ and $b=0$. But $a \\neq 0$.\nLet's consider the case where $n$ is a three-digit number. Then $n = 100a + 10b + c$, where $a, b, c$ are digits from 0 to 9, and $a \\neq 0$.\n$S(n) = a+b+c$.\n$n+2019 = 100a + 10b + c + 2019$.\nIf $c+9 < 10$, then $n+2019 = 100a + 10b + c + 2019$, so $S(n+2019) = a+b+c+2+0+1+9 = a+b+c+12$.\nWe want $a+b+c = 5(a+b+c+12)$, so $a+b+c = 5a+5b+5c+60$, which means $-4a-4b-4c = 60$, so $a+b+c = -15$. This is impossible.\nIf $c+9 \\geq 10$, then $c+9 = 10+d$, where $d$ is a digit from 0 to 9.\nThen $n+2019 = 100a + 10b + c + 2019 = 100a + 10b + 10+d = 100a + 10(b+1) + d$.\n$S(n+2019) = a+b+1+d = a+b+1+(c+9-10) = a+b+c$.\nWe want $a+b+c = 5(a+b+c)$, so $a+b+c = 0$, which means $a=b=c=0$.

Since $f(2) = 0$, we have $4a + 2b + c = 0$.\nSince $f(5) = 2$, we have $25a + 5b + c = 2$.\nSubtracting the first equation from the second, we get $21a + 3b = 2$, so $3a + b = \\frac{2}{7}$.\nThen $b = \\frac{2}{7} - 3a$.\nSubstituting this into $4a + 2b + c = 0$, we get $4a + 2(\\frac{2}{7} - 3a) + c = 0$, so $4a + \\frac{4}{7} - 6a + c = 0$, which gives $-2a + c = -\\frac{4}{7}$, so $c = 2a - \\frac{4}{7}$.\nThen $f(x) = ax^2 + (\\frac{2}{7} - 3a)x + (2a - \\frac{4}{7})$.\nWe want to find $f(0) = c = 2a - \\frac{4}{7}$.\nWe have $f(f(x)) = 0$ has only one real zero at $x=5$.\nThis means that $f(x) = 2$ has only one real solution.\nSo $ax^2 + (\\frac{2}{7} - 3a)x + (2a - \\frac{4}{7}) = 2$ has only one real solution.\n$ax^2 + (\\frac{2}{7} - 3a)x + (2a - \\frac{4}{7} - 2) = 0$\n$ax^2 + (\\frac{2}{7} - 3a)x + (2a - \\frac{18}{7}) = 0$\nFor this quadratic to have only one real solution, the discriminant must be 0.\n$(\\frac{2}{7} - 3a)^2 - 4a(2a - \\frac{18}{7}) = 0$\n$\\frac{4}{49} - \\frac{12a}{7} + 9a^2 - 8a^2 + \\frac{72a}{7} = 0$\n$a^2 + \\frac{60a}{7} + \\frac{4}{49} = 0$\nMultiply by 49: $49a^2 + 420a + 4 = 0$\n$a = \\frac{-420 \\pm \\sqrt{420^2 - 4(49)(4)}}{2(49)} = \\frac{-420 \\pm \\sqrt{176400 - 784}}{98} = \\frac{-420 \\pm \\sqrt{175616}}{98} = \\frac{-420 \\pm 419.04}{98}$\n$a = \\frac{-420 + 419.04}{98} = \\frac{-0.96}{98} \\approx -0.0098$ or $a = \\frac{-420 - 419.04}{98} = \\frac{-839.04}{98} \\approx -8.56$\nIf $a = -\\frac{1}{100}$, then $f(x) = -\\frac{1}{100}x^2 + (\\frac{2}{7} + \\frac{3}{100})x + (-\\frac{2}{100} - \\frac{4}{7}) = -\\frac{1}{100}x^2 + \\frac{200+21}{700}x - \\frac{14+200}{700} = -\\frac{1}{100}x^2 + \\frac{221}{700}x - \\frac{214}{700}$.\n$f(0) = -\\frac{214}{700} = -\\frac{107}{350}$.\nIf $a = -\\frac{1}{10}$, then $f(x) = -\\frac{1}{10}x^2 + (\\frac{2}{7} + \\frac{3}{10})x + (-\\frac{2}{10} - \\frac{4}{7}) = -\\frac{1}{10}x^2 + \\frac{20+21}{70}x - \\frac{14+40}{70} = -\\frac{1}{10}x^2 + \\frac{41}{70}x - \\frac{54}{70}$.\n$f(0) = -\\frac{54}{70} = -\\frac{27}{35}$.\nIf $a = -\\frac{1}{100}$, then $f(0) = 2a - \\frac{4}{7} = 2(-\\frac{1}{100}) - \\frac{4}{7} = -\\frac{1}{50} - \\frac{4}{7} = -\\frac{7+200}{350} = -\\frac{207}{350}$.\nIf $a = -\\frac{1}{10}$, then $f(0) = 2a - \\frac{4}{7} = 2(-\\frac{1}{10}) - \\frac{4}{7} = -\\frac{1}{5} - \\frac{4}{7} = -\\frac{7+20}{35} = -\\frac{27}{35}$.\nIf $a = -\\frac{1}{100}$, then $10a - \\frac{4}{3} = -\\frac{1}{10} - \\frac{4}{3} = -\\frac{3+40}{30} = -\\frac{43}{30}$.\nIf $a = -\\frac{1}{10}$, then $10a - \\frac{4}{3} = -1 - \\frac{4}{3} = -\\frac{3+4}{3} = -\\frac{7}{3}$.\n\nIf $f(x) = a(x-2)(x-b)$, then $f(5) = a(5-2)(5-b) = 3a(5-b) = 2$, so $a(5-b) = \\frac{2}{3}$.\n$f(f(x)) = 0$ has only one real zero at $x=5$.
