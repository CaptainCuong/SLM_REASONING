We can pad the integers with leading zeros to obtain a binary string of length 2017.\nFor example, the integer 5 can be represented as $101_2$, which can be written as $000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000"], "id": 1612, "generated_answers": [""], "gold_answer": "$2^{1009}$", "is_correct": false, "answers_correctness": [false]}

Suppose we have a unique partition of the board into dominoes. Each domino covers two cells. The total number of cells in the board is $(2n)^2 = 4n^2$. Since each domino covers two cells, the number of dominoes is $\\frac{4n^2}{2} = 2n^2$. If we mark $k$ cells, then the number of unmarked cells is $4n^2 - k$.

If we mark 4 cells, then there is no way to partition the board into dominoes. So we need to mark 1 cell.\nIf we mark 1 cell, say (1,1), then the only possible dominoes are (1,1)(1,2) and (1,1)(2,1).

(For example, the process starting with THT would be THT $\\rightarrow H H T \\rightarrow H T T \\rightarrow T T T$, which takes three steps.)\n\nLetting $C$ denote the initial configuration (a sequence of $n H$ 's and $T$ 's), write $\\ell(C)$ for the number of steps needed before all coins show $T$. Show that this number $\\ell(C)$ is finite, and determine its average value over all $2^{n}$ possible initial configurations $C$.", "generated_responses": ["Let $C$ be an initial configuration of $n$ coins, where each coin is either heads (H) or tails (T). We define $\\ell(C)$ as the number of steps needed before all coins show tails. We want to show that $\\ell(C)$ is finite for any initial configuration $C$, and determine the average value of $\\ell(C)$ over all $2^n$ possible initial configurations.\n\nLet $k_i$ be the number of heads in the configuration after the $i$-th step. We start with $k_0$ heads in the initial configuration $C$. In the first step, we flip the $k_0$-th coin. If the $k_0$-th coin is heads, we flip it to tails, so the number of heads decreases by 1. If the $k_0$-th coin is tails, we flip it to heads, so the number of heads increases by 1. In either case, $|k_1 - k_0| = 1$.\n\nIn the second step, we flip the $k_1$-th coin. Again, the number of heads changes by 1, so $|k_2 - k_1| = 1$. In general, $|k_{i+1} - k_i| = 1$ for all $i \\ge 0$.\n\nWe want to show that $\\ell(C)$ is finite. Since $k_i$ is the number of heads after the $i$-th step, $0 \\le k_i \\le n$ for all $i$. We want to find the number of steps until $k_i = 0$.\nWe can think of $k_i$ as a random walk on the integers from 0 to $n$. We start at $k_0$, and at each step, we move up or down by 1. We want to find the expected number of steps to reach 0.\nLet $E_k$ be the expected number of steps to reach 0, starting from $k$ heads. We want to find $E_{k_0}$.\nWe have the recurrence relation $E_k = 1 + \\frac{1}{2} E_{k-1} + \\frac{1}{2} E_{k+1}$ for $1 \\le k \\le n-1$. Also, $E_0 = 0$ and $E_n = 1 + \\frac{1}{2} E_{n-1} + \\frac{1}{2} E_{n+1}$. Since $E_{n+1}$ is not defined, we consider the case when we have $n$ heads. In this case, we flip the $n$-th coin, so we have $n-1$ heads. Thus, $E_n = 1 + E_{n-1}$.\nWe can rewrite the recurrence relation as $E_{k+1} - 2E_k + E_{k-1} = -2$.\nThe characteristic equation is $r^2 - 2r + 1 = 0$, which gives $(r-1)^2 = 0$, so $r=1$ is a repeated root. Thus, the general solution is $E_k = c_1 + c_2 k$.\nWe have $E_0 = 0$, so $c_1 = 0$. Then $E_k = c_2 k$.\nWe also have $E_n = 1 + E_{n-1}$, so $c_2 n = 1 + c_2 (n-1)$. This gives $c_2 n = 1 + c_2 n - c_2$, so $c_2 = 1$.\nThus, $E_k = k$.\nHowever, this is incorrect.

{"question": "On a $999 \\times 999$ board a limp rook can move in the following way: From any square it can move to any of its adjacent squares, i.e. a square having a common side with it, and every move must be a turn, i.e. the directions of any two consecutive moves must be perpendicular. A nonintersecting route of the limp rook consists of a sequence of pairwise different squares that the limp rook can visit in that order by an admissible sequence of moves.

Let $p = 2q+1$.\nThen $(2q+1)^2 = 4q^2 + 4q + 1 = 2n+1$, so $2n = 4q^2 + 4q$, which means $n = 2q^2 + 2q$.\n$m = 10p = 10(2q+1) = 20q+10$.\n$k = \\frac{2500 - (20q+10)^2}{200} = \\frac{2500 - (400q^2 + 400q + 100)}{200} = \\frac{2400 - 400q^2 - 400q}{200} = 12 - 2q^2 - 2q$.\n$a+b = 50-2k = 50 - 2(12-2q^2-2q) = 50 - 24 + 4q^2 + 4q = 26 + 4q^2 + 4q$.\n$ab = k^2 = (12-2q^2-2q)^2$.\nWe want $a<b$, so we need $a = \\frac{26+4q^2+4q - \\sqrt{(26+4q^2+4q)^2 - 4(12-2q^2-2q)^2}}{2}$ and $b = \\frac{26+4q^2+4q + \\sqrt{(26+4q^2+4q)^2 - 4(12-2q^2-2q)^2}}{2}$.\nIf $q=0$, then $k=12$, $a+b = 26$, $ab = 144$.\n$a, b$ are roots of $x^2 - 26x + 144 = 0$, so $(x-8)(x-18) = 0$. Thus $(a,b)=(8,18)$.\nIf $q=1$, then $k=8$, $a+b = 34$, $ab = 64$.\n$a, b$ are roots of $x^2 - 34x + 64 = 0$, so $(x-2)(x-32) = 0$. Thus $(a,b)=(2,32)$.\nIf $q=2$, then $k=0$, $a+b = 38$, $ab = 0$.\nThis is not possible since $a, b > 0$.\nIf $q=3$, then $k=-10$, $a+b = 46$, $ab = 100$.\n$a, b$ are roots of $x^2 - 46x + 100 = 0$, so $x = \\frac{46 \\pm \\sqrt{46^2 - 400}}{2} = \\frac{46 \\pm \\sqrt{2116-400}}{2} = \\frac{46 \\pm \\sqrt{1716}}{2}$, which is not an integer.\n\nThus, the two pairs of positive integers $(a, b)$ with $a<b$ that satisfy the equation are $(2, 32)$ and $(8, 18)$.\n\nFinal Answer: The final answer is $\\boxed{(2, 32), (8, 18)}$"], "id": 2544, "generated_answers": ["(2, 32), (8, 18)"], "gold_answer": "(2,32), (8,18)", "is_correct": true, "answers_correctness": [true]}

Then $2a^2 = 4p^2 + 4q^2$, so $a^2 = 2p^2 + 2q^2$.\nIf $m$ and $n$ are both odd, let $m = 2p+1$ and $n = 2q+1$. Then $2a^2 = (2p+1)^2 + (2q+1)^2 = 4p^2 + 4p + 1 + 4q^2 + 4q + 1 = 4(p^2 + p + q^2 + q) + 2$, so $a^2 = 2(p^2 + p + q^2 + q) + 1$, which is odd.\nThen $a$ is odd, and $a^2 - 1 = 2(p^2 + p + q^2 + q)$, so $a^2 - 1 = 2(p(p+1) + q(q+1))$.\nWe want to find $q$ such that $x^2 + 4x + q = 0$ and $x^2 + 4x - q = 0$ have integer solutions.\nThe discriminants are $16 - 4q$ and $16 + 4q$.\nWe need $16 - 4q \\ge 0$ and $16 + 4q \\ge 0$, so $-4 \\le q \\le 4$.\nWe want only one of $16 - 4q$ and $16 + 4q$ to be a perfect square.\nIf $16 - 4q = k^2$, then $4(4 - q) = k^2$, so $4 - q = (\\frac{k}{2})^2$.\nIf $16 + 4q = l^2$, then $4(4 + q) = l^2$, so $4 + q = (\\frac{l}{2})^2$.\nIf $q = 5$, then $16 - 4(5) = -4$, which is not a perfect square.\n$16 + 4(5) = 36 = 6^2$.\nIf $q = -5$, then $16 - 4(-5) = 36 = 6^2$.\n$16 + 4(-5) = -4$, which is not a perfect square.\nThus, $q = 5$.\n\nFinal Answer: The final answer is $\\boxed{5}$"], "id": 2565, "generated_answers": ["5"], "gold_answer": "$\\frac{a b}{2}$", "is_correct": false, "answers_correctness": [false]}

In base 20, $105 = 5 \\cdot 20 + 5$, so $105_{10} = 55_{20}$. In base 14, $105 = 7 \\cdot 14 + 7$, so $105_{10} = 77_{14}$. Since $77_{14}$ is a palindrome, $N=105$ is a palindrome in both base 20 and base 14.\n\nNow we check if there is a smaller palindrome in base 20 that is also a palindrome in base 14.\nIf $N = a_0$, then $N$ is a single digit in both bases, so $N$ is a palindrome in both bases. But $N > 20$, so $N \\ge 21$.\nIf $N = a_1 20 + a_0$, then $N$ is a two-digit number in base 20. We want $a_1 = a_0$, so $N = a(20+a)$ for $a \\in \\{1, 2, \\dots, 19\\}$. We want $N > 20$, so $a(20+a) > 20$. We found $a=5$ gives $N=105$.\nIf $N = a_2 20^2 + a_1 20 + a_0$, then $N$ is a three-digit number in base 20. We want $a_2 = a_0$, so $N = a_2 20^2 + a_1 20 + a_2$. We want $N > 20$.\n$N = a_2 (20^2+1) + a_1 (20) = 401 a_2 + 20 a_1$.\nIf $a_2 = 1$, then $N = 401 + 20 a_1$. We want $N > 20$, so $401 + 20 a_1 > 20$, which is always true. We want $N$ to be a palindrome in base 14.\n$N = 401 + 20 a_1 = 28 \\cdot 14 + 9 + 20 a_1$.\nIf $a_1 = 0$, $N = 401 = 28 \\cdot 14 + 9$, so $N = 289_{14}$.

{"question": "In each town in ARMLandia, the residents have formed groups, which meet each week to share math problems and enjoy each others' company over a potluck-style dinner. Each town resident belongs to exactly one group. Every week, each resident is required to make one dish and to bring it to his/her group.\n\nIt so happens that each resident knows how to make precisely two dishes. Moreover, no two residents of a town know how to make the same pair of dishes. Shown below are two example towns. In the left column are the names of the town's residents. Adjacent to each name is the list of dishes that the corresponding resident knows how to make.\n\n| ARMLton |  |\n| :--- | :--- |\n| Resident | Dishes |\n| Paul | pie, turkey |\n| Arnold | pie, salad |\n| Kelly | salad, broth |\n\n\n| ARMLville |  |\n| :--- | :--- |\n| Resident | Dishes |\n| Sally | steak, calzones |\n| Ross | calzones, pancakes |\n| David | steak, pancakes |\n\nThe population of a town $T$, denoted $\\operatorname{pop}(T)$, is the number of residents of $T$. Formally, the town itself is simply the set of its residents, denoted by $\\left\\{r_{1}, \\ldots, r_{\\mathrm{pop}(T)}\\right\\}$ unless otherwise specified. The set of dishes that the residents of $T$ collectively know how to make is denoted $\\operatorname{dish}(T)$. For example, in the town of ARMLton described above, pop(ARMLton) $=3$, and dish(ARMLton) $=$ \\{pie, turkey, salad, broth\\}.\n\nA town $T$ is called full if for every pair of dishes in $\\operatorname{dish}(T)$, there is exactly one resident in $T$ who knows how to make those two dishes. In the examples above, ARMLville is a full town, but ARMLton is not, because (for example) nobody in ARMLton knows how to make both turkey and salad.\n\nDenote by $\\mathcal{F}_{d}$ a full town in which collectively the residents know how to make $d$ dishes. That is, $\\left|\\operatorname{dish}\\left(\\mathcal{F}_{d}\\right)\\right|=d$.\n\nIn order to avoid the embarrassing situation where two people bring the same dish to a group dinner, if two people know how to make a common dish, they are forbidden from participating in the same group meeting. Formally, a group assignment on $T$ is a function $f: T \\rightarrow\\{1,2, \\ldots, k\\}$, satisfying the condition that if $f\\left(r_{i}\\right)=f\\left(r_{j}\\right)$ for $i \\neq j$, then $r_{i}$ and $r_{j}$ do not know any of the same recipes. The group number of a town $T$, denoted $\\operatorname{gr}(T)$, is the least positive integer $k$ for which there exists a group assignment on $T$.\n\nFor example, consider once again the town of ARMLton. A valid group assignment would be $f($ Paul $)=f($ Kelly $)=1$ and $f($ Arnold $)=2$. The function which gives the value 1 to each resident of ARMLton is not a group assignment, because Paul and Arnold must be assigned to different groups.\n\n\nFor a dish $D$, a resident is called a $D$-chef if he or she knows how to make the dish $D$. Define $\\operatorname{chef}_{T}(D)$ to be the set of residents in $T$ who are $D$-chefs. For example, in ARMLville, David is a steak-chef and a pancakes-chef. Further, $\\operatorname{chef}_{\\text {ARMLville }}($ steak $)=\\{$ Sally, David $\\}$.\n\n\nIf $\\operatorname{gr}(T)=\\left|\\operatorname{chef}_{T}(D)\\right|$ for some $D \\in \\operatorname{dish}(T)$, then $T$ is called homogeneous. If $\\operatorname{gr}(T)>\\left|\\operatorname{chef}_{T}(D)\\right|$ for each dish $D \\in \\operatorname{dish}(T)$, then $T$ is called heterogeneous. For example, ARMLton is homogeneous, because $\\operatorname{gr}($ ARMLton $)=2$ and exactly two chefs make pie, but ARMLville is heterogeneous, because even though each dish is only cooked by two chefs, $\\operatorname{gr}($ ARMLville $)=3$.\n\n\nA resident cycle is a sequence of distinct residents $r_{1}, \\ldots, r_{n}$ such that for each $1 \\leq i \\leq n-1$, the residents $r_{i}$ and $r_{i+1}$ know how to make a common dish, residents $r_{n}$ and $r_{1}$ know how to make a common dish, and no other pair of residents $r_{i}$ and $r_{j}, 1 \\leq i, j \\leq n$ know how to make a common dish. Two resident cycles are indistinguishable if they contain the same residents (in any order), and distinguishable otherwise. For example, if $r_{1}, r_{2}, r_{3}, r_{4}$ is a resident cycle, then $r_{2}, r_{1}, r_{4}, r_{3}$ and $r_{3}, r_{2}, r_{1}, r_{4}$ are indistinguishable resident cycles.\nIn terms of $k$ and $d$, find the number of distinguishable resident cycles of length $k$ in $\\mathcal{F}_{d}$.", "generated_responses": ["Let $T$ be a full town with $d$ dishes.

Each resident knows two dishes. The total number of dish-resident pairs is $2 \\binom{d}{2}$. The number of dishes is $d$.

Then we can assign each dish to a group. For example, if $d=3$, then we have 3 dishes $D_1, D_2, D_3$. The residents are $r_{12}, r_{13}, r_{23}$. We can assign $r_{12}$ to group 1, $r_{13}$ to group 2, $r_{23}$ to group 3.\nThe number of distinguishable resident cycles of length $k$ is $\\frac{1}{k} \\sum_{d|k} \\phi(d) \\binom{k/d}{2}^{k/d}$.\n\nThe number of residents is $\\binom{d}{2}$.

This means that there exists a non-negative integer $n$ such that $k + nk^2 = 306$.\nWe can rewrite this equation as $k(1+nk) = 306$. Since $k$ is a positive integer, $k$ must be a divisor of 306.

Then $x = -y^2 - 14 = -(-1)^2 - 14 = -1 - 14 = -15$.\nSo $(x, y, z) = (-15, -1, -1)$.\nNow we check the original equations:\n$xy - z^2 = (-15)(-1) - (-1)^2 = 15 - 1 = 14$.\n$y^2 z - x = (-1)^2 (-1) - (-15) = -1 + 15 = 14$.\nThus, $(x, y, z) = (-15, -1, -1)$ is a solution.\n\nIf $y = 1$, then $z(y^3 - z) = 14(1 + 1) = 28$, so $z(1 - z) = 28$, which means $z - z^2 = 28$, or $z^2 - z + 28 = 0$.\nThe discriminant is $(-1)^2 - 4(1)(28) = 1 - 112 = -111 < 0$, so there are no real solutions.\n\nIf $x = 0$, then $0 - z^2 = 14$, which is impossible.\nIf $y = 0$, then $0 - z^2 = 14$, which is impossible.\nIf $z = 0$, then $xy = 14$ and $-x = 14$, so $x = -14$ and $y = -1$. This gives $(x, y, z) = (-14, -1, 0)$.\n\nWe want to find the farthest lattice point from the origin.\nThe distance from the origin is $\\sqrt{x^2 + y^2 + z^2}$.\nFor $(x, y, z) = (-14, -1, 0)$, the distance is $\\sqrt{(-14)^2 + (-1)^2 + 0^2} = \\sqrt{196 + 1} = \\sqrt{197} \\approx 14.036$.\nFor $(x, y, z) = (-15, -1, -1)$, the distance is $\\sqrt{(-15)^2 + (-1)^2 + (-1)^2} = \\sqrt{225 + 1 + 1} = \\sqrt{227} \\approx 15.066$.\n\nConsider $x = 14, y = 1$. Then $14 - z^2 = 14$, so $z^2 = 0$, $z = 0$. Also, $1^2(0) - 14 = 14$, which is false.\nConsider $x = -14, y = -1$. Then $(-14)(-1) - z^2 = 14$, so $14 - z^2 = 14$, which means $z^2 = 0$, so $z = 0$. Also, $(-1)^2(0) - (-14) = 14$, so $14 = 14$. Thus, $(x, y, z) = (-14, -1, 0)$ is a solution.\nThe distance is $\\sqrt{(-14)^2 + (-1)^2 + 0^2} = \\sqrt{196 + 1} = \\sqrt{197} \\approx 14.036$.\n\nConsider $x = -15, y = -1$. Then $(-15)(-1) - z^2 = 14$, so $15 - z^2 = 14$, which means $z^2 = 1$, so $z = \\pm 1$. Also, $(-1)^2 z - (-15) = 14$, so $z + 15 = 14$, which means $z = -1$. Thus, $(x, y, z) = (-15, -1, -1)$ is a solution.\nThe distance is $\\sqrt{(-15)^2 + (-1)^2 + (-1)^2} = \\sqrt{225 + 1 + 1} = \\sqrt{227} \\approx 15.066$.\n\nLet $x = 1, y = 1$. Then $1 - z^2 = 14$, so $z^2 = -13$, which is impossible.\nLet $x = 2, y = 1$. Then $2 - z^2 = 14$, so $z^2 = -12$, which is impossible.\n\nWe want to maximize $x^2 + y^2 + z^2$ subject to $xy - z^2 = 14$ and $y^2 z - x = 14$.\nFrom $xy - z^2 = 14$, we have $z^2 = xy - 14$.\nFrom $y^2 z - x = 14$, we have $y^2 z = x + 14$.\nThen $z = \\frac{x + 14}{y^2}$.\nSubstituting into $z^2 = xy - 14$, we get $\\left(\\frac{x + 14}{y^2}\\right)^2 = xy - 14$.\n$\\frac{(x + 14)^2}{y^4} = xy - 14$.\n$(x + 14)^2 = y^4(xy - 14)$.\n$x^2 + 28x + 196 = y^4 xy - 14y^4$.\n$x^2 + 28x + 196 = xy^5 - 14y^4$.\n$x^2 + 28x + 196 + 14y^4 = xy^5$.\n$x^2 + 28x + 196 + 14y^4 = xy^5$.\n\nFinal Answer: The final answer is $\\boxed{(-15, -1, -1)}$"], "id": 2647, "generated_answers": ["(-15, -1, -1)"], "gold_answer": "$(-266,-3,-28)$", "is_correct": false, "answers_correctness": [false]}

Thus, $N = 70l$ for some integer $l$.\nWe want the smallest positive integer $N$, so we take $l=1$, which gives $N=70$.\nWe check that $20N = 20(70) = 1400$, which is a multiple of 14 since $1400 = 14 \\cdot 100$.\nAlso, $14N = 14(70) = 980$, which is a multiple of 20 since $980 = 20 \\cdot 49$.\nThus, $N=70$ satisfies the given conditions.\n\nWe can also write the conditions as\n$20N \\equiv 0 \\pmod{14}$\n$14N \\equiv 0 \\pmod{20}$\nFrom the first congruence, $20N = 14k$ for some integer $k$. This simplifies to $10N = 7k$. Since $\\gcd(10, 7) = 1$, we must have $N \\equiv 0 \\pmod{7}$.\nFrom the second congruence, $14N = 20m$ for some integer $m$. This simplifies to $7N = 10m$. Since $\\gcd(7, 10) = 1$, we must have $N \\equiv 0 \\pmod{10}$.\nThus, $N$ is a multiple of 7 and 10. The least common multiple of 7 and 10 is 70. Therefore, $N$ is a multiple of 70.\nThe smallest positive integer $N$ is 70.\n\nFinal Answer: The final answer is $\\boxed{70}$"], "id": 2662, "generated_answers": ["70"], "gold_answer": "70", "is_correct": true, "answers_correctness": [true]}

{"question": "In ARMLopolis, every house number is a positive integer, and City Hall's address is 0. However, due to the curved nature of the cowpaths that eventually became the streets of ARMLopolis, the distance $d(n)$ between house $n$ and City Hall is not simply the value of $n$. Instead, if $n=3^{k} n^{\\prime}$, where $k \\geq 0$ is an integer and $n^{\\prime}$ is an integer not divisible by 3 , then $d(n)=3^{-k}$. For example, $d(18)=1 / 9$ and $d(17)=1$. Notice that even though no houses have negative numbers, $d(n)$ is well-defined for negative values of $n$. For example, $d(-33)=1 / 3$ because $-33=3^{1} \\cdot-11$. By definition, $d(0)=0$. Following the dictum \"location, location, location,\" this Power Question will refer to \"houses\" and \"house numbers\" interchangeably.\n\nCuriously, the arrangement of the houses is such that the distance from house $n$ to house $m$, written $d(m, n)$, is simply $d(m-n)$. For example, $d(3,4)=d(-1)=1$ because $-1=3^{0} \\cdot-1$. In particular, if $m=n$, then $d(m, n)=0$.\n\n\nThe neighborhood of a house $n$, written $\\mathcal{N}(n)$, is the set of all houses that are the same distance from City Hall as $n$. In symbols, $\\mathcal{N}(n)=\\{m \\mid d(m)=d(n)\\}$. Geometrically, it may be helpful to think of $\\mathcal{N}(n)$ as a circle centered at City Hall with radius $d(n)$.\n\nLater, ARMLopolis finally decides on a drastic expansion plan: now house numbers will be rational numbers. To define $d(p / q)$, with $p$ and $q$ integers such that $p q \\neq 0$, write $p / q=3^{k} p^{\\prime} / q^{\\prime}$, where neither $p^{\\prime}$ nor $q^{\\prime}$ is divisible by 3 and $k$ is an integer (not necessarily positive); then $d(p / q)=3^{-k}$.\nCompute $d(3 / 5), d(5 / 8)$, and $d(7 / 18)$.", "generated_responses": ["Let $n = \\frac{p}{q}$ be a rational number, where $p$ and $q$ are integers such that $pq \\neq 0$.

Let $s = \\frac{a+b+c}{2}$ be the semi-perimeter of $\\triangle ABC$. The area of $\\triangle ABC$ is $\\frac{1}{2}ab$. The inradius of $\\triangle ABC$ is given by $r = \\frac{\\text{Area}}{s} = \\frac{\\frac{1}{2}ab}{\\frac{a+b+c}{2}} = \\frac{ab}{a+b+c} = 10$.\nThe area of square $PQRS$ is 576, so $PQ = QR = RS = SP = \\sqrt{576} = 24$.\nSince $PQ \\parallel AB$, $\\triangle CPQ \\sim \\triangle CAB$. Let $h$ be the height from $C$ to $AB$. Then $\\frac{PQ}{AB} = \\frac{h'}{h}$, where $h'$ is the height from $C$ to $PQ$.\nSince $PQRS$ is a square, $C$ is between $R$ and $S$, and $PQ \\parallel AB$, we have $h' = \\frac{1}{2}h$. Thus, $\\frac{24}{c} = \\frac{h'}{h} = \\frac{1}{2}$, so $c = 48$.\nAlso, the area of $\\triangle ABC$ is $\\frac{1}{2}ab = \\frac{1}{2}ch$, so $ab = ch = 48h$.\nSince $r = \\frac{ab}{a+b+c} = 10$, we have $ab = 10(a+b+c) = 10(a+b+48)$.\nWe have $ab = 48h$, so $48h = 10(a+b+48)$, which means $h = \\frac{10(a+b+48)}{48} = \\frac{5(a+b+48)}{24}$.\nAlso, $a^2 + b^2 = c^2 = 48^2 = 2304$.\nWe have $h = \\frac{ab}{c} = \\frac{ab}{48}$, so $\\frac{5(a+b+48)}{24} = \\frac{ab}{48}$, which means $10(a+b+48) = ab$.\nWe have $a+b = \\sqrt{(a+b)^2} = \\sqrt{a^2+b^2+2ab} = \\sqrt{2304+2ab}$.\nThen $10(\\sqrt{2304+2ab}+48) = ab$.\nLet $ab = x$. Then $10(\\sqrt{2304+2x}+48) = x$, so $10\\sqrt{2304+2x} = x-480$.\nSquaring both sides, we get $100(2304+2x) = (x-480)^2$, so $230400+200x = x^2-960x+230400$.\nThen $x^2-1160x = 0$, so $x(x-1160) = 0$. Since $x \\neq 0$, we have $x = 1160$.\nThus, $ab = 1160$.\nNow, $a+b = \\sqrt{2304+2(1160)} = \\sqrt{2304+2320} = \\sqrt{4624} = 68$.\nSo $a+b = 68$ and $ab = 1160$.

We have $PQ = 24$. Since $PQ \\parallel AB$, $\\triangle CPQ \\sim \\triangle CAB$. Let $h$ be the altitude from $C$ to $AB$. Then $\\frac{PQ}{AB} = \\frac{h'}{h}$, where $h'$ is the altitude from $C$ to $PQ$. Since $C$ is between $R$ and $S$, we have $h' = \\frac{1}{2}h$. Thus, $\\frac{24}{AB} = \\frac{1}{2}$, so $AB = 48$.\nThe area of $\\triangle ABC$ is $\\frac{1}{2} \\cdot 48 \\cdot h = 24h$. Also, the area is $\\frac{1}{2}ab$.\nSince $r = 10$, we have $\\frac{1}{2}ab = 10(a+b+48)$, so $ab = 20(a+b+48)$.\nWe have $a^2+b^2 = 48^2 = 2304$. Also, $h = \\frac{ab}{48}$.\nSince $PQRS$ is a square, $PQ = QR = 24$. Since $PQ \\parallel AB$, $\\triangle CPQ \\sim \\triangle CAB$. Thus, $\\frac{CP}{CA} = \\frac{CQ}{CB} = \\frac{PQ}{AB} = \\frac{24}{48} = \\frac{1}{2}$.\nSo $CP = \\frac{1}{2}a$ and $CQ = \\frac{1}{2}b$.\nSince $C$ is between $R$ and $S$, we have $CR = CS = 24$.\nIn $\\triangle AXP$, $XP = \\frac{1}{2}PS = \\frac{1}{2} \\sqrt{24^2+AC^2} = \\frac{1}{2} \\sqrt{576+a^2}$.\nSince $PQRS$ is a square, $PS = 24$.

Then $t = \\frac{3 + \\lfloor t^2 \\rfloor}{4}$.\nThus, $4t = 3 + \\lfloor t^2 \\rfloor$, so $4t - 3 = \\lfloor t^2 \\rfloor$.\nSince $\\lfloor t^2 \\rfloor$ is an integer, $4t - 3$ must be an integer. Let $4t - 3 = n$, where $n$ is an integer. Then $4t = n + 3$, so $t = \\frac{n+3}{4}$.\nWe have $\\lfloor t^2 \\rfloor = \\lfloor \\left(\\frac{n+3}{4}\\right)^2 \\rfloor = \\lfloor \\frac{n^2 + 6n + 9}{16} \\rfloor = n$.\nThus, $n \\le \\frac{n^2 + 6n + 9}{16} < n+1$.\nMultiplying by 16, we have $16n \\le n^2 + 6n + 9 < 16n + 16$.\nFrom $16n \\le n^2 + 6n + 9$, we have $0 \\le n^2 - 10n + 9 = (n-1)(n-9)$. Thus, $n \\le 1$ or $n \\ge 9$.\nFrom $n^2 + 6n + 9 < 16n + 16$, we have $n^2 - 10n - 7 < 0$.\nThe roots of $n^2 - 10n - 7 = 0$ are $n = \\frac{10 \\pm \\sqrt{100 - 4(-7)}}{2} = \\frac{10 \\pm \\sqrt{128 + 4}}{2} = \\frac{10 \\pm \\sqrt{132}}{2} = 5 \\pm \\sqrt{33}$.\nSince $\\sqrt{33} \\approx 5.74$, we have $5 - \\sqrt{33} \\approx -0.74$ and $5 + \\sqrt{33} \\approx 10.74$.\nThus, we need $-0.74 < n < 10.74$.\nCombining the inequalities, we have $n \\in \\{-1, 0, 1, 9, 10\\}$.\nIf $n = -1$, then $t = \\frac{-1+3}{4} = \\frac{2}{4} = \\frac{1}{2}$. Then $\\lfloor t^2 \\rfloor = \\lfloor \\frac{1}{4} \\rfloor = 0$, but $n = -1$.\nIf $n = 0$, then $t = \\frac{0+3}{4} = \\frac{3}{4}$. Then $\\lfloor t^2 \\rfloor = \\lfloor \\frac{9}{16} \\rfloor = 0$, and $n = 0$. So $t = \\frac{3}{4}$ is a solution.\nIf $n = 1$, then $t = \\frac{1+3}{4} = \\frac{4}{4} = 1$. Then $\\lfloor t^2 \\rfloor = \\lfloor 1 \\rfloor = 1$, and $n = 1$. So $t = 1$ is a solution.\nIf $n = 9$, then $t = \\frac{9+3}{4} = \\frac{12}{4} = 3$. Then $\\lfloor t^2 \\rfloor = \\lfloor 9 \\rfloor = 9$, and $n = 9$. So $t = 3$ is a solution.\nIf $n = 10$, then $t = \\frac{10+3}{4} = \\frac{13}{4} = 3.25$. Then $\\lfloor t^2 \\rfloor = \\lfloor (3.25)^2 \\rfloor = \\lfloor 10.5625 \\rfloor = 10$, and $n = 10$. So $t = \\frac{13}{4}$ is a solution.\nThe values of $t$ are $\\frac{3}{4}, 1, 3, \\frac{13}{4}$.\nSince $x = 10^t$, the values of $x$ are $10^{3/4}, 10^1, 10^3, 10^{13/4}$.\nThe product of these values is $10^{3/4} \\cdot 10^1 \\cdot 10^3 \\cdot 10^{13/4} = 10^{3/4 + 1 + 3 + 13/4} = 10^{(3+4+12+13)/4} = 10^{32/4} = 10^8$.\nThus, $y = 8$.\n\nFinal Answer: The final answer is $\\boxed{8}$"], "id": 2738, "generated_answers": ["8"], "gold_answer": "8", "is_correct": true, "answers_correctness": [true]}

We have the conditions $d_k \\geq k$ for $k=1, 2, \\dots, 8$.\nLet $S = \\{1, 2, \\dots, 9\\}$. We want to choose 8 distinct digits from $S$ such that $d_1 \\geq 1, d_2 \\geq 2, \\dots, d_8 \\geq 8$.\nLet $x_k = d_k - k$. Then $x_k \\geq 0$ for all $k=1, 2, \\dots, 8$.\nAlso, $d_1 + d_2 + \\dots + d_8 = (x_1+1) + (x_2+2) + \\dots + (x_8+8) = (x_1 + x_2 + \\dots + x_8) + (1+2+\\dots+8) = (x_1 + x_2 + \\dots + x_8) + 36$.\nSince the digits are distinct and from the set $\\{1, 2, \\dots, 9\\}$, we have $d_1 + d_2 + \\dots + d_8 \\leq 1+2+\\dots+9 = 45$.\nThus, $(x_1 + x_2 + \\dots + x_8) + 36 \\leq 45$, which means $x_1 + x_2 + \\dots + x_8 \\leq 9$.\nSince $x_k \\geq 0$ for all $k$, we want to find the number of non-negative integer solutions to $x_1 + x_2 + \\dots + x_8 \\leq 9$.\nThis is equivalent to finding the number of non-negative integer solutions to $x_1 + x_2 + \\dots + x_8 + x_9 = 9$, where $x_9$ is a slack variable.\nThe number of solutions is given by $\\binom{9+9-1}{9} = \\binom{17}{9} = \\frac{17!}{9!8!} = \\frac{17 \\cdot 16 \\cdot 15 \\cdot 14 \\cdot 13 \\cdot 12 \\cdot 11 \\cdot 10}{8 \\cdot 7 \\cdot 6 \\cdot 5 \\cdot 4 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 1} = 17 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 15 \\cdot 14 \\cdot 13 \\cdot 12 \\cdot 11 \\cdot 10 / (8 \\cdot 7 \\cdot 6 \\cdot 5 \\cdot 4 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 2) = 17 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 13 \\cdot 11 = 24310$.\nHowever, we need to choose 8 distinct digits from $\\{1, 2, \\dots, 9\\}$.\nLet $y_i = 9 - d_{9-i}$ for $i=1, 2, \\dots, 8$. Then $y_i$ are distinct digits from $\\{1, 2, \\dots, 9\\}$.\nSince $d_k \\geq k$, we have $9 - d_{9-k} \\leq 9 - k$, so $y_i \\leq 9 - i$.\nWe want to choose 8 distinct digits $y_1, y_2, \\dots, y_8$ from $\\{1, 2, \\dots, 9\\}$ such that $y_i \\leq 9-i$.\nThe condition $y_i \\leq 9-i$ means $y_1 \\leq 8, y_2 \\leq 7, y_3 \\leq 6, y_4 \\leq 5, y_5 \\leq 4, y_6 \\leq 3, y_7 \\leq 2, y_8 \\leq 1$.\nSince $y_1, y_2, \\dots, y_8$ are distinct, we must have $y_1 < y_2 < \\dots < y_8$. Thus, $y_1 \\leq 8, y_2 \\leq 7, \\dots, y_8 \\leq 1$.\nThis implies $y_1 \\leq 8, y_2 \\leq 7, \\dots, y_8 \\leq 1$. Since $y_1 < y_2 < \\dots < y_8$, we must have $y_1 \\leq 1, y_2 \\leq 2, \\dots, y_8 \\leq 8$.\nWe need to choose 8 distinct digits from $\\{1, 2, \\dots, 9\\}$ such that $y_1 \\leq 8, y_2 \\leq 7, \\dots, y_8 \\leq 1$.\nThis is equivalent to choosing 8 digits from $\\{1, 2, \\dots, 9\\}$ such that $y_1 \\leq 8, y_2 \\leq 7, \\dots, y_8 \\leq 1$.\nWe can choose the digits in reverse order. Let $z_i = 9 - y_i$. Then $z_1, z_2, \\dots, z_8$ are distinct digits from $\\{1, 2, \\dots, 9\\}$ such that $z_1 \\geq 1, z_2 \\geq 2, \\dots, z_8 \\geq 8$.\nThe number of ways to choose 8 distinct digits from $\\{1, 2, \\dots, 9\\}$ is $\\binom{9}{8} = 9$.\nWe need to arrange the digits such that $d_k \\geq k$ for all $k=1, 2, \\dots, 8$.\nThe number of permutations of 8 digits is $8! = 40320$.\nWe need to find the number of permutations of 8 digits such that $d_k \\geq k$ for all $k=1, 2, \\dots, 8$.\nThe number of such permutations is the number of standard Young tableaux of shape $(8, 1)$, which is $\\frac{9!}{8!1!} = 9$.\nThe number of valid license plates is $\\binom{9}{8} \\times 1 = 9$.\n\nWe want to choose 8 distinct digits from $\\{1, 2, \\dots, 9\\}$ such that $d_k \\geq k$ for $k=1, 2, \\dots, 8$.\nLet $x_i = d_i - i$. Then $x_i \\geq 0$ for all $i=1, 2, \\dots, 8$.\nAlso, $d_1 + d_2 + \\dots + d_8 = (x_1+1) + (x_2+2) + \\dots + (x_8+8) = (x_1 + x_2 + \\dots + x_8) + 36$.\nSince $d_1, \\dots, d_8$ are distinct digits from $\\{1, 2, \\dots, 9\\}$, we have $d_1 + \\dots + d_8 \\leq 1+2+\\dots+9 = 45$.\nThus, $(x_1 + x_2 + \\dots + x_8) + 36 \\leq 45$, which means $x_1 + x_2 + \\dots + x_8 \\leq 9$.\nThe number of non-negative integer solutions to $x_1 + x_2 + \\dots + x_8 \\leq 9$ is the same as the number of non-negative integer solutions to $x_1 + x_2 + \\dots + x_8 + x_9 = 9$, which is $\\binom{9+9-1}{9} = \\binom{17}{9} = 24310$.\nHowever, we need to choose 8 distinct digits from $\\{1, 2, \\dots, 9\\}$.\nThe number of ways to choose 8 digits from $\\{1, 2, \\dots, 9\\}$ is $\\binom{9}{8} = 9$.\nThe number of ways to arrange the 8 chosen digits such that $d_k \\geq k$ is 1.\nThus, the number of valid license plates is $\\binom{9}{8} \\times 1 = 9$.\n\nThe number of valid license plates is $\\binom{9}{8} \\times 8! = 9 \\times 40320 = 362880$.\nThe number of ways to choose 8 digits from $\\{1, 2, \\dots, 9\\}$ is $\\binom{9}{8} = 9$.\nThe number of ways to arrange the 8 chosen digits such that $d_k \\geq k$ is 1.\nThus, the number of valid license plates is $\\binom{9}{8} \\times 1 = 9$.\n\nWe need to choose 8 distinct digits from $\\{1, 2, \\dots, 9\\}$ such that $d_k \\geq k$ for all $k=1, 2, \\dots, 8$.\nLet $x_i = d_i - i$.

This means $N \\equiv 0 \\pmod{3}$ and $N \\equiv 0 \\pmod{11}$.\nSince $N$ is divisible by 3, the sum of its digits must be divisible by 3.\nSince $N$ is divisible by 11, the alternating sum of its digits must be divisible by 11.\n\nWe want to find the smallest $T$-digit number divisible by 33.\nIf $T=1$, the smallest 1-digit number divisible by 33 is 33, which is not a 1-digit number.\nIf $T=2$, the smallest 2-digit number divisible by 33 is 33.\nIf $T=3$, the smallest 3-digit number divisible by 33 is 165.\nIf $T=4$, the smallest 4-digit number divisible by 33 is 1023.\nIf $T=5$, the smallest 5-digit number divisible by 33 is 10023.\n\nWe want to find the smallest $T$-digit number $N$ such that $N \\equiv 0 \\pmod{33}$.\nWe can write $N = 33k$ for some integer $k$.\nWe want to find the smallest $k$ such that $33k$ is a $T$-digit number.\nWe have $10^{T-1} \\le 33k < 10^T$.\nSo $\\frac{10^{T-1}}{33} \\le k < \\frac{10^T}{33}$.\nWe want to find the smallest integer $k$ such that $k \\ge \\frac{10^{T-1}}{33}$.\nThen $N = 33k = 33 \\lceil \\frac{10^{T-1}}{33} \\rceil$.\n\nLet's consider the case where $T=2$.

Let's try to find a $T$ such that the last two digits of $N$ are $a$ and $b$ with $ab = 54$.\nThe possible pairs of digits are (6, 9), (9, 6), (2, 27), (27, 2), (1, 54), (54, 1), etc. Since we are looking for digits, we only consider (6, 9) and (9, 6).\nLet's try $T=2$. Then $N=33$. The last two digits are 3 and 3, so $3 \\times 3 = 9$.\nLet's try $T=3$. Then $N=132$. The last two digits are 3 and 2, so $3 \\times 2 = 6$.\nLet's try $T=4$. Then $N=1023$. The last two digits are 2 and 3, so $2 \\times 3 = 6$.\nLet's try $T=5$. Then $N=10032$. The last two digits are 3 and 2, so $3 \\times 2 = 6$.\nLet's try $T=6$. Then $N = 33 \\lceil \\frac{100000}{33} \\rceil = 33 \\lceil 3030.3 \\rceil = 33 \\times 3031 = 100023$. The last two digits are 2 and 3, so $2 \\times 3 = 6$.\n\nWe need to find a $T$ such that the last two digits of $N$ are 6 and 9 or 9 and 6.\nLet $N = 33k$. We want the last two digits to be 69 or 96.\nIf $N \\equiv 69 \\pmod{100}$, then $33k \\equiv 69 \\pmod{100}$.

Let $A, R, M, L$ be the midpoints of $P_1P_2, P_2P_3, P_3P_4, P_4P_1$ respectively. The area of the square is 650, so the side length of the square is $\\sqrt{650} = \\sqrt{25 \\cdot 26} = 5\\sqrt{26}$.\nSince $A, R, M, L$ are midpoints of the sides of the square, the quadrilateral $ARML$ is a square. The side length of $ARML$ is $\\frac{1}{2}$ the length of the diagonal of the original square. The diagonal of the original square is $\\sqrt{2} \\cdot 5\\sqrt{26} = 5\\sqrt{52} = 5\\sqrt{4 \\cdot 13} = 10\\sqrt{13}$.

Then $AP = \\sqrt{(x-0)^2 + (y-1)^2} = 1$ and $BP = \\sqrt{(x-1)^2 + (y-1)^2} = 1$.\nSquaring both equations, we have $x^2 + (y-1)^2 = 1$ and $(x-1)^2 + (y-1)^2 = 1$.\nSubtracting the first equation from the second, we get $(x-1)^2 - x^2 = 0$, which simplifies to $x^2 - 2x + 1 - x^2 = 0$, so $-2x+1=0$, which means $x = \\frac{1}{2}$.\nSubstituting $x=\\frac{1}{2}$ into $x^2 + (y-1)^2 = 1$, we get $\\frac{1}{4} + (y-1)^2 = 1$, so $(y-1)^2 = \\frac{3}{4}$.\nThus, $y-1 = \\pm \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}$, so $y = 1 \\pm \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}$.\nSince $P$ is in the interior of the square, we must have $0 < y < 1$, so $y = 1 - \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}$.\nTherefore, $P = (\\frac{1}{2}, 1 - \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2})$.\nSimilarly, for $\\triangle BCQ$, $BQ=CQ=BC=1$.\nLet $Q=(x,y)$. Then $BQ = \\sqrt{(x-1)^2 + (y-1)^2} = 1$ and $CQ = \\sqrt{(x-1)^2 + (y-0)^2} = 1$.\nSquaring both equations, we have $(x-1)^2 + (y-1)^2 = 1$ and $(x-1)^2 + y^2 = 1$.\nSubtracting the second equation from the first, we get $(y-1)^2 - y^2 = 0$, which simplifies to $y^2 - 2y + 1 - y^2 = 0$, so $-2y+1=0$, which means $y = \\frac{1}{2}$.\nSubstituting $y=\\frac{1}{2}$ into $(x-1)^2 + y^2 = 1$, we get $(x-1)^2 + \\frac{1}{4} = 1$, so $(x-1)^2 = \\frac{3}{4}$.\nThus, $x-1 = \\pm \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}$, so $x = 1 \\pm \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}$.\nSince $Q$ is in the interior of the square, we must have $0 < x < 1$, so $x = 1 - \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}$.\nTherefore, $Q = (1 - \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}, \\frac{1}{2})$.\nFor $\\triangle CDR$, $CR=DR=CD=1$.\nLet $R=(x,y)$.

Since $R$ is in the interior of the square, we must have $0 < y < 1$, so $y = \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}$.\nTherefore, $R = (\\frac{1}{2}, \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2})$.\nFor $\\triangle DAS$, $DS=AS=DA=1$.\nLet $S=(x,y)$.

Then $S = x y E E$, where $x, y \\in \\{A, B, \\ldots, Z\\}$. There are $26 \\times 26 = 26^2$ possibilities.\nThe total number of possibilities is $6 \\times 26^2 = 6 \\times 676 = 4056$.\nHowever, we have double-counted some words.\nFor example, consider the word $E E E E$. This word is counted in all 6 cases.\nConsider the word $E x E E$. This word is counted in cases 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6.\nConsider the word $E E x E$. This word is counted in cases 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6.\nConsider the word $E E E x$. This word is counted in cases 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6.\nConsider the word $E E E E$. This word is counted in cases 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6.\n\nWe can also think of the problem as follows:\nWe want to choose two positions for the $E$'s. There are $\\binom{4}{2} = 6$ ways to choose the positions of the $E$'s.\nFor the remaining two positions, we can choose any of the 26 letters. So there are $26^2 = 676$ ways to fill the remaining positions.\nThus, the total number of words is $6 \\times 26^2 = 6 \\times 676 = 4056$.\n\nHowever, this is not the correct answer.\nLet's consider the total number of four-letter words, which is $26^4 = 456976$.\nLet's consider the number of four-letter words that do not contain the letter $E$. This is $25^4 = 390625$.\nThen the number of four-letter words that contain at least one $E$ is $26^4 - 25^4 = 456976 - 390625 = 66351$.\nLet's consider the number of four-letter words that contain exactly one $E$. We choose one position for the $E$, and the other three positions can be any of the other 25 letters. So there are $\\binom{4}{1} \\times 25^3 = 4 \\times 15625 = 62500$.\nLet's consider the number of four-letter words that contain exactly two $E$'s. We choose two positions for the $E$'s, and the other two positions can be any of the other 25 letters. So there are $\\binom{4}{2} \\times 25^2 = 6 \\times 625 = 3750$.\nLet's consider the number of four-letter words that contain exactly three $E$'s. We choose three positions for the $E$'s, and the other one position can be any of the other 25 letters. So there are $\\binom{4}{3} \\times 25^1 = 4 \\times 25 = 100$.\nLet's consider the number of four-letter words that contain exactly four $E$'s. There is only one such word, $E E E E$.\nThe total number of words is $62500 + 3750 + 100 + 1 = 66351$.\n\nWe want to count the number of four-letter words that contain $E E$ as a subsequence.\nLet $a_n$ be the number of $n$-letter words that contain $E E$ as a subsequence.\nWe can derive a recurrence relation for $a_n$.\nIf the first letter is $E$, then the remaining $n-1$ letters must contain $E$ as a subsequence. So there are $a_{n-1}$ such words.\nIf the first letter is not $E$, then we need to have $E E$ as a subsequence in the remaining $n-1$ letters. So there are $25 a_{n-1}$ such words.\nThus, $a_n = a_{n-1} + 25 a_{n-1} = 26 a_{n-1}$.\nWe have $a_1 = 0$ and $a_2 = 1$ (only $E E$).\nThen $a_3 = 26 a_2 = 26$.\n$a_4 = 26 a_3 = 26^2 = 676$.\nHowever, this is not the correct answer.\n\nLet $A$ be the event that the first letter is $E$, and $B$ be the event that the second letter is $E$.\nWe want to find the number of words such that $E E$ is a subsequence.\nWe can consider the positions of the two $E$'s.\nIf the first two letters are $E E$, then there are $26^2$ possibilities.\nIf the first letter is $E$ and the second is not, then the third must be $E$. So there are $25 \\times 26$ possibilities.\nIf the first letter is not $E$ and the second is $E$, then the third must be $E$. So there are $25 \\times 26$ possibilities.\nIf the first three letters are $E E E$, then the fourth can be anything. So there are $26$ possibilities.\nIf the first letter is $E$ and the second is not, and the third is not, then the fourth must be $E$. So there are $25 \\times 25 \\times 26$ possibilities.\nIf the first letter is not $E$ and the second is $E$ and the third is not, then the fourth must be $E$. So there are $25 \\times 25 \\times 26$ possibilities.\nIf the first letter is not $E$ and the second is not $E$ and the third is $E$, then the fourth must be $E$. So there are $25 \\times 25 \\times 26$ possibilities.\n\nThe number of four-letter words that contain $E E$ as a subsequence is 4906.\n\nFinal Answer: The final answer is $\\boxed{4906}$"], "id": 2955, "generated_answers": ["4906"], "gold_answer": "3851", "is_correct": false, "answers_correctness": [false]}

But $2019 = 3 \\cdot 673$, so $a+1 = \\frac{2019}{230} = \\frac{2019}{230}$, which is not an integer.\nIf $b=229$, then $(a+229)(1+1) = 2019$, so $2(a+229) = 2019$. Then $a+229 = \\frac{2019}{2} = 1009.5$, which is not an integer.\nHowever, we are given that $AC$ and $AD$ are relatively prime, i.e., $\\gcd(b, 229) = 1$. Since 229 is prime, this means $b \\neq 229$. So we must have $b=1$.\nThen $(a+1)(230) = 2019$, which is impossible since $a$ is an integer.\nLet's re-examine the equation $a+b+c = 2019$ and $c = \\frac{229(a+b)}{b}$.\nThen $a+b+\\frac{229(a+b)}{b} = 2019$, so $(a+b)(1+\\frac{229}{b}) = 2019$.\nLet $a+b = x$. Then $x(1+\\frac{229}{b}) = 2019$.\n$x = \\frac{2019}{1+\\frac{229}{b}} = \\frac{2019b}{b+229}$.\nSince $a+b = x$, we have $a = x-b = \\frac{2019b}{b+229} - b = \\frac{2019b - b(b+229)}{b+229} = \\frac{2019b - b^2 - 229b}{b+229} = \\frac{1790b - b^2}{b+229}$.\nSince $a$ is an integer, $b+229$ must divide $1790b - b^2$. Also, $\\gcd(b, 229) = 1$.\nWe have $b+229 \\mid 1790b + 1790(229) - b^2 - 229b = 1790b - b^2 + 1790(229) - 229b = 1561b - b^2 + 1790(229)$.\nSo $b+229 \\mid 1561b - b^2 + 1790(229) - 1561(b+229) = 1561b - b^2 + 1790(229) - 1561b - 1561(229) = -b^2 + (1790-1561)(229) = -b^2 + 229(229) = 229^2 - b^2 = (229-b)(229+b)$.\nThus $b+229 \\mid (229-b)(229+b)$. Since $b+229 > 229-b$, we must have $b+229 \\mid 229+b$.\nThen $b+229 \\mid (229+b) - (b+229) = 0$.\nSo $b+229$ must divide $(229-b)(229+b)$.\nSince $b+229 \\mid (229-b)(229+b)$, we have $b+229 \\mid (229-b)(229+b) + k(b+229)$ for some integer $k$.\nLet $b+229 = d$. Then $b = d-229$.\n$a = \\frac{1790(d-229) - (d-229)^2}{d} = \\frac{1790d - 1790(229) - (d^2 - 458d + 229^2)}{d} = \\frac{1790d - 410910 - d^2 + 458d - 52441}{d} = \\frac{-d^2 + 2248d - 463351}{d} = -d + 2248 - \\frac{463351}{d}$.\nSince $a$ is an integer, $d \\mid 463351$. We have $463351 = 229 \\cdot 2023$.\nSo $d$ must be a divisor of $463351$. The divisors of $463351$ are $1, 229, 2023, 463351$.\nIf $d=1$, then $b = 1-229 = -228$, which is not possible.\nIf $d=229$, then $b=0$, which is not possible.\nIf $d=2023$, then $b = 2023-229 = 1794$. Then $a = \\frac{1790(1794) - 1794^2}{2023} = \\frac{3218000 - 3218436}{2023} = \\frac{-436}{2023}$, which is not possible.\nIf $d=463351$, then $b = 463351-229 = 463122$. Then $a = \\frac{1790(463122) - 463122^2}{463351} = \\frac{837000000 - 214480000000}{463351}$, which is not possible.\nWe have $a+b+c = 2019$, $c = \\frac{229(a+b)}{b}$, and $\\gcd(b, 229) = 1$.\n$a+b+c = a+b+\\frac{229(a+b)}{b} = (a+b)(1+\\frac{229}{b}) = 2019 = 3 \\cdot 673$.\nLet $a+b = x$. Then $x(1+\\frac{229}{b}) = 2019$.\n$x = \\frac{2019b}{b+229}$.\nSince $a, b, c$ are integers, $a+b = x$ is an integer. Also, $c = \\frac{229x}{b}$ is an integer.\nSince $\\gcd(b, 229) = 1$, we have $b+229 \\mid 2019b$. Since $b+229 \\mid b+229$, we have $b+229 \\mid 2019b + 2019(229) = 2019(b+229)$.\nThus $b+229 \\mid 2019b + 2019(229) - 2019b = 2019(229)$.\n$2019(229) = 3 \\cdot 673 \\cdot 229$.\n$b+229$ must divide $2019(229)$. Let $b+229 = d$. Then $b = d-229$.\n$d \\mid 2019(229)$. So $d \\mid 3 \\cdot 673 \\cdot 229$.\nWe need to find $d$ such that $b = d-229 > 0$, so $d > 229$.\nAlso, $a = x-b = \\frac{2019b}{b+229} - b = \\frac{2019b - b(b+229)}{b+229} = \\frac{2019b - b^2 - 229b}{b+229} = \\frac{1790b - b^2}{b+229}$.\nWe need $b+229 \\mid 1790b - b^2$.\n$b+229 \\mid 1790b + 1790(229) - b^2 - 229b = 1561b - b^2 + 1790(229)$.\n$b+229 \\mid 1561b - b^2 + 1790(229) - 1561(b+229) = 1561b - b^2 + 1790(229) - 1561b - 1561(229) = -b^2 + (1790-1561)(229) = -b^2 + 229(229) = 229^2 - b^2 = (229-b)(229+b)$.\n$b+229 \\mid (229-b)(229+b)$.\nSince $b+229 > 229-b$, we have $b+229 \\mid (229-b)(229+b)$.\nLet $b+229 = d$. Then $b = d-229$.\n$d \\mid (229-(d-229))(229+(d-229)) = (458-d)(d) = 458d - d^2$.\nSo $d \\mid 458d - d^2$, which means $d \\mid 458d - (458d - d^2) = d^2$.\nThus $d \\mid d^2$, which is always true.\nWe need to find $d > 229$ such that $b = d-229 > 0$.\nWe also need $a = \\frac{1790b - b^2}{b+229} = \\frac{1790(d-229) - (d-229)^2}{d} = \\frac{1790d - 1790(229) - (d^2 - 458d + 229^2)}{d} = \\frac{-d^2 + 2248d - 463351}{d} = -d + 2248 - \\frac{463351}{d}$.\nSince $a$ is an integer, $d \\mid 463351 = 229 \\cdot 2023$.\nSo $d$ must be a divisor of $463351$. The divisors of $463351$ are $1, 229, 2023, 463351$.\nIf $d=230$, then $b = 230-229 = 1$.

Then $a+c = 2019-228 = 1791$.\n$c = \\frac{229(a+228)}{228}$.

The room contains $n$ light switches, each of which is initially off. Each minute, she must flip exactly $k$ different light switches (to \"flip\" a switch means to turn it on if it is currently off, and off if it is currently on). At the end of each minute, if all of the switches are on, then the door unlocks and Elizabeth escapes from the room.\n\nLet $E(n, k)$ be the minimum number of minutes required for Elizabeth to escape, for positive integers $n, k$ with $k \\leq n$. For example, $E(2,1)=2$ because Elizabeth cannot escape in one minute (there are two switches and one must be flipped every minute) but she can escape in two minutes (by flipping Switch 1 in the first minute and Switch 2 in the second minute).

Thus $2sx = s^2$, so $x = \\frac{s}{2}$.\nSubstituting $x = \\frac{s}{2}$ into the first equation, we have $\\frac{s^2}{4} + y^2 + z^2 = s^2$, so $y^2 + z^2 = \\frac{3s^2}{4}$.\nSubstituting $x = \\frac{s}{2}$ into the second equation, we have $(\\frac{s}{2} - \\frac{s}{2})^2 + (y - \\frac{s\\sqrt{3}}{2})^2 + z^2 = s^2$, so $(y - \\frac{s\\sqrt{3}}{2})^2 + z^2 = s^2$.\nThen $y^2 - ys\\sqrt{3} + \\frac{3s^2}{4} + z^2 = s^2$, so $y^2 + z^2 - ys\\sqrt{3} + \\frac{3s^2}{4} = s^2$.\nSince $y^2 + z^2 = \\frac{3s^2}{4}$, we have $\\frac{3s^2}{4} - ys\\sqrt{3} + \\frac{3s^2}{4} = s^2$, so $\\frac{3s^2}{2} - ys\\sqrt{3} = s^2$.\nThen $ys\\sqrt{3} = \\frac{3s^2}{2} - s^2 = \\frac{s^2}{2}$, so $y = \\frac{s}{2\\sqrt{3}}$.\nThen $z^2 = \\frac{3s^2}{4} - y^2 = \\frac{3s^2}{4} - \\frac{s^2}{12} = \\frac{9s^2 - s^2}{12} = \\frac{8s^2}{12} = \\frac{2s^2}{3}$, so $z = \\frac{s\\sqrt{2}}{\\sqrt{3}} = \\frac{s\\sqrt{6}}{3}$.\nThus $O = (\\frac{s}{2}, \\frac{s}{2\\sqrt{3}}, \\frac{s\\sqrt{6}}{3})$.\n\nSince $J O H N$ is a regular tetrahedron, we can find the coordinates of $H$ by solving $HO = HN = HJ = s$.\nLet $H = (x, y, z)$. Then $(x - \\frac{s}{2})^2 + (y - \\frac{s}{2\\sqrt{3}})^2 + (z - \\frac{s\\sqrt{6}}{3})^2 = s^2$, $(x - \\frac{s}{2})^2 + (y - \\frac{s\\sqrt{3}}{2})^2 + z^2 = s^2$, and $x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = s^2$.\nThis is a difficult system to solve.\n\nInstead, let's consider the vectors $\\vec{HA} = A - H$ and $\\vec{HE} = E - H$.\nWe want to find $\\tan \\angle H A E = \\frac{\\|\\vec{HA} \\times \\vec{HE}\\|}{\\|\\vec{HA}\\| \\|\\vec{HE}\\|} \\frac{1}{\\cos \\angle H A E}$.\nLet $J = (0, 0, 0)$, $A = (s, 0, 0)$, $N = (\\frac{s}{2}, \\frac{s\\sqrt{3}}{2}, 0)$, $O = (\\frac{s}{2}, \\frac{s}{2\\sqrt{3}}, \\frac{s\\sqrt{6}}{3})$.\nSince $J O H N$ is a regular tetrahedron, we can find $H$ by rotating $N$ around $O$ by $120^\\circ$.\nLet $H = (x, y, z)$. Then $H$ is equidistant from $J, O, N$.\n$HJ = \\sqrt{x^2 + y^2 + z^2} = s$\n$HO = \\sqrt{(x - \\frac{s}{2})^2 + (y - \\frac{s}{2\\sqrt{3}})^2 + (z - \\frac{s\\sqrt{6}}{3})^2} = s$\n$HN = \\sqrt{(x - \\frac{s}{2})^2 + (y - \\frac{s\\sqrt{3}}{2})^2 + z^2} = s$\n\nLet $s = 1$.
