{"question": "If $f(x)$ is a polynomial of degree 7, and $g(x)$ is a polynomial of degree 7, then what is the product of the minimum and the maximum possible degrees of $f(x) + g(x)$?", "generated_responses": ["Let $f(x)$ be a polynomial of degree 7 and $g(x)$ be a polynomial of degree 7.\nLet $f(x) = a_7x^7 + a_6x^6 + \\dots + a_1x + a_0$, where $a_7 \\neq 0$.\nLet $g(x) = b_7x^7 + b_6x^6 + \\dots + b_1x + b_0$, where $b_7 \\neq 0$.\nThen $f(x) + g(x) = (a_7 + b_7)x^7 + (a_6 + b_6)x^6 + \\dots + (a_1 + b_1)x + (a_0 + b_0)$.\nThe degree of $f(x) + g(x)$ is the highest power of $x$ with a non-zero coefficient.\n\nThe maximum possible degree of $f(x) + g(x)$ occurs when $a_7 + b_7 \\neq 0$. In this case, the degree of $f(x) + g(x)$ is 7.\nThe minimum possible degree of $f(x) + g(x)$ occurs when $a_7 + b_7 = 0$, $a_6 + b_6 = 0$, ..., $a_1 + b_1 = 0$, $a_0 + b_0 \\neq 0$.\nIn this case, $f(x) + g(x) = a_0 + b_0$, which is a constant polynomial, so the degree is 0.\nHowever, if $a_7 + b_7 = 0$, $a_6 + b_6 = 0$, ..., $a_1 + b_1 = 0$, and $a_0 + b_0 = 0$, then $f(x) + g(x) = 0$, which has no degree.\n\nIf $a_7 + b_7 = 0$, then $b_7 = -a_7$.\nWe can choose $b_6, \\dots, b_0$ such that $a_i + b_i = 0$ for $i = 0, 1, \\dots, 6$. Then $b_i = -a_i$ for $i = 0, 1, \\dots, 6$.\nThen $f(x) + g(x) = (a_7 + b_7)x^7 + (a_6 + b_6)x^6 + \\dots + (a_0 + b_0) = (a_7 - a_7)x^7 + (a_6 - a_6)x^6 + \\dots + (a_0 - a_0) = 0$.\nThe polynomial $f(x) + g(x) = 0$ has no degree.\nHowever, we can consider the case where $f(x) + g(x)$ is the zero polynomial. Then the degree is undefined.\nIf $f(x) + g(x)$ is a non-zero polynomial, the minimum degree is 0.\n\nIf $a_7 + b_7 \\neq 0$, then the degree of $f(x) + g(x)$ is 7.\nIf $a_7 + b_7 = 0$, then the degree of $f(x) + g(x)$ can be at most 6.\nIf $a_7 + b_7 = 0$ and $a_6 + b_6 \\neq 0$, then the degree of $f(x) + g(x)$ is 6.\nIf $a_7 + b_7 = 0$ and $a_6 + b_6 = 0$, then the degree of $f(x) + g(x)$ can be at most 5.\nContinuing this process, the minimum degree of $f(x) + g(x)$ is 0, which occurs when $a_i + b_i = 0$ for all $i = 0, 1, \\dots, 7$.\nThe maximum degree of $f(x) + g(x)$ is 7, which occurs when $a_7 + b_7 \\neq 0$.\n\nThe minimum possible degree of $f(x) + g(x)$ is 0, and the maximum possible degree of $f(x) + g(x)$ is 7.\nThe product of the minimum and maximum possible degrees is $0 \\cdot 7 = 0$.\n\nFinal Answer: The final answer is $\\boxed{0}$"], "id": "1", "generated_answers": ["0"], "gold_answer": "0", "is_correct": true, "answers_correctness": [true]}
