For example, the number 5 in binary is \\(101_2\\), so its weight is 2.\n\n### Step 2: Counting Numbers with Even and Odd Weights\nWe need to count the number of integers from 1 to \\(2^{2017}\\) that have even weight and the number that have odd weight.\n\n### Step 3: Symmetry in Binary Representation\nConsider the binary representation of numbers from 0 to \\(2^{2017} - 1\\). Each number in this range can be represented as a 2017-bit binary string (since \\(2^{2017}\\) is a 2018-bit number, but we are considering numbers up to \\(2^{2017} - 1\\)).\n\n### Step 4: Parity of the Weight\nThe weight of a number is even if the number of 1s in its binary representation is even, and it is odd if the number of 1s is odd.\n\n### Step 5: Using Combinatorial Argument\nFor a 2017-bit binary string, the number of strings with an even number of 1s is equal to the number of strings with an odd number of 1s. This is because each bit can independently be either 0 or 1, and the parity of the number of 1s is equally likely to be even or odd.\n\n### Step 6: Counting the Total Number of 2017-bit Binary Strings\nThe total number of 2017-bit binary strings is \\(2^{2017}\\).\n\n### Step 7: Counting the Number of Even and Odd Weighted Numbers\nSince the number of 2017-bit binary strings with even weight is equal to the number of 2017-bit binary strings with odd weight, we have:\n\\[\n\\text{Number of even-weighted numbers} = \\text{Number of odd-weighted numbers} = \\frac{2^{2017}}{2} = 2^{2016}\n\\]\n\n### Step 8: Considering the Range from 1 to \\(2^{2017}\\)\nThe range from 1 to \\(2^{2017}\\) includes \\(2^{2017} - 1\\) numbers.

We can use the fact that the sum of any three consecutive terms is at most 1 to derive some properties of the sequence.\n\n### Step 4: Using Symmetry and periodicity\nGiven the periodic nature of the constraints (i.e., \\( x_{101} = x_1 \\) and \\( x_{102} = x_2 \\)), we can assume a symmetric or periodic pattern in the sequence to simplify the problem.\n\n### Step 5: Constructing a Candidate Sequence\nLet's consider a candidate sequence where \\( x_i = \\frac{1}{2} \\) for all \\( i \\).

The constraints \\( x_i + x_{i+1} + x_{i+2} \\leq 1 \\) imply that the product \\( x_i x_{i+2} \\) is maximized when \\( x_i \\) and \\( x_{i+2} \\) are as large as possible while still satisfying the constraints.

In other words, no two kings can be placed in adjacent squares (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally).\n2. **Each Row and Column Contains Exactly 25 Kings**: This constraint ensures that the placement is balanced across the board.\n\n### Step 2: Placing Kings in a Row\nConsider a single row of the chessboard.

Let's test some values of \\( n \\geq 3 \\):\n\n#### Case \\( n = 3 \\)\n\\[\n\\Delta = (2^4 - 1)^2 - 8 \\cdot 3^3\n\\]\n\\[\n\\Delta = (16 - 1)^2 - 8 \\cdot 27\n\\]\n\\[\n\\Delta = 15^2 - 216\n\\]\n\\[\n\\Delta = 225 - 216 = 9\n\\]\n\\[\n\\sqrt{9} = 3\n\\]\nSince \\(\\Delta\\) is a perfect square, we solve for \\( m \\):\n\\[\nm = \\frac{2^{n+1} - 1 \\pm \\sqrt{\\Delta}}{2}\n\\]\n\\[\nm = \\frac{15 \\pm 3}{2}\n\\]\n\\[\nm = 9 \\quad \\text{or} \\quad m = 6\n\\]\n\nWe need to check if these values satisfy the original equation:\n- For \\( m = 9 \\):\n\\[\n9^2 + 2 \\cdot 3^3 = 9(2^4 - 1)\n\\]\n\\[\n81 + 54 = 9 \\cdot 15\n\\]\n\\[\n135 = 135\n\\]\nThis is true.\n\n- For \\( m = 6 \\):\n\\[\n6^2 + 2 \\cdot 3^3 = 6(2^4 - 1)\n\\]\n\\[\n36 + 54 = 6 \\cdot 15\n\\]\n\\[\n90 = 90\n\\]\nThis is true.\n\nThus, the solutions for \\( n = 3 \\) are \\( (m, n) = (9, 3) \\) and \\( (m, n) = (6, 3) \\).\n\n### Step 3: Verify no other solutions for \\( n \\geq 4 \\)\n\nFor \\( n \\geq 4 \\), the discriminant \\(\\Delta\\) becomes increasingly large and it is unlikely to be a perfect square. We can verify this by checking the growth rates of the terms involved. The term \\( 2^{n+1} - 1 \\) grows exponentially, while \\( 8 \\cdot 3^n \\) also grows exponentially but at a different rate. The difference between these terms makes it highly unlikely for \\(\\Delta\\) to be a perfect square for \\( n \\geq 4 \\).\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe only solutions are:\n\\[\n\\boxed{(0, 1), (9, 3), (6, 3)}\n\\]"], "id": 1737, "generated_answers": ["(0, 1), (9, 3), (6, 3)"], "gold_answer": "$(6,3),(9,3),(9,5),(54,5)$", "is_correct": false, "answers_correctness": [false]}

The key observation is that the sum of squares of polynomials is always non-negative for all real \\( x \\). Therefore, each \\( f_i(x) \\) must be a polynomial with rational coefficients.\n\n### Step 2: Degree Analysis\nConsider the degrees of the polynomials \\( f_i(x) \\). If \\( f_i(x) \\) is a polynomial of degree \\( d_i \\), then \\( f_i(x)^2 \\) is a polynomial of degree \\( 2d_i \\). The highest degree term in \\( x^2 + 7 \\) is \\( x^2 \\), which is of degree 2. Therefore, the highest degree term in the sum \\( f_1(x)^2 + f_2(x)^2 + \\cdots + f_n(x)^2 \\) must also be of degree 2.\n\n### Step 3: Possible Degrees of \\( f_i(x) \\)\nSince the highest degree term in \\( x^2 + 7 \\) is \\( x^2 \\), the highest degree term in \\( f_i(x)^2 \\) must be \\( x^2 \\). This implies that the highest degree of \\( f_i(x) \\) must be 1. Therefore, each \\( f_i(x) \\) must be a linear polynomial of the form \\( f_i(x) = a_i x + b_i \\) where \\( a_i \\) and \\( b_i \\) are rational numbers.\n\n### Step 4: Form of \\( f_i(x) \\)\nLet \\( f_i(x) = a_i x + b_i \\). Then,\n\n\\[\nf_i(x)^2 = (a_i x + b_i)^2 = a_i^2 x^2 + 2a_i b_i x + b_i^2.\n\\]\n\n### Step 5: Sum of Squares\nWe need to find \\( n \\) such that\n\n\\[\nx^2 + 7 = \\sum_{i=1}^n (a_i^2 x^2 + 2a_i b_i x + b_i^2).\n\\]\n\n### Step 6: Coefficient Comparison\nBy comparing coefficients, we get the following system of equations:\n1. The coefficient of \\( x^2 \\) on the left is 1, and on the right is \\( \\sum_{i=1}^n a_i^2 \\). Therefore,\n   \\[\n   \\sum_{i=1}^n a_i^2 = 1.\n   \\]\n2. The coefficient of \\( x \\) on the left is 0, and on the right is \\( \\sum_{i=1}^n 2a_i b_i \\). Therefore,\n   \\[\n   \\sum_{i=1}^n 2a_i b_i = 0.\n   \\]\n3. The constant term on the left is 7, and on the right is \\( \\sum_{i=1}^n b_i^2 \\). Therefore,\n   \\[\n   \\sum_{i=1}^n b_i^2 = 7.\n   \\]\n\n### Step 7: Solving the System\nWe need to find the smallest \\( n \\) such that these equations can be satisfied with rational \\( a_i \\) and \\( b_i \\).\n\n- For \\( n = 1 \\), we have \\( a_1^2 = 1 \\) and \\( b_1^2 = 7 \\).

For each pair, the term \\((s - r - n)\\) is multiplied by the product \\(x_r x_s\\).\n\n### Step 2: Simplifying the Problem\nTo maximize the sum, we need to consider the values of \\(x_i\\) that will maximize each term \\((s - r - n) x_r x_s\\).

We need to consider the sign of \\((s - r - n)\\) to determine how to choose \\(x_r\\) and \\(x_s\\):\n- If \\(s - r > n\\), then \\((s - r - n) > 0\\), and we should choose \\(x_r = x_s = 1\\) to maximize the term.\n- If \\(s - r < n\\), then \\((s - r - n) < 0\\), and we should choose \\(x_r = x_s = -1\\) to maximize the term.\n- If \\(s - r = n\\), then \\((s - r - n) = 0\\), and the term is zero regardless of the values of \\(x_r\\) and \\(x_s\\).\n\n### Step 4: Constructing the Optimal Solution\nTo maximize the sum, we should set \\(x_i = 1\\) for \\(i = 1, 2, \\ldots, n\\) and \\(x_i = -1\\) for \\(i = n+1, n+2, \\ldots, 2n\\).

A partition is good if the least common multiple (LCM) of the elements in \\( A_1 \\) is equal to the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the elements in \\( A_2 \\).\n\n### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Understanding the Problem:**\n   - We need to find the smallest \\( n \\) such that there exists a set \\( A \\) of \\( n \\) positive integers with exactly 2015 good partitions.\n   - A good partition requires that the LCM of the elements in \\( A_1 \\) equals the GCD of the elements in \\( A_2 \\).\n\n2. **Properties of LCM and GCD:**\n   - The LCM of a set of numbers is the smallest number that is a multiple of all the numbers in the set.\n   - The GCD of a set of numbers is the largest number that divides all the numbers in the set.\n\n3. **Constructing a Set with Good Partitions:**\n   - Consider a set \\( A \\) consisting of powers of a single prime number \\( p \\). For example, \\( A = \\{ p, p^2, p^3, \\ldots, p^k \\} \\).\n   - For any partition of \\( A \\) into \\( A_1 \\) and \\( A_2 \\), the LCM of the elements in \\( A_1 \\) will be \\( p^{\\max(a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_m)} \\) where \\( a_i \\) are the exponents of \\( p \\) in \\( A_1 \\).\n   - The GCD of the elements in \\( A_2 \\) will be \\( p^{\\min(b_1, b_2, \\ldots, b_n)} \\) where \\( b_i \\) are the exponents of \\( p \\) in \\( A_2 \\).\n\n4. **Counting Good Partitions:**\n   - For the partition to be good, we need \\( p^{\\max(a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_m)} = p^{\\min(b_1, b_2, \\ldots, b_n)} \\).\n   - This implies that the maximum exponent in \\( A_1 \\) must equal the minimum exponent in \\( A_2 \\).\n\n5. **Finding the Minimum \\( n \\):**\n   - Let \\( A = \\{ p, p^2, p^3, \\ldots, p^k \\} \\).\n   - The number of good partitions is determined by the number of ways to choose \\( A_1 \\) and \\( A_2 \\) such that the maximum exponent in \\( A_1 \\) equals the minimum exponent in \\( A_2 \\).\n   - For a set of \\( k \\) elements, the number of good partitions is \\( 2^{k-1} \\) (since each element can either be in \\( A_1 \\) or \\( A_2 \\), except for the element with the maximum exponent which must be in \\( A_1 \\) and the element with the minimum exponent which must be in \\( A_2 \\)).\n\n6. **Solving for \\( k \\):**\n   - We need \\( 2^{k-1} = 2015 \\).\n   - Solving \\( 2^{k-1} = 2015 \\), we find that \\( k-1 = 11 \\) (since \\( 2^{11} = 2048 \\) and \\( 2^{10} = 1024 \\)).\n   - Therefore, \\( k = 12 \\).\n\nThus, the minimum value of \\( n \\) such that there exists a set of \\( n \\) positive integers with exactly 2015 good partitions is \\(\\boxed{12}\\)."], "id": 1945, "generated_answers": ["12"], "gold_answer": "3024", "is_correct": false, "answers_correctness": [false]}

This minimum value is denoted as \\(D\\).\n\n### Step 2: Understanding George's Strategy\nGeorge's strategy is to choose the numbers one by one in such a way that the absolute value of the partial sum is minimized at each step. This means that at each step, George chooses the number that minimizes the absolute value of the current partial sum.\n\n### Step 3: Analyzing the Relationship Between \\(D\\) and \\(G\\)\nWe need to find the least possible constant \\(c\\) such that \\(G \\leq cD\\) for all possible sequences of \\(n\\) real numbers.\n\n#### Key Insight:\nConsider the sequence of partial sums \\(S_i = x_1 + x_2 + \\cdots + x_i\\).

The worst-case scenario for George is when the sequence of partial sums \\(S_i\\) is as close to zero as possible at each step, but still, the maximum absolute value of \\(S_i\\) is \\(D\\).\n\n#### Example:\nConsider the sequence \\(\\{1, -1, 1, -1, \\ldots\\}\\). If \\(n\\) is even, the partial sums will be \\(1, 0, 1, 0, \\ldots, 0\\). The maximum absolute value of the partial sums is 1, so \\(D = 1\\). George's strategy will also result in the partial sums being \\(1, 0, 1, 0, \\ldots, 0\\), so \\(G = 1\\).\n\nIf \\(n\\) is odd, the partial sums will be \\(1, 0, 1, 0, \\ldots, 1\\). The maximum absolute value of the partial sums is 1, so \\(D = 1\\). George's strategy will result in the partial sums being \\(1, 0, 1, 0, \\ldots, 1\\), so \\(G = 1\\).\n\nIn both cases, \\(G = D\\).\n\n### Step 5: General Case\nFor any sequence of \\(n\\) real numbers, the maximum absolute value of the partial sums \\(D\\) is the minimum possible maximum absolute value of the partial sums. George's strategy will always result in a sequence of partial sums that is as close to zero as possible at each step, but the maximum absolute value of the partial sums will still be at most \\(D\\).\n\nThus, \\(G \\leq D\\).\n\n### Step 6: Conclusion\nThe least possible constant \\(c\\) such that \\(G \\leq cD\\) for all possible sequences of \\(n\\) real numbers is \\(c = 2\\).\n\nTherefore, the answer is \\(\\boxed{2}\\)."], "id": 1968, "generated_answers": ["2"], "gold_answer": "2", "is_correct": true, "answers_correctness": [true]}

For an equilateral triangle inscribed in a circle of radius 1, the side length \\( s \\) can be calculated using the formula for the side length of an equilateral triangle inscribed in a circle:\n\\[ s = \\sqrt{3} \\]\nThus, the perimeter of this equilateral triangle is:\n\\[ P_{\\text{max}} = 3s = 3\\sqrt{3} \\]\n\n### Step 4: Condition for the Perimeter\nWe need to find all positive real numbers \\( t \\) such that for each positive integer \\( n \\), there exists a good collection of \\( n \\) triangles, each with a perimeter greater than \\( t \\).\n\n### Step 5: Analyzing the Perimeter Constraint\nSince the maximum perimeter of any inscribed triangle is \\( 3\\sqrt{3} \\), for any \\( t \\) greater than \\( 3\\sqrt{3} \\), it is impossible to find a triangle with a perimeter greater than \\( t \\).

The diagonals of a square are equal in length and bisect each other at right angles. The slopes of the diagonals of a square are negative reciprocals of each other.\n\n### Step 2: Determine the Slope of the Diagonals\nGiven that the slope of diagonal \\( WY \\) is 2, the slope of the other diagonal \\( XZ \\) must be the negative reciprocal of 2. Therefore, the slope of \\( XZ \\) is:\n\\[\n-\\frac{1}{2}\n\\]\n\n### Step 3: Relate the Slopes of the Diagonals to the Sides\nThe diagonals of a square bisect each other at right angles. This means that the slopes of the sides of the square are related to the slopes of the diagonals. Specifically, the slopes of the sides of the square are the averages of the slopes of the diagonals.\n\n### Step 4: Calculate the Slopes of the Sides\nLet the slope of \\( WX \\) be \\( m_1 \\) and the slope of \\( XY \\) be \\( m_2 \\). Since \\( WX \\) and \\( XY \\) are perpendicular, their slopes are negative reciprocals of each other. We can use the fact that the average of the slopes of the diagonals gives us the slopes of the sides.\n\nThe average slope of the diagonals \\( WY \\) and \\( XZ \\) is:\n\\[\n\\frac{2 + \\left(-\\frac{1}{2}\\right)}{2} = \\frac{2 - \\frac{1}{2}}{2} = \\frac{\\frac{3}{2}}{2} = \\frac{3}{4}\n\\]\n\nHowever, this average slope is not directly the slope of the sides. Instead, we use the fact that the slopes of the sides are the negative reciprocals of each other.

Formally, a group assignment on $T$ is a function $f: T \\rightarrow\\{1,2, \\ldots, k\\}$, satisfying the condition that if $f\\left(r_{i}\\right)=f\\left(r_{j}\\right)$ for $i \\neq j$, then $r_{i}$ and $r_{j}$ do not know any of the same recipes.

If $\\operatorname{gr}(T)>\\left|\\operatorname{chef}_{T}(D)\\right|$ for each dish $D \\in \\operatorname{dish}(T)$, then $T$ is called heterogeneous. For example, ARMLton is homogeneous, because $\\operatorname{gr}($ ARMLton $)=2$ and exactly two chefs make pie, but ARMLville is heterogeneous, because even though each dish is only cooked by two chefs, $\\operatorname{gr}($ ARMLville $)=3$.\n\n\nA resident cycle is a sequence of distinct residents $r_{1}, \\ldots, r_{n}$ such that for each $1 \\leq i \\leq n-1$, the residents $r_{i}$ and $r_{i+1}$ know how to make a common dish, residents $r_{n}$ and $r_{1}$ know how to make a common dish, and no other pair of residents $r_{i}$ and $r_{j}, 1 \\leq i, j \\leq n$ know how to make a common dish. Two resident cycles are indistinguishable if they contain the same residents (in any order), and distinguishable otherwise. For example, if $r_{1}, r_{2}, r_{3}, r_{4}$ is a resident cycle, then $r_{2}, r_{1}, r_{4}, r_{3}$ and $r_{3}, r_{2}, r_{1}, r_{4}$ are indistinguishable resident cycles.\nCompute the number of distinguishable resident cycles of length 6 in $\\mathcal{F}_{8}$.", "generated_responses": ["To solve the problem, we need to determine the number of distinguishable resident cycles of length 6 in a full town \\(\\mathcal{F}_8\\) where the residents collectively know how to make 8 dishes.

{"question": "In each town in ARMLandia, the residents have formed groups, which meet each week to share math problems and enjoy each others' company over a potluck-style dinner. Each town resident belongs to exactly one group. Every week, each resident is required to make one dish and to bring it to his/her group.\n\nIt so happens that each resident knows how to make precisely two dishes. Moreover, no two residents of a town know how to make the same pair of dishes. Shown below are two example towns. In the left column are the names of the town's residents. Adjacent to each name is the list of dishes that the corresponding resident knows how to make.\n\n| ARMLton |  |\n| :--- | :--- |\n| Resident | Dishes |\n| Paul | pie, turkey |\n| Arnold | pie, salad |\n| Kelly | salad, broth |\n\n\n| ARMLville |  |\n| :--- | :--- |\n| Resident | Dishes |\n| Sally | steak, calzones |\n| Ross | calzones, pancakes |\n| David | steak, pancakes |\n\nThe population of a town $T$, denoted $\\operatorname{pop}(T)$, is the number of residents of $T$. Formally, the town itself is simply the set of its residents, denoted by $\\left\\{r_{1}, \\ldots, r_{\\mathrm{pop}(T)}\\right\\}$ unless otherwise specified. The set of dishes that the residents of $T$ collectively know how to make is denoted $\\operatorname{dish}(T)$. For example, in the town of ARMLton described above, pop(ARMLton) $=3$, and dish(ARMLton) $=$ \\{pie, turkey, salad, broth\\}.\n\nA town $T$ is called full if for every pair of dishes in $\\operatorname{dish}(T)$, there is exactly one resident in $T$ who knows how to make those two dishes. In the examples above, ARMLville is a full town, but ARMLton is not, because (for example) nobody in ARMLton knows how to make both turkey and salad.\n\nDenote by $\\mathcal{F}_{d}$ a full town in which collectively the residents know how to make $d$ dishes. That is, $\\left|\\operatorname{dish}\\left(\\mathcal{F}_{d}\\right)\\right|=d$.\n\nIn order to avoid the embarrassing situation where two people bring the same dish to a group dinner, if two people know how to make a common dish, they are forbidden from participating in the same group meeting. Formally, a group assignment on $T$ is a function $f: T \\rightarrow\\{1,2, \\ldots, k\\}$, satisfying the condition that if $f\\left(r_{i}\\right)=f\\left(r_{j}\\right)$ for $i \\neq j$, then $r_{i}$ and $r_{j}$ do not know any of the same recipes. The group number of a town $T$, denoted $\\operatorname{gr}(T)$, is the least positive integer $k$ for which there exists a group assignment on $T$.\n\nFor example, consider once again the town of ARMLton. A valid group assignment would be $f($ Paul $)=f($ Kelly $)=1$ and $f($ Arnold $)=2$. The function which gives the value 1 to each resident of ARMLton is not a group assignment, because Paul and Arnold must be assigned to different groups.\n\n\nFor a dish $D$, a resident is called a $D$-chef if he or she knows how to make the dish $D$. Define $\\operatorname{chef}_{T}(D)$ to be the set of residents in $T$ who are $D$-chefs. For example, in ARMLville, David is a steak-chef and a pancakes-chef. Further, $\\operatorname{chef}_{\\text {ARMLville }}($ steak $)=\\{$ Sally, David $\\}$.\n\n\nIf $\\operatorname{gr}(T)=\\left|\\operatorname{chef}_{T}(D)\\right|$ for some $D \\in \\operatorname{dish}(T)$, then $T$ is called homogeneous. If $\\operatorname{gr}(T)>\\left|\\operatorname{chef}_{T}(D)\\right|$ for each dish $D \\in \\operatorname{dish}(T)$, then $T$ is called heterogeneous. For example, ARMLton is homogeneous, because $\\operatorname{gr}($ ARMLton $)=2$ and exactly two chefs make pie, but ARMLville is heterogeneous, because even though each dish is only cooked by two chefs, $\\operatorname{gr}($ ARMLville $)=3$.\n\n\nA resident cycle is a sequence of distinct residents $r_{1}, \\ldots, r_{n}$ such that for each $1 \\leq i \\leq n-1$, the residents $r_{i}$ and $r_{i+1}$ know how to make a common dish, residents $r_{n}$ and $r_{1}$ know how to make a common dish, and no other pair of residents $r_{i}$ and $r_{j}, 1 \\leq i, j \\leq n$ know how to make a common dish. Two resident cycles are indistinguishable if they contain the same residents (in any order), and distinguishable otherwise. For example, if $r_{1}, r_{2}, r_{3}, r_{4}$ is a resident cycle, then $r_{2}, r_{1}, r_{4}, r_{3}$ and $r_{3}, r_{2}, r_{1}, r_{4}$ are indistinguishable resident cycles.\nIn terms of $k$ and $d$, find the number of distinguishable resident cycles of length $k$ in $\\mathcal{F}_{d}$.", "generated_responses": ["To solve the problem, we need to determine the number of distinguishable resident cycles of length \\( k \\) in a full town \\(\\mathcal{F}_d\\).

{"question": "In ARMLopolis, every house number is a positive integer, and City Hall's address is 0. However, due to the curved nature of the cowpaths that eventually became the streets of ARMLopolis, the distance $d(n)$ between house $n$ and City Hall is not simply the value of $n$. Instead, if $n=3^{k} n^{\\prime}$, where $k \\geq 0$ is an integer and $n^{\\prime}$ is an integer not divisible by 3 , then $d(n)=3^{-k}$. For example, $d(18)=1 / 9$ and $d(17)=1$. Notice that even though no houses have negative numbers, $d(n)$ is well-defined for negative values of $n$. For example, $d(-33)=1 / 3$ because $-33=3^{1} \\cdot-11$. By definition, $d(0)=0$. Following the dictum \"location, location, location,\" this Power Question will refer to \"houses\" and \"house numbers\" interchangeably.\n\nCuriously, the arrangement of the houses is such that the distance from house $n$ to house $m$, written $d(m, n)$, is simply $d(m-n)$. For example, $d(3,4)=d(-1)=1$ because $-1=3^{0} \\cdot-1$. In particular, if $m=n$, then $d(m, n)=0$.\n\n\nThe neighborhood of a house $n$, written $\\mathcal{N}(n)$, is the set of all houses that are the same distance from City Hall as $n$. In symbols, $\\mathcal{N}(n)=\\{m \\mid d(m)=d(n)\\}$. Geometrically, it may be helpful to think of $\\mathcal{N}(n)$ as a circle centered at City Hall with radius $d(n)$.\n\nLater, ARMLopolis finally decides on a drastic expansion plan: now house numbers will be rational numbers. To define $d(p / q)$, with $p$ and $q$ integers such that $p q \\neq 0$, write $p / q=3^{k} p^{\\prime} / q^{\\prime}$, where neither $p^{\\prime}$ nor $q^{\\prime}$ is divisible by 3 and $k$ is an integer (not necessarily positive); then $d(p / q)=3^{-k}$.\nCompute $d(3 / 5), d(5 / 8)$, and $d(7 / 18)$.", "generated_responses": ["To solve for \\( d(3/5) \\), \\( d(5/8) \\), and \\( d(7/18) \\), we need to follow the given definition of the distance function \\( d \\) for rational numbers.

Finally, we need to compute \\( y \\).\n\n### Step 1: Prime Factorization of 1584\nFirst, we find the prime factorization of 1584:\n\\[\n1584 \\div 2 = 792 \\\\\n792 \\div 2 = 396 \\\\\n396 \\div 2 = 198 \\\\\n198 \\div 2 = 99 \\\\\n99 \\div 3 = 33 \\\\\n33 \\div 3 = 11 \\\\\n11 \\div 11 = 1\n\\]\nThus, the prime factorization of 1584 is:\n\\[\n1584 = 2^4 \\cdot 3^2 \\cdot 11\n\\]\n\n### Step 2: Finding \\( x \\) such that \\( 1584 \\cdot x \\) is a perfect cube\nFor \\( 1584 \\cdot x \\) to be a perfect cube, each prime factor in the product must have an exponent that is a multiple of 3. We analyze the exponents in the factorization of 1584:\n- The exponent of 2 is 4.\n- The exponent of 3 is 2.\n- The exponent of 11 is 1.\n\nTo make each exponent a multiple of 3:\n- We need to multiply by \\( 2^2 \\) to make the exponent of 2 equal to 6.\n- We need to multiply by \\( 3^1 \\) to make the exponent of 3 equal to 3.\n- We need to multiply by \\( 11^2 \\) to make the exponent of 11 equal to 3.\n\nThus, the smallest \\( x \\) is:\n\\[\nx = 2^2 \\cdot 3^1 \\cdot 11^2 = 4 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 121 = 1452\n\\]\n\n### Step 3: Finding \\( y \\) such that \\( x \\cdot y \\) is a multiple of 1584\nWe have \\( x = 1452 \\). We need to find the smallest \\( y \\) such that \\( 1452 \\cdot y \\) is a multiple of 1584. We start by finding the prime factorization of 1452:\n\\[\n1452 \\div 2 = 726 \\\\\n726 \\div 2 = 363 \\\\\n363 \\div 3 = 121 \\\\\n121 \\div 11 = 11 \\\\\n11 \\div 11 = 1\n\\]\nThus, the prime factorization of 1452 is:\n\\[\n1452 = 2^2 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 11^2\n\\]\n\nTo make \\( 1452 \\cdot y \\) a multiple of 1584, we need to ensure that the exponents of the prime factors in \\( 1452 \\cdot y \\) are at least as large as those in 1584:\n- The exponent of 2 in 1584 is 4, and in 1452 it is 2, so we need \\( y \\) to have at least \\( 2^2 \\).\n- The exponent of 3 in 1584 is 2, and in 1452 it is 1, so we need \\( y \\) to have at least \\( 3^1 \\).\n- The exponent of 11 in 1584 is 1, and in 1452 it is 2, so we need \\( y \\) to have at least \\( 11^0 \\).\n\nThus, the smallest \\( y \\) is:\n\\[\ny = 2^2 \\cdot 3^1 = 4 \\cdot 3 = 12\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{12}\n\\]"], "id": 2708, "generated_answers": ["12"], "gold_answer": "12", "is_correct": true, "answers_correctness": [true]}

Compute the least possible sum of the integers in the original list.", "generated_responses": ["To solve the problem, we need to find a list of positive integers where the mean, median, and unique mode are three consecutive integers in some order, and we need to minimize the sum of these integers.\n\nLet's denote the three consecutive integers as \\( n-1 \\), \\( n \\), and \\( n+1 \\). We need to determine the positions of these integers in the list and ensure that the mean, median, and mode are these values.\n\n### Step 1: Define the List\nLet's assume the list has \\( k \\) elements. The mode is the number that appears most frequently, and it must be one of \\( n-1 \\), \\( n \\), or \\( n+1 \\). Since the mode is unique, it must appear more frequently than the other two numbers.\n\n### Step 2: Determine the Median\nThe median is the middle value when the list is sorted. If \\( k \\) is odd, the median is the \\(\\left(\\frac{k+1}{2}\\right)\\)-th element. If \\( k \\) is even, the median is the average of the \\(\\left(\\frac{k}{2}\\right)\\)-th and \\(\\left(\\frac{k}{2}+1\\right)\\)-th elements.\n\n### Step 3: Determine the Mean\nThe mean is the sum of the elements divided by the number of elements. We need to ensure that the mean is one of the three consecutive integers.\n\n### Step 4: Construct the List\nTo minimize the sum, we should use the smallest possible values for the integers.

We will consider the properties of circular permutations and the constraints given.\n\n### Step 1: Identify the possible number of integers\nSince the numbers are positive integers and their sum is 17, the number of integers \\( n \\) must be such that the average value of the integers is \\( \\frac{17}{n} \\). The average value must be a positive integer or a fraction that can be expressed as a sum of positive integers.\n\n### Step 2: Check possible values of \\( n \\)\nWe will check the possible values of \\( n \\) from 1 to 17 (since the sum is 17, the maximum number of integers is 17).\n\n- For \\( n = 1 \\): The only possibility is \\( 17 \\).

The number of permutations of 6 distinct elements is \\( 6! = 720 \\).\n\n### Step 4: Simplifying the Expression\nWe will consider the contributions of each term in the expression \\( A + B C + D E F \\) separately.\n\n#### Contribution of \\( A \\)\nEach zero \\( \\alpha_i \\) will appear exactly \\( 5! = 120 \\) times in the first position (as \\( A \\)) across all permutations. Therefore, the total contribution of \\( A \\) is:\n\\[\n120 (\\alpha_1 + \\alpha_2 + \\alpha_3 + \\alpha_4 + \\alpha_5 + \\alpha_6)\n\\]\n\n#### Contribution of \\( B C \\)\nEach pair \\((\\alpha_i, \\alpha_j)\\) will appear exactly \\( 4! = 24 \\) times in the positions \\( (B, C) \\) across all permutations. Therefore, the total contribution of \\( B C \\) is:\n\\[\n24 \\sum_{1 \\leq i < j \\leq 6} \\alpha_i \\alpha_j\n\\]\n\n#### Contribution of \\( D E F \\)\nEach triple \\((\\alpha_i, \\alpha_j, \\alpha_k)\\) will appear exactly \\( 3! = 6 \\) times in the positions \\( (D, E, F) \\) across all permutations. Therefore, the total contribution of \\( D E F \\) is:\n\\[\n6 \\sum_{1 \\leq i < j < k \\leq 6} \\alpha_i \\alpha_j \\alpha_k\n\\]\n\n### Step 5: Using Symmetric Sums\nWe use the fact that the coefficients of the polynomial \\( f(x) \\) are related to the elementary symmetric sums of its roots. Specifically:\n- The sum of the roots \\( \\alpha_1 + \\alpha_2 + \\alpha_3 + \\alpha_4 + \\alpha_5 + \\alpha_6 \\) is given by the coefficient of \\( x^5 \\) with a sign change, which is \\(-2\\).\n- The sum of the products of the roots taken two at a time \\( \\sum_{1 \\leq i < j \\leq 6} \\alpha_i \\alpha_j \\) is given by the coefficient of \\( x^4 \\), which is \\(3\\).\n- The sum of the products of the roots taken three at a time \\( \\sum_{1 \\leq i < j < k \\leq 6} \\alpha_i \\alpha_j \\alpha_k \\) is given by the coefficient of \\( x^3 \\) with a sign change, which is \\(-5\\).\n\n### Step 6: Calculating the Total Sum\nUsing these values, we calculate the total contributions:\n\\[\n120 (\\alpha_1 + \\alpha_2 + \\alpha_3 + \\alpha_4 + \\alpha_5 + \\alpha_6) = 120 \\times (-2) = -240\n\\]\n\\[\n24 \\sum_{1 \\leq i < j \\leq 6} \\alpha_i \\alpha_j = 24 \\times 3 = 72\n\\]\n\\[\n6 \\sum_{1 \\leq i < j < k \\leq 6} \\alpha_i \\alpha_j \\alpha_k = 6 \\times (-5) = -30\n\\]\n\n### Step 7: Summing the Contributions\nThe total sum of \\( A + B C + D E F \\) over all permutations is:\n\\[\n-240 + 72 - 30 = -198\n\\]\n\n### Step 8: Finding the Average Value\nThe average value is the total sum divided by the number of permutations:\n\\[\n\\frac{-198}{720} = -\\frac{11}{40}\n\\]\n\nThus, the average value of \\( A + B C + D E F \\) over all possible permutations is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{-\\frac{11}{40}}\n\\]"], "id": 2825, "generated_answers": ["-\\frac{11}{40}"], "gold_answer": "$-\\frac{23}{60}$", "is_correct": false, "answers_correctness": [false]}

Given that \\( \\angle B = \\angle C = 80^\\circ \\), we can deduce that \\( \\angle A = 20^\\circ \\) because the sum of the angles in a triangle is \\( 180^\\circ \\).\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the Isosceles Conditions\nFor \\( PAB \\) to be isosceles, \\( P \\) must lie on the perpendicular bisector of \\( AB \\) or \\( PA = PB \\). Similarly, for \\( PBC \\) to be isosceles, \\( P \\) must lie on the perpendicular bisector of \\( BC \\) or \\( PB = PC \\). For \\( PCA \\) to be isosceles, \\( P \\) must lie on the perpendicular bisector of \\( CA \\) or \\( PC = PA \\).\n\n### Step 2: Determine the Perpendicular Bisectors\nThe perpendicular bisectors of \\( AB \\), \\( BC \\), and \\( CA \\) intersect at the circumcenter of \\( \\triangle ABC \\). However, we need to consider the specific conditions for each triangle to be isosceles.\n\n### Step 3: Consider the Geometry of the Triangle\nSince \\( \\angle B = \\angle C = 80^\\circ \\), \\( \\triangle ABC \\) is isosceles with \\( AB = AC \\).

There are two points on this line that are equidistant from \\( B \\) and \\( C \\).\n2. **Perpendicular Bisector of \\( AB \\)**: This line passes through the midpoint of \\( AB \\) and is perpendicular to \\( AB \\).

Therefore, Kay has \\( T + 1 = 6 \\) different colors of fingernail polish.\n\n### Step-by-Step Solution:\n\n1. **Define the Problem:**\n   - We have 5 fingernails to paint.\n   - We have 6 different colors of fingernail polish.\n   - No two consecutive fingernails can have the same color.\n   - We must use at least 3 different colors.\n\n2. **Use the Principle of Inclusion-Exclusion:**\n   - First, calculate the total number of ways to paint the fingernails without any color restriction.\n   - Then, subtract the number of ways that use fewer than 3 colors.\n\n3. **Total Number of Ways Without Restriction:**\n   - For the first fingernail, there are 6 choices.\n   - For each subsequent fingernail, there are 5 choices (since it cannot be the same color as the previous one).\n   - Therefore, the total number of ways to paint the fingernails is:\n     \\[\n     6 \\times 5^4 = 6 \\times 625 = 3750\n     \\]\n\n4. **Subtract the Number of Ways Using Fewer than 3 Colors:**\n   - **Using 1 Color:**\n     - There are 6 ways to choose the color.\n     - There is only 1 way to paint all 5 fingernails with the same color.\n     - Total: \\( 6 \\times 1 = 6 \\)\n\n   - **Using 2 Colors:**\n     - Choose 2 colors out of 6: \\(\\binom{6}{2} = 15\\)\n     - For each pair of colors, we need to count the number of valid sequences of length 5 using these 2 colors.\n     - The number of valid sequences of length 5 using 2 colors (where no two consecutive colors are the same) is given by the recurrence relation for the number of binary sequences of length \\( n \\) with no two consecutive 1s:\n       \\[\n       a_n = a_{n-1} + a_{n-2}\n       \\]\n       with initial conditions \\( a_1 = 2 \\) and \\( a_2 = 2 \\).\n       - \\( a_3 = 2 + 2 = 4 \\)\n       - \\( a_4 = 4 + 2 = 6 \\)\n       - \\( a_5 = 6 + 4 = 10 \\)\n     - Therefore, there are 10 valid sequences for each pair of colors.\n     - Total: \\( 15 \\times 10 = 150 \\)\n\n5. **Calculate the Number of Valid Ways Using at Least 3 Colors:**\n   - Total number of ways without restriction: 3750\n   - Number of ways using 1 color: 6\n   - Number of ways using 2 colors: 150\n   - Number of ways using at least 3 colors:\n     \\[\n     3750 - 6 - 150 = 3594\n     \\]\n\nThus, the number of ways Kay can paint her five fingernails using at least three different colors, with no two consecutive fingernails having the same color, is \\(\\boxed{3594}\\)."], "id": 2857, "generated_answers": ["3594"], "gold_answer": "109890", "is_correct": false, "answers_correctness": [false]}

Since each of the 6 faces can be either red or blue, the total number of colorings is:\n\\[\n2^6 = 64\n\\]\n\n### Step 2: Counting Valid Colorings\nNext, we need to count the number of valid colorings where no three faces of the same color share a common vertex. We will use the principle of inclusion-exclusion to count the number of invalid colorings and then subtract this from the total number of colorings.\n\n#### Step 2.1: Counting Invalid Colorings\nAn invalid coloring is one where at least one vertex has three faces of the same color. We will count the number of such colorings by considering the different cases where this can happen.\n\n1. **Case 1: One vertex has three red faces.**\n   - There are 8 vertices on a cube.\n   - For each vertex, there are 3 faces meeting at that vertex.\n   - The number of ways to choose 3 red faces out of 6 is \\(\\binom{6}{3} = 20\\).\n   - However, not all of these 20 ways are valid because we need to ensure that the remaining 3 faces are not all the same color (i.e., not all blue).\n   - The number of valid ways to color the remaining 3 faces is \\(2^3 - 1 = 7\\) (since they cannot all be blue).\n   - Therefore, the number of invalid colorings for one vertex is \\(8 \\times 20 \\times 7 = 1120\\).\n\n2. **Case 2: One vertex has three blue faces.**\n   - This is symmetric to Case 1, so the number of invalid colorings is also 1120.\n\n3. **Case 3: Two vertices have three red faces.**\n   - There are \\(\\binom{8}{2} = 28\\) ways to choose 2 vertices.\n   - For each pair of vertices, the number of ways to color the faces is more complex, but we can use the principle of inclusion-exclusion to avoid overcounting.\n   - The number of invalid colorings for two vertices is \\(28 \\times 20 \\times 20 = 11200\\).\n\n4. **Case 4: Two vertices have three blue faces.**\n   - This is symmetric to Case 3, so the number of invalid colorings is also 11200.\n\n5. **Case 5: Four vertices have three red faces.**\n   - There are \\(\\binom{8}{4} = 70\\) ways to choose 4 vertices.\n   - The number of invalid colorings for four vertices is \\(70 \\times 20 \\times 20 \\times 20 = 56000\\).\n\n6. **Case 6: Four vertices have three blue faces.**\n   - This is symmetric to Case 5, so the number of invalid colorings is also 56000.\n\n### Step 3: Applying Inclusion-Exclusion Principle\nUsing the principle of inclusion-exclusion, we sum the number of invalid colorings and subtract the overcounted cases:\n\\[\n1120 + 1120 + 11200 + 11200 + 56000 + 56000 = 136000\n\\]\n\n### Step 4: Correcting for Overcounting\nWe need to correct for overcounting by considering the cases where more than one vertex has three faces of the same color.

Let's denote the state of the switches after \\( m \\) minutes as a binary vector of length 7, where 1 represents an on switch and 0 represents an off switch.\n\n### Step 3: Formulating the Problem Mathematically\nEach minute, Elizabeth flips 3 switches. This can be represented as adding a vector of 3 ones and 4 zeros to the current state vector (mod 2). We need to find the minimum number of such additions that result in the all-ones vector \\((1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1)\\).\n\n### Step 4: Using Linear Algebra\nWe can represent the problem using linear algebra over the field \\(\\mathbb{F}_2\\) (the field with two elements, 0 and 1). We need to find the minimum number of vectors from the set of all possible 3-switch flips that sum to the all-ones vector.\n\n### Step 5: Constructing the Solution\nWe can use the fact that the sum of all possible 3-switch flips (each flip is a vector with exactly 3 ones) will eventually cover all possible states. However, we need to find the minimum number of such flips to reach the all-ones vector.\n\n### Step 6: Using Combinatorial Arguments\nWe can use combinatorial arguments to determine the minimum number of minutes. Each minute, 3 switches are flipped, and we need to cover all 7 switches. We can use the fact that the sum of the number of times each switch is flipped must be odd for it to be on at the end.\n\n### Step 7: Calculating the Minimum Number of Minutes\nWe can use the fact that the minimum number of minutes required to turn on all 7 switches by flipping exactly 3 switches each minute is given by the formula:\n\\[ E(n, k) = \\left\\lceil \\frac{n}{k} \\right\\rceil \\]\n\nFor \\( n = 7 \\) and \\( k = 3 \\):\n\\[ E(7, 3) = \\left\\lceil \\frac{7}{3} \\right\\rceil = \\left\\lceil 2.3333 \\right\\rceil = 3 \\]\n\n### Step 8: Verifying the Solution\nWe can verify this by considering the sequence of flips:\n- In the first minute, flip switches 1, 2, and 3.\n- In the second minute, flip switches 4, 5, and 6.\n- In the third minute, flip switches 1, 2, and 7.\n\nAfter 3 minutes, all 7 switches will be on.\n\nThus, the minimum number of minutes required for Elizabeth to escape is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{3}\n\\]"], "id": 2993, "generated_answers": ["3"], "gold_answer": "3", "is_correct": true, "answers_correctness": [true]}
