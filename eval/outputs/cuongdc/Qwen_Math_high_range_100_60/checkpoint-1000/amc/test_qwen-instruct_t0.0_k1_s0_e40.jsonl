This is a classic problem related to the Frobenius coin problem, which deals with finding the largest number that cannot be expressed as a non-negative integer combination of two given coprime integers.\n\nFirst, let's check if 6, 10, and 15 are coprime. Two numbers are coprime if their greatest common divisor (gcd) is 1. We can find the gcd of these numbers:\n- gcd(6, 10) = 2\n- gcd(6, 15) = 3\n- gcd(10, 15) = 5\n\nSince 6, 10, and 15 are not coprime, we cannot directly apply the Frobenius coin problem formula for two coprime numbers. Instead, we need to find the largest number that cannot be expressed as a combination of 6, 10, and 15.\n\nTo do this, we can use the fact that any number that can be expressed as a combination of 6, 10, and 15 must be a multiple of the gcd of these numbers. The gcd of 6, 10, and 15 is 1, so any number can be expressed as a combination of these coins if it is large enough.\n\nHowever, we need to find the largest number that cannot be expressed.
