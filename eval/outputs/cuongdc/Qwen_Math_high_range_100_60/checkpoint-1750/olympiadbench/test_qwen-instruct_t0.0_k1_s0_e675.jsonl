Therefore, the system of congruences will have a unique solution modulo 5000.\n\n5. **Determining the Number of Moves:**\n   - To determine \\( N \\) uniquely, Sergey needs to provide enough information to distinguish between all possible values of \\( N \\) from 1 to 5000.\n   - Each move provides information about 20 values \\( a_k \\), but we need to determine \\( N \\) modulo 5000.\n   - The number of moves required is the number of distinct sets of 20 values that can be formed from the 20 indices.\n\n6. **Calculating the Number of Moves:**\n   - The number of distinct sets of 20 values that can be formed from 20 indices is \\( 2^{20} \\).\n   - However, we need to determine the minimum number of moves to uniquely identify \\( N \\) within the range 1 to 5000.\n   - Since each move provides 20 pieces of information, and we need to distinguish between 5000 possible values, we can use the fact that \\( 2^{10} = 1024 \\) and \\( 2^{11} = 2048 \\).\n\n7. **Conclusion:**\n   - To uniquely determine \\( N \\) within the range 1 to 5000, Sergey needs at least 11 moves, as \\( 2^{11} = 2048 \\) is the smallest power of 2 greater than 5000.\n\nTherefore, the minimum number of moves Sergey needs to determine \\( N \\) for sure is \\(\\boxed{11}\\)."], "id": 1606, "generated_answers": ["11"], "gold_answer": "2", "is_correct": false, "answers_correctness": [false]}

For example, the number 5 in binary is \\(101_2\\), so its weight is 2.\n\n### Step 2: Counting Numbers with Even and Odd Weights\nWe need to count the number of positive integers up to \\(2^{2017}\\) that have an even weight and those that have an odd weight.\n\n### Step 3: Total Number of Positive Integers\nThe total number of positive integers up to \\(2^{2017}\\) is \\(2^{2017} - 1\\).\n\n### Step 4: Symmetry in Binary Representation\nConsider the binary representation of numbers from 0 to \\(2^{2017} - 1\\).

The total number of 2017-bit binary strings is \\(2^{2017}\\).\n\n### Step 6: Counting Even and Odd Weighted Numbers\nSince the total number of 2017-bit binary strings is \\(2^{2017}\\), and each bit (0 or 1) is equally likely to appear, the number of 2017-bit binary strings with an even number of 1s is equal to the number of those with an odd number of 1s. This is because the parity of the number of 1s is equally distributed.\n\n### Step 7: Subtracting 1 for the Number 0\nThe number 0 (which is not a positive integer) has a weight of 0, which is even.

However, since the condition in part (a) is not provided, we will assume it is a standard condition for cubic sequences, which is that the sequence is symmetric about some integer \\(k\\). This means that \\(a_{k+n} = a_{k-n}\\) for all integers \\(n\\).\n\nGiven this symmetry, we can infer that the cubic sequence \\(a_n = n^3 + bn^2 + cn + d\\) must have a specific form. The symmetry condition implies that the sequence is symmetric about some integer \\(k\\), and the only cubic polynomial that is symmetric about an integer is of the form \\(a_n = (n-k)^3 + c\\). This is because the term \\(n^3\\) is the only term that can be symmetric about an integer, and the other terms must be adjusted to maintain the symmetry.\n\nLet's assume the sequence is symmetric about \\(k = 0\\), which simplifies the form to \\(a_n = n^3 + c\\).

Since \\(c\\) is an integer, the expression \\((2015^3 + c)(2016^3 + c)\\) will be an integer. The specific value of \\(c\\) does not change the fact that the product is an integer, so the possible values of \\(a_{2015} \\cdot a_{2016}\\) are all integers.\n\nHowever, the problem asks for the possible values, and since \\(c\\) can be any integer, the product \\((2015^3 + c)(2016^3 + c)\\) can take on any integer value.

In other words, no two kings can be adjacent horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.\n2. **Each Row and Column Contains Exactly 25 Kings**: This implies a uniform distribution of kings across the board.\n\n### Step 2: Placing Kings in a Non-Capturing Manner\nTo ensure no two kings can capture each other, we can place the kings in a checkerboard pattern. In a checkerboard pattern, each king is placed in a square such that no two kings are adjacent. This pattern naturally satisfies the non-capturing condition.\n\n### Step 3: Ensuring Uniform Distribution\nWe need to ensure that each row and each column contains exactly 25 kings. In a \\(100 \\times 100\\) chessboard, a checkerboard pattern will place kings in every other square. This means:\n- In a \\(100 \\times 100\\) board, there are 5000 squares.\n- In a checkerboard pattern, half of these squares will be occupied by kings, which is 2500 squares.\n\n### Step 4: Verifying the Distribution\n- **Rows**: In each row, there are 100 squares. In a checkerboard pattern, every other square is occupied, so each row will have \\( \\frac{100}{2} = 50 \\) kings.\n- **Columns**: Similarly, in each column, there are 100 squares, and each column will also have \\( \\frac{100}{2} = 50 \\) kings.\n\nHowever, we need each row and each column to contain exactly 25 kings. To achieve this, we can modify the checkerboard pattern by shifting it in a specific way. Specifically, we can shift the pattern by 25 squares in either the row or column direction.\n\n### Step 5: Shifting the Checkerboard Pattern\n- **Horizontal Shift**: Shift the checkerboard pattern by 25 squares to the right.\n- **Vertical Shift**: Shift the checkerboard pattern by 25 squares downward.\n\nBy shifting the pattern in this manner, we ensure that each row and each column contains exactly 25 kings while maintaining the non-capturing condition.\n\n### Step 6: Counting the Arrangements\nSince the problem specifies that arrangements differing by rotation or symmetry are considered different, we need to consider all possible shifts. There are 4 possible shifts (0, 25, 50, 75 squares in both the row and column directions).\n\nThus, the number of such arrangements is:\n\\[\n4 \\times 4 = 16\n\\]\n\n### Final Answer\n\\[\n\\boxed{16}\n\\]"], "id": 1724, "generated_answers": ["16"], "gold_answer": "2", "is_correct": false, "answers_correctness": [false]}

Each cell contains a distinct divisor.\n2. The sum of the divisors in each row is the same.\n3. The sum of the divisors in each column is the same.\n\n### Step 2: Sum of Divisors\nLet \\( d_1, d_2, \\ldots, d_k \\) be the divisors of \\( n \\). The sum of all divisors of \\( n \\) is denoted by \\( \\sigma(n) \\).\n\n### Step 3: Row and Column Sums\nIf the table has \\( r \\) rows and \\( c \\) columns, then:\n- The sum of the divisors in each row is \\( \\frac{\\sigma(n)}{r} \\).\n- The sum of the divisors in each column is \\( \\frac{\\sigma(n)}{c} \\).\n\nFor these sums to be equal, we must have:\n\\[ \\frac{\\sigma(n)}{r} = \\frac{\\sigma(n)}{c} \\]\nThis implies:\n\\[ r = c \\]\n\n### Step 4: Perfect Squares\nSince \\( r = c \\), the number of divisors \\( k \\) must be a perfect square. Let \\( k = m^2 \\) for some integer \\( m \\).\n\n### Step 5: Divisors of \\( n \\)\nThe number of divisors of \\( n \\) is given by:\n\\[ k = (e_1 + 1)(e_2 + 1) \\cdots (e_k + 1) \\]\nwhere \\( n = p_1^{e_1} p_2^{e_2} \\cdots p_k^{e_k} \\) is the prime factorization of \\( n \\).\n\nFor \\( k \\) to be a perfect square, each \\( e_i + 1 \\) must be a perfect square.

In the worst case, George's strategy might not always choose the optimal number at each step, but it will still ensure that the absolute value of the partial sum is minimized at each step.\n\nLet's analyze the partial sums step by step:\n- At each step, George chooses the number that minimizes the absolute value of the partial sum.\n- The maximum absolute partial sum \\(G\\) that George can achieve is at most twice the minimum maximum absolute partial sum \\(D\\) that Dave can achieve.\n\nThis is because, in the worst case, George might end up with a partial sum that is at most twice the minimum maximum absolute partial sum \\(D\\). This is because the worst-case scenario for George is that he might end up with a partial sum that is the sum of the two largest numbers in absolute value, which is at most twice the maximum absolute partial sum \\(D\\).\n\n### Step 5: Conclusion\nThus, the least possible constant \\(c\\) such that \\(G \\leq cD\\) for all possible sequences of \\(n\\) real numbers is \\(c = 2\\).\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{2}\n\\]"], "id": 1968, "generated_answers": ["2"], "gold_answer": "2", "is_correct": true, "answers_correctness": [true]}

We need to find a subsequence where the indices are at most 2 apart, and the absolute sum of the elements in this subsequence is at least \\( C \\).\n\n### Step 2: Considering the Maximum Possible Sum\nThe maximum possible sum of the entire sequence is 2022 (if all elements are +1), and the minimum possible sum is -2022 (if all elements are -1). However, we are looking for a subsequence with a specific property.\n\n### Step 3: Analyzing the Subsequence Constraints\nWe need to find a subsequence where the indices are at most 2 apart. This means we can consider every third element in the sequence. For example, we can consider the subsequence \\( a_1, a_3, a_5, \\ldots, a_{2021} \\) or \\( a_2, a_4, a_6, \\ldots, a_{2022} \\).\n\n### Step 4: Calculating the Number of Elements in the Subsequence\nThe number of elements in the subsequence \\( a_1, a_3, a_5, \\ldots, a_{2021} \\) is 1011 (since it includes every third element starting from 1 and ending at 2021). Similarly, the number of elements in the subsequence \\( a_2, a_4, a_6, \\ldots, a_{2022} \\) is also 1011.\n\n### Step 5: Estimating the Sum of the Subsequence\nThe sum of the elements in any subsequence of 1011 elements can range from -1011 to 1011. However, we need to find the minimum absolute value of the sum of such a subsequence.\n\n### Step 6: Using the Pigeonhole Principle\nConsider the partial sums \\( S_i = \\sum_{j=1}^{i} a_j \\) for \\( i = 1, 2, \\ldots, 2022 \\). These partial sums can take any integer value between -2022 and 2022. Since there are 2023 possible values for \\( S_i \\) and only 2022 indices, by the pigeonhole principle, there must be at least one value of \\( S_i \\) that is repeated.\n\n### Step 7: Finding the Subsequence with the Desired Property\nIf \\( S_i = S_j \\) for some \\( i < j \\), then the sum of the elements from \\( a_{i+1} \\) to \\( a_j \\) is zero. We can then consider the subsequence from \\( a_{i+1} \\) to \\( a_j \\) and split it into subsequences of length at most 2. The sum of these subsequences will still be zero, and we can find a subsequence of length at most 2 with a non-zero sum.\n\n### Step 8: Determining the Minimum Absolute Sum\nThe minimum absolute sum of a subsequence of length at most 2 is 1 (since the elements are either +1 or -1). Therefore, the largest \\( C \\) such that the absolute sum of the subsequence is at least \\( C \\) is 674.\n\n### Final Answer\n\\[\n\\boxed{674}\n\\]"], "id": 2004, "generated_answers": ["674"], "gold_answer": "506", "is_correct": false, "answers_correctness": [false]}

This means a knight can attack any square that is two squares away in one direction and one square away in the perpendicular direction.\n\n### Step 2: Placing Knights on the Board\nTo maximize the number of knights on the board without any attacks, we need to place the knights in such a way that no two knights are within the knight's attack range.\n\n### Step 3: Chessboard Coloring\nA useful strategy is to color the chessboard in a checkerboard pattern, where each square is either black or white.

Any triangle inscribed in this circle will have its vertices on the circumference of the circle. The perimeter of such a triangle is the sum of the lengths of its three sides.\n\n### Step 2: Perimeter of an Inscribed Triangle\nFor an inscribed triangle, the perimeter \\( P \\) is given by:\n\\[ P = a + b + c \\]\nwhere \\( a \\), \\( b \\), and \\( c \\) are the lengths of the sides of the triangle. Since the triangle is inscribed in a circle of radius 1, the maximum possible length of any side of the triangle is the diameter of the circle, which is 2.\n\n### Step 3: Maximum Perimeter of an Inscribed Triangle\nThe maximum perimeter of an inscribed triangle occurs when the triangle is equilateral. For an equilateral triangle inscribed in a circle of radius 1, each side length \\( s \\) can be calculated using the formula for the side length of an equilateral triangle inscribed in a circle:\n\\[ s = \\sqrt{3} \\]\nThus, the perimeter of an equilateral triangle is:\n\\[ P_{\\text{max}} = 3s = 3\\sqrt{3} \\]\n\n### Step 4: Condition for the Perimeter\nWe need to find all positive real numbers \\( t \\) such that for each positive integer \\( n \\), there exists a good collection of \\( n \\) triangles, each with a perimeter greater than \\( t \\).\n\n### Step 5: Analyzing the Perimeter Constraint\nSince the maximum perimeter of any inscribed triangle is \\( 3\\sqrt{3} \\), for any \\( t \\) greater than \\( 3\\sqrt{3} \\), it is impossible to have a triangle with a perimeter greater than \\( t \\).

Two resident cycles are indistinguishable if they contain the same residents (in any order), and distinguishable otherwise. For example, if $r_{1}, r_{2}, r_{3}, r_{4}$ is a resident cycle, then $r_{2}, r_{1}, r_{4}, r_{3}$ and $r_{3}, r_{2}, r_{1}, r_{4}$ are indistinguishable resident cycles.\nCompute the number of distinguishable resident cycles of length 6 in $\\mathcal{F}_{8}$.", "generated_responses": ["To solve the problem, we need to determine the number of distinguishable resident cycles of length 6 in a full town \\(\\mathcal{F}_8\\) where the residents collectively know how to make 8 dishes.

Each dish is known by \\(\\text{pop}(\\mathcal{F}_8)/2\\) residents, so the total number of \"resident-dish\" pairs is also \\(8 \\times \\text{pop}(\\mathcal{F}_8)/2 = 4 \\times \\text{pop}(\\mathcal{F}_8)\\). Equating the two expressions, we get:\n\\[\n2 \\times \\text{pop}(\\mathcal{F}_8) = 4 \\times \\text{pop}(\\mathcal{F}_8)/2\n\\]\nThis simplifies to:\n\\[\n2 \\times \\text{pop}(\\mathcal{F}_8) = 4 \\times \\text{pop}(\\mathcal{F}_8)/2\n\\]\n\\[\n2 \\times \\text{pop}(\\mathcal{F}_8) = 2 \\times \\text{pop}(\\mathcal{F}_8)\n\\]\nThis equation is always true, so we need to find the number of residents. Since each dish is known by exactly 4 residents, and there are 8 dishes, the total number of residents is:\n\\[\n\\text{pop}(\\mathcal{F}_8) = 8 \\times 4 / 2 = 16\n\\]\n\n### Step 3: Counting the Resident Cycles\nA resident cycle of length 6 is a sequence of 6 distinct residents such that each pair of consecutive residents in the cycle knows a common dish, and no other pair of residents in the cycle know a common dish. This is equivalent to finding a 6-cycle in the bipartite graph \\(K_{8, 16}\\).\n\n### Step 4: Counting the Distinguishable 6-Cycles\nTo count the number of distinguishable 6-cycles, we need to consider the structure of the bipartite graph. Each 6-cycle in the bipartite graph corresponds to a sequence of 6 dishes and 6 residents, where each resident knows exactly 2 dishes and each dish is known by exactly 4 residents.\n\nThe number of ways to choose 6 dishes out of 8 is given by:\n\\[\n\\binom{8}{6} = 28\n\\]\nFor each set of 6 dishes, we need to count the number of ways to form a 6-cycle. Each 6-cycle can be represented as a permutation of 6 dishes, and there are \\(6!\\) permutations of 6 dishes. However, since the cycle is indistinguishable from its reverse, we divide by 2:\n\\[\n\\frac{6!}{2} = 360\n\\]\nThus, the total number of 6-cycles is:\n\\[\n28 \\times 360 = 10080\n\\]\n\n### Step 5: Adjusting for Distinguishability\nSince we are asked for the number of distinguishable resident cycles, we need to account for the fact that the cycles are indistinguishable if they contain the same residents in any order. Each cycle can be represented in 6 different ways (one for each starting resident), so we divide by 6:\n\\[\n\\frac{10080}{6} = 1680\n\\]\n\nThus, the number of distinguishable resident cycles of length 6 in \\(\\mathcal{F}_8\\) is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{1680}\n\\]"], "id": 2625, "generated_answers": ["1680"], "gold_answer": "1680", "is_correct": true, "answers_correctness": [true]}
{"question": "In each town in ARMLandia, the residents have formed groups, which meet each week to share math problems and enjoy each others' company over a potluck-style dinner. Each town resident belongs to exactly one group. Every week, each resident is required to make one dish and to bring it to his/her group.\n\nIt so happens that each resident knows how to make precisely two dishes. Moreover, no two residents of a town know how to make the same pair of dishes. Shown below are two example towns. In the left column are the names of the town's residents. Adjacent to each name is the list of dishes that the corresponding resident knows how to make.\n\n| ARMLton |  |\n| :--- | :--- |\n| Resident | Dishes |\n| Paul | pie, turkey |\n| Arnold | pie, salad |\n| Kelly | salad, broth |\n\n\n| ARMLville |  |\n| :--- | :--- |\n| Resident | Dishes |\n| Sally | steak, calzones |\n| Ross | calzones, pancakes |\n| David | steak, pancakes |\n\nThe population of a town $T$, denoted $\\operatorname{pop}(T)$, is the number of residents of $T$. Formally, the town itself is simply the set of its residents, denoted by $\\left\\{r_{1}, \\ldots, r_{\\mathrm{pop}(T)}\\right\\}$ unless otherwise specified. The set of dishes that the residents of $T$ collectively know how to make is denoted $\\operatorname{dish}(T)$. For example, in the town of ARMLton described above, pop(ARMLton) $=3$, and dish(ARMLton) $=$ \\{pie, turkey, salad, broth\\}.\n\nA town $T$ is called full if for every pair of dishes in $\\operatorname{dish}(T)$, there is exactly one resident in $T$ who knows how to make those two dishes. In the examples above, ARMLville is a full town, but ARMLton is not, because (for example) nobody in ARMLton knows how to make both turkey and salad.\n\nDenote by $\\mathcal{F}_{d}$ a full town in which collectively the residents know how to make $d$ dishes. That is, $\\left|\\operatorname{dish}\\left(\\mathcal{F}_{d}\\right)\\right|=d$.\n\nIn order to avoid the embarrassing situation where two people bring the same dish to a group dinner, if two people know how to make a common dish, they are forbidden from participating in the same group meeting. Formally, a group assignment on $T$ is a function $f: T \\rightarrow\\{1,2, \\ldots, k\\}$, satisfying the condition that if $f\\left(r_{i}\\right)=f\\left(r_{j}\\right)$ for $i \\neq j$, then $r_{i}$ and $r_{j}$ do not know any of the same recipes. The group number of a town $T$, denoted $\\operatorname{gr}(T)$, is the least positive integer $k$ for which there exists a group assignment on $T$.\n\nFor example, consider once again the town of ARMLton. A valid group assignment would be $f($ Paul $)=f($ Kelly $)=1$ and $f($ Arnold $)=2$. The function which gives the value 1 to each resident of ARMLton is not a group assignment, because Paul and Arnold must be assigned to different groups.\n\n\nFor a dish $D$, a resident is called a $D$-chef if he or she knows how to make the dish $D$. Define $\\operatorname{chef}_{T}(D)$ to be the set of residents in $T$ who are $D$-chefs. For example, in ARMLville, David is a steak-chef and a pancakes-chef. Further, $\\operatorname{chef}_{\\text {ARMLville }}($ steak $)=\\{$ Sally, David $\\}$.\n\n\nIf $\\operatorname{gr}(T)=\\left|\\operatorname{chef}_{T}(D)\\right|$ for some $D \\in \\operatorname{dish}(T)$, then $T$ is called homogeneous. If $\\operatorname{gr}(T)>\\left|\\operatorname{chef}_{T}(D)\\right|$ for each dish $D \\in \\operatorname{dish}(T)$, then $T$ is called heterogeneous. For example, ARMLton is homogeneous, because $\\operatorname{gr}($ ARMLton $)=2$ and exactly two chefs make pie, but ARMLville is heterogeneous, because even though each dish is only cooked by two chefs, $\\operatorname{gr}($ ARMLville $)=3$.\n\n\nA resident cycle is a sequence of distinct residents $r_{1}, \\ldots, r_{n}$ such that for each $1 \\leq i \\leq n-1$, the residents $r_{i}$ and $r_{i+1}$ know how to make a common dish, residents $r_{n}$ and $r_{1}$ know how to make a common dish, and no other pair of residents $r_{i}$ and $r_{j}, 1 \\leq i, j \\leq n$ know how to make a common dish. Two resident cycles are indistinguishable if they contain the same residents (in any order), and distinguishable otherwise. For example, if $r_{1}, r_{2}, r_{3}, r_{4}$ is a resident cycle, then $r_{2}, r_{1}, r_{4}, r_{3}$ and $r_{3}, r_{2}, r_{1}, r_{4}$ are indistinguishable resident cycles.\nIn terms of $k$ and $d$, find the number of distinguishable resident cycles of length $k$ in $\\mathcal{F}_{d}$.", "generated_responses": ["To solve the problem, we need to determine the number of distinguishable resident cycles of length \\( k \\) in a full town \\(\\mathcal{F}_d\\) where \\( k \\) is the group number and \\( d \\) is the number of dishes.\n\n### Step-by-Step Solution:\n\n1. **Understanding the Problem:**\n   - A full town \\(\\mathcal{F}_d\\) has \\( d \\) dishes.\n   - Each resident knows exactly 2 dishes.\n   - No two residents know the same pair of dishes.\n   - The group number \\(\\operatorname{gr}(\\mathcal{F}_d) = k\\).\n   - We need to find the number of distinguishable resident cycles of length \\( k \\).\n\n2. **Properties of a Full Town:**\n   - Since each resident knows exactly 2 dishes, and no two residents know the same pair of dishes, the number of residents in \\(\\mathcal{F}_d\\) is \\(\\binom{d}{2}\\).\n   - Each dish is known by exactly \\( k \\) residents because \\(\\operatorname{gr}(\\mathcal{F}_d) = k\\).\n\n3. ** Resident Cycles:**\n   - A resident cycle of length \\( k \\) is a sequence of \\( k \\) distinct residents \\( r_1, r_2, \\ldots, r_k \\) such that:\n     - \\( r_i \\) and \\( r_{i+1} \\) know a common dish for \\( 1 \\leq i \\leq k-1 \\).\n     - \\( r_k \\) and \\( r_1 \\) know a common dish.\n     - No other pair of residents \\( r_i \\) and \\( r_j \\) know a common dish.\n\n4. **Counting Distinguishable Resident Cycles:**\n   - Each resident cycle of length \\( k \\) corresponds to a Hamiltonian cycle in a bipartite graph where:\n     - One set of vertices represents the \\( d \\) dishes.\n     - The other set of vertices represents the \\( k \\) residents in the cycle.\n     - An edge exists between a dish and a resident if the resident knows that dish.\n   - The number of Hamiltonian cycles in a complete bipartite graph \\( K_{d, k} \\) is given by:\n     \\[\n     (d-1)! \\cdot k\n     \\]\n   - However, since we are considering distinguishable cycles, we need to account for the fact that each cycle can be traversed in \\( k \\) different ways (starting from any of the \\( k \\) residents).\n\n5. **Final Calculation:**\n   - The number of distinguishable resident cycles of length \\( k \\) is:\n     \\[\n     \\frac{(d-1)! \\cdot k}{k} = (d-1)!\n     \\]\n\n### Final Answer:\n\\[\n\\boxed{(d-1)!}\n\\]"], "id": 2626, "generated_answers": ["(d-1)!"], "gold_answer": "$\\frac{d !}{2 k(d-k) !}$", "is_correct": false, "answers_correctness": [false]}

However, since the problem is symmetric and the legs are of different lengths, we can consider the effective area of these quarter-circles within the triangle.\n\n   The total area of the quarter-circles within the triangle is:\n   \\[\n   \\pi + \\pi + \\pi = 3\\pi\n   \\]\n\n5. **Calculate the probability \\( p \\):**\n   The probability \\( p \\) is the ratio of the total area of the quarter-circles within the triangle to the area of the triangle:\n   \\[\n   p = \\frac{3\\pi}{4\\sqrt{3}}\n   \\]\n\n6. **Simplify the expression:**\n   To simplify \\( \\frac{3\\pi}{4\\sqrt{3}} \\), we rationalize the denominator:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{3\\pi}{4\\sqrt{3}} \\times \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{\\sqrt{3}} = \\frac{3\\pi \\sqrt{3}}{12} = \\frac{\\pi \\sqrt{3}}{4}\n   \\]\n\n   Therefore, the probability \\( p \\) can be written as:\n   \\[\n   p = \\frac{\\pi \\sqrt{3}}{4}\n   \\]\n\n7. **Express \\( p \\) in the form \\( a + \\sqrt{b} \\pi \\):**\n   Here, \\( a = 0 \\) and \\( b = \\frac{3}{4} \\).

{"question": "David builds a circular table; he then carves one or more positive integers into the table at points equally spaced around its circumference. He considers two tables to be the same if one can be rotated so that it has the same numbers in the same positions as the other.

Given that the numbers he carves sum to 17 , compute the number of different tables he can make.", "generated_responses": ["To solve the problem, we need to determine the number of distinct circular arrangements of positive integers that sum to 17. We will consider the following steps:\n\n1. **Identify the possible number of integers:**\n   - The sum of the integers is 17. The minimum number of integers is 1 (which is not possible since the sum would be 17, not a single number).\n   - The maximum number of integers is 17 (each being 1).\n\n2. **Consider the number of integers \\( n \\):**\n   - For \\( n = 2 \\): The pairs of integers that sum to 17 are (1, 16), (2, 15), (3, 14), (4, 13), (5, 12), (6, 11), (7, 10), and (8, 9). Each pair can be arranged in 2 ways (e.g., (1, 16) and (16, 1)), but since the table is circular, (1, 16) and (16, 1) are considered the same. Thus, there are 8 distinct tables.\n   - For \\( n = 3 \\): We need to find all sets of three integers that sum to 17. The possible sets are (1, 2, 14), (1, 3, 13), (1, 4, 12), (1, 5, 11), (1, 6, 10), (1, 7, 9), (2, 3, 12), (2, 4, 11), (2, 5, 10), (2, 6, 9), (2, 7, 8), (3, 4, 10), (3, 5, 9), (3, 6, 8), (4, 5, 8), and (4, 6, 7). Each set can be arranged in 3! = 6 ways, but since the table is circular, each arrangement is counted 3 times. Thus, there are \\( \\frac{16 \\times 6}{3} = 32 \\) distinct tables.\n   - For \\( n = 4 \\): We need to find all sets of four integers that sum to 17. The possible sets are (1, 2, 3, 11), (1, 2, 4, 10), (1, 2, 5, 9), (1, 2, 6, 8), (1, 3, 4, 9), (1, 3, 5, 8), (1, 3, 6, 7), (1, 4, 5, 7), (2, 3, 4, 8), and (2, 3, 5, 7).

Each set can be arranged in 6! = 720 ways, but since the table is circular, each arrangement is counted 6 times.

The only possible set is (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 0), but 0 is not a positive integer. Thus, there are 0 distinct tables.\n   - For \\( n = 8 \\): We need to find all sets of eight integers that sum to 17. The only possible set is (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, -1), but -1 is not a positive integer.

The only possible set is (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, -5), but -5 is not a positive integer.

We can write:\n\\[\nr = \\frac{AB_7}{66_7}\n\\]\nwhere \\( AB_7 \\) is the two-digit number in base-7 and \\( 66_7 \\) is the base-7 equivalent of 48 in base-10.\n\n### Step 3: Convert \\( AB_7 \\) and \\( 66_7 \\) to base-10\nFirst, convert \\( AB_7 \\) to base-10:\n\\[\nAB_7 = 7A + B\n\\]\n\nNext, convert \\( 66_7 \\) to base-10:\n\\[\n66_7 = 6 \\cdot 7 + 6 = 42 + 6 = 48\n\\]\n\n### Step 4: Write \\( r \\) as a fraction in base-10\nNow, we have:\n\\[\nr = \\frac{7A + B}{48}\n\\]\n\n### Step 5: Find the largest \\( r \\) less than 1\nTo find the largest \\( r \\) less than 1, we need \\( 7A + B \\) to be the largest possible value less than 48. Since \\( A \\) and \\( B \\) are digits in base-7, they range from 0 to 6. The largest value of \\( 7A + B \\) is when \\( A = 6 \\) and \\( B = 6 \\):\n\\[\n7 \\cdot 6 + 6 = 42 + 6 = 48\n\\]\nHowever, \\( 48 \\) is not less than 48, so we need to use the next largest value. The next largest value is when \\( A = 6 \\) and \\( B = 5 \\):\n\\[\n7 \\cdot 6 + 5 = 42 + 5 = 47\n\\]\n\n### Step 6: Write \\( r \\) as a reduced fraction\nThus, the largest \\( r \\) less than 1 is:\n\\[\nr = \\frac{47}{48}\n\\]\n\n### Step 7: Compute \\( p + q \\)\nHere, \\( p = 47 \\) and \\( q = 48 \\). Therefore:\n\\[\np + q = 47 + 48 = 95\n\\]\n\n### Final Answer\n\\[\n\\boxed{95}\n\\]"], "id": 2797, "generated_answers": ["95"], "gold_answer": "95", "is_correct": true, "answers_correctness": [true]}

This is given by the Fibonacci number \\( F_6 \\) (since the number of valid sequences of length \\( n \\) is \\( F_{n+2} \\)).\n\n\\[\nF_6 = 8\n\\]\n\nThus, the number of colorings using exactly two colors is:\n\\[\n\\binom{T + 1}{2} \\cdot 8\n\\]\n\n### Step 3: Apply the Principle of Inclusion-Exclusion\nThe number of valid colorings using at least three colors is:\n\\[\n(T + 1) \\cdot T^4 - \\binom{T + 1}{2} \\cdot 8\n\\]\n\n### Step 4: Simplify the Expression\n\\[\n(T + 1) \\cdot T^4 - \\frac{(T + 1)T}{2} \\cdot 8\n\\]\n\\[\n= (T + 1) \\cdot T^4 - 4T(T + 1)\n\\]\n\\[\n= (T + 1)(T^4 - 4T)\n\\]\n\\[\n= (T + 1)T(T^3 - 4)\n\\]\n\n### Final Answer\n\\[\n\\boxed{(T + 1)T(T^3 - 4)}\n\\]"], "id": 2857, "generated_answers": ["(T + 1)T(T^3 - 4)"], "gold_answer": "109890", "is_correct": false, "answers_correctness": [false]}

Let's proceed step by step.\n\n1. **Determine the side length of the square:**\n   The area of the square is given as 650. The side length \\(s\\) of the square can be found using the formula for the area of a square:\n   \\[\n   s^2 = 650 \\implies s = \\sqrt{650} = 5\\sqrt{26}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Identify the coordinates of the vertices of the square:**\n   Let the vertices of the square be \\(A, B, C,\\) and \\(D\\) in a clockwise order. Given that \\(A = (11, 5)\\), we need to find the coordinates of the other vertices. Since \\(A, R, M,\\) and \\(L\\) are midpoints of the sides, we can use the properties of the square to find the coordinates of the vertices.\n\n3. **Find the coordinates of the midpoints:**\n   Let the coordinates of the vertices be:\n   \\[\n   A = (11, 5), \\quad B = (x_1, y_1), \\quad C = (x_2, y_2), \\quad D = (x_3, y_3)\n   \\]\n   The midpoints \\(R, M,\\) and \\(L\\) are:\n   \\[\n   R = \\left( \\frac{11 + x_1}{2}, \\frac{5 + y_1}{2} \\right), \\quad M = \\left( \\frac{x_1 + x_2}{2}, \\frac{y_1 + y_2}{2} \\right), \\quad L = \\left( \\frac{x_2 + x_3}{2}, \\frac{y_2 + y_3}{2} \\right)\n   \\]\n\n4. **Use the properties of the square:**\n   Since \\(A, R, M,\\) and \\(L\\) are midpoints, the side length of the square is \\(5\\sqrt{26}\\). The coordinates of the midpoints must be lattice points, and \\(R\\) is in Quadrant I.\n\n5. **Determine the possible coordinates for \\(R\\):**\n   The coordinates of \\(R\\) must be of the form \\((x, y)\\) where \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) are integers. Since \\(R\\) is a midpoint, we have:\n   \\[\n   x = \\frac{11 + x_1}{2}, \\quad y = \\frac{5 + y_1}{2}\n   \\]\n   For \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) to be integers, \\(11 + x_1\\) and \\(5 + y_1\\) must be even. Therefore, \\(x_1\\) must be odd and \\(y_1\\) must be odd.\n\n6. **Calculate the number of possible pairs \\((x_1, y_1)\\):**\n   The side length of the square is \\(5\\sqrt{26}\\), and the coordinates of \\(B\\) must be such that the distance from \\(A\\) to \\(B\\) is \\(5\\sqrt{26}\\). The possible integer coordinates for \\(B\\) are:\n   \\[\n   (11 + 5\\sqrt{26} \\cos \\theta, 5 + 5\\sqrt{26} \\sin \\theta)\n   \\]\n   where \\(\\theta\\) is the angle between the side of the square and the x-axis. Since \\(x_1\\) and \\(y_1\\) must be odd, we need to count the number of integer solutions for \\(x_1\\) and \\(y_1\\) that satisfy the distance condition.\n\n7. **Count the valid pairs:**\n   The number of valid pairs \\((x_1, y_1)\\) is determined by the number of integer solutions to the equation:\n   \\[\n   (x_1 - 11)^2 + (y_1 - 5)^2 = (5\\sqrt{26})^2 = 650\n   \\]\n   This is a circle with radius \\(5\\sqrt{26}\\) centered at \\((11, 5)\\). The number of lattice points on this circle is 12 (since the circle is symmetric and each quadrant has 3 points).\n\n8. **Conclusion:**\n   Since \\(R\\) is in Quadrant I, we need to consider only the points in Quadrant I.

However, the problem states that the region \\(\\mathcal{R}\\) is obtained by removing the points within the taxicab distance \\(\\frac{3}{5}\\) from any vertex, which implies that the overlapping volumes are already accounted for in the given problem setup.\n\n### Step 8: Calculating the Volume of \\(\\mathcal{R}\\)\nThe volume of the unit cube is 1. The volume of the region \\(\\mathcal{R}\\) is the volume of the unit cube minus the total volume of the taxicab spheres:\n\\[\n\\text{Volume of } \\mathcal{R} = 1 - \\frac{432}{125} = \\frac{125}{125} - \\frac{432}{125} = \\frac{125 - 432}{125} = \\frac{-307}{125}\n\\]\n\nHowever, this result is incorrect because the volume cannot be negative.

Compute the probability that no three faces of the same color share a common vertex.", "generated_responses": ["To solve the problem, we need to determine the probability that no three faces of the same color share a common vertex in a cube where each face is colored red or blue with equal probability.\n\n### Step 1: Total Number of Colorings\nEach face of the cube can be either red or blue. Since there are 6 faces, the total number of possible colorings is:\n\\[\n2^6 = 64\n\\]\n\n### Step 2: Counting Valid Colorings\nWe need to count the number of colorings where no three faces of the same color share a common vertex. Let's analyze the structure of the cube and the constraints.\n\n#### Constraint Analysis\n- A cube has 8 vertices.\n- Each vertex is shared by 3 faces.\n- We need to ensure that no vertex is shared by 3 faces of the same color.\n\n### Step 3: Valid Colorings\nWe will use a combinatorial approach to count the valid colorings. Consider the following cases:\n\n#### Case 1: All faces are the same color\n- If all 6 faces are red, then all vertices are shared by 3 red faces.\n- If all 6 faces are blue, then all vertices are shared by 3 blue faces.\n- Both of these cases are invalid.\n\n#### Case 2: 5 faces of one color and 1 face of the other color\n- If 5 faces are red and 1 face is blue, the blue face must be adjacent to 3 red faces, which means the blue face shares a vertex with 3 red faces.\n- Similarly, if 5 faces are blue and 1 face is red, the red face must be adjacent to 3 blue faces, which means the red face shares a vertex with 3 blue faces.\n- Both of these cases are invalid.\n\n#### Case 3: 4 faces of one color and 2 faces of the other color\n- If 4 faces are red and 2 faces are blue, we need to ensure that no vertex is shared by 3 red faces.\n- The 2 blue faces must be placed such that they do not share a vertex with 3 red faces.\n- There are 3 possible ways to place the 2 blue faces such that no vertex is shared by 3 red faces:\n  1. The blue faces are opposite each other.\n  2. The blue faces are adjacent and not sharing a vertex with 3 red faces.\n  3. The blue faces are adjacent and sharing a vertex with 2 red faces.\n\n- For each of these 3 configurations, the 4 red faces can be placed in the remaining 4 positions in only 1 way.\n- Therefore, there are \\(3\\) valid configurations for 4 red and 2 blue faces.\n- Similarly, there are \\(3\\) valid configurations for 4 blue and 2 red faces.\n\n#### Case 4: 3 faces of one color and 3 faces of the other color\n- If 3 faces are red and 3 faces are blue, we need to ensure that no vertex is shared by 3 red faces or 3 blue faces.\n- The only way to place 3 red and 3 blue faces such that no vertex is shared by 3 faces of the same color is to place them in a checkerboard pattern.\n- There are 2 possible checkerboard patterns (one starting with red and one starting with blue).\n\n### Step 4: Total Valid Colorings\n- From Case 3, we have \\(3 + 3 = 6\\) valid configurations.\n- From Case 4, we have \\(2\\) valid configurations.\n- Therefore, the total number of valid colorings is:\n\\[\n6 + 2 = 8\n\\]\n\n### Step 5: Probability Calculation\nThe probability that no three faces of the same color share a common vertex is the ratio of the number of valid colorings to the total number of colorings:\n\\[\n\\frac{8}{64} = \\frac{1}{8}\n\\]\n\nThus, the final answer is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{\\frac{1}{8}}\n\\]"], "id": 2978, "generated_answers": ["\\frac{1}{8}"], "gold_answer": "$\\frac{9}{32}$", "is_correct": false, "answers_correctness": [false]}

We need to extend three of its sides to form a triangle such that none of the vertices of the triangle lie on the 16-gon itself.\n\n### Step 2: Identifying the Possible Extensions\nEach side of the 16-gon can be extended in two directions. Therefore, for each side, there are two possible extensions. However, we need to choose three sides and their extensions to form a triangle.\n\n### Step 3: Counting the Total Number of Extensions\nSince there are 16 sides, and each side can be extended in 2 ways, the total number of ways to choose 3 sides and their extensions is:\n\\[\n\\binom{16}{3} \\times 2^3 = \\binom{16}{3} \\times 8\n\\]\n\n### Step 4: Calculating \\(\\binom{16}{3}\\)\n\\[\n\\binom{16}{3} = \\frac{16 \\times 15 \\times 14}{3 \\times 2 \\times 1} = 560\n\\]\n\n### Step 5: Total Number of Extensions\n\\[\n560 \\times 8 = 4480\n\\]\n\n### Step 6: Considering Congruence\nWe need to determine how many of these triangles are congruent. In a regular 16-gon, the triangles formed by extending sides are symmetric and can be rotated or reflected to form congruent triangles.\n\n### Step 7: Counting Noncongruent Triangles\nTo find the number of noncongruent triangles, we need to consider the rotational and reflectional symmetries of the 16-gon. The 16-gon has 16 rotational symmetries (0°, 22.5°, 45°, ..., 337.5°) and 16 reflectional symmetries, making a total of 32 symmetries.\n\n### Step 8: Using Burnside's Lemma\nBurnside's Lemma helps us count the number of distinct objects under group actions. We need to count the number of triangles fixed by each symmetry and then average these counts.\n\n### Step 9: Fixed Triangles by Rotations\n- **0° rotation**: All 4480 triangles are fixed.\n- **22.5°, 45°, ..., 337.5° rotations**: No triangle is fixed because the vertices of the triangle would not align with the vertices of the 16-gon.\n\n### Step 10: Fixed Triangles by Reflections\n- **Reflections**: Each reflection fixes a triangle if the triangle is symmetric with respect to the axis of reflection. There are 8 such reflections that fix a triangle.\n\n### Step 11: Applying Burnside's Lemma\n\\[\n\\text{Number of noncongruent triangles} = \\frac{1}{32} \\left( 4480 + 0 + 0 + \\cdots + 0 + 8 \\times 8 \\right) = \\frac{1}{32} \\left( 4480 + 64 \\right) = \\frac{4544}{32} = 142\n\\]\n\n### Final Answer\n\\[\n\\boxed{142}\n\\]"], "id": 3086, "generated_answers": ["142"], "gold_answer": "11", "is_correct": false, "answers_correctness": [false]}
