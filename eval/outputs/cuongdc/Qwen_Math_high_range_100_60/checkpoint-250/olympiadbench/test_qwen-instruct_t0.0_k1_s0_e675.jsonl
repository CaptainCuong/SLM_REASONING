Therefore, \\( \\ell(C) \\) is finite.\n\n### Step 3: Determining the Average Number of Steps\nTo find the average number of steps over all possible initial configurations, we need to consider the symmetry and the nature of the process.\n\n#### Symmetry Argument\n1. **Symmetry**: The process is symmetric with respect to heads and tails. This means that the number of steps to reach all tails from a configuration \\( C \\) is the same as the number of steps to reach all heads from the complement of \\( C \\) (where heads and tails are swapped).\n2. **Complement Configuration**: If \\( C \\) has \\( k \\) heads, its complement has \\( n - k \\) heads. The number of steps to reach all tails from \\( C \\) is the same as the number of steps to reach all heads from the complement of \\( C \\).\n\n#### Average Number of Steps\n1. **Total Number of Configurations**: There are \\( 2^n \\) possible initial configurations.\n2. **Sum of Steps**: Let \\( S \\) be the sum of the number of steps over all \\( 2^n \\) configurations. We need to find \\( S \\).\n\nUsing the symmetry argument, we can pair each configuration \\( C \\) with its complement. For each pair, the total number of steps is the same. Therefore, the average number of steps is the same for all pairs.\n\n3. **Average Calculation**:\n   - Each configuration \\( C \\) with \\( k \\) heads will take \\( k \\) steps to reach a state with \\( k-1 \\) heads.\n   - The total number of steps for all configurations can be calculated by summing the steps for each \\( k \\) from 1 to \\( n \\).\n\nThe average number of steps is given by:\n\\[\n\\text{Average} = \\frac{1}{2^n} \\sum_{C} \\ell(C)\n\\]\n\nSince each configuration \\( C \\) with \\( k \\) heads takes \\( k \\) steps, and there are \\( \\binom{n}{k} \\) such configurations, the total sum \\( S \\) is:\n\\[\nS = \\sum_{k=1}^{n} k \\binom{n}{k}\n\\]\n\nUsing the identity \\( k \\binom{n}{k} = n \\binom{n-1}{k-1} \\), we get:\n\\[\nS = n \\sum_{k=1}^{n} \\binom{n-1}{k-1} = n \\sum_{j=0}^{n-1} \\binom{n-1}{j} = n \\cdot 2^{n-1}\n\\]\n\nThus, the average number of steps is:\n\\[\n\\text{Average} = \\frac{S}{2^n} = \\frac{n \\cdot 2^{n-1}}{2^n} = \\frac{n}{2}\n\\]\n\n### Final Answer\n\\[\n\\boxed{\\frac{n}{2}}\n\\]"], "id": 1914, "generated_answers": ["\\frac{n}{2}"], "gold_answer": "$\\frac{1}{4} n(n+1)$", "is_correct": false, "answers_correctness": [false]}

We need to define a rule to determine a winner based on the relative order of the 200 cards. The rule must satisfy the following conditions:\n1.

If \\( A \\) beats \\( B \\) and \\( B \\) beats \\( C \\), then \\( A \\) beats \\( C \\).\n\n### Step 2: Analyzing the Conditions\nCondition 1 implies that the rule should be based on the order of the 200 cards, not on the specific values of the numbers on the cards.\n\nCondition 2 implies that if all elements of \\( A \\) are greater than the corresponding elements of \\( B \\), then \\( A \\) should be the winner.\n\nCondition 3 implies that the rule should be transitive. If \\( A \\) beats \\( B \\) and \\( B \\) beats \\( C \\), then \\( A \\) must beat \\( C \\).\n\n### Step 3: Identifying the Possible Rules\nGiven the conditions, the only rule that satisfies all these conditions is the lexicographic order. In lexicographic order, we compare the sets \\( A \\) and \\( B \\) by comparing their elements in increasing order. Specifically, we compare \\( a_1 \\) and \\( b_1 \\). If \\( a_1 > b_1 \\), then \\( A \\) beats \\( B \\). If \\( a_1 = b_1 \\), we compare \\( a_2 \\) and \\( b_2 \\), and so on.\n\n### Step 4: Verifying the Lexicographic Order\n- **Condition 1**: The lexicographic order depends only on the relative order of the 200 cards.\n- **Condition 2**: If \\( a_i > b_i \\) for all \\( i \\), then \\( A \\) beats \\( B \\) by definition of lexicographic order.\n- **Condition 3**: The lexicographic order is transitive. If \\( A \\) beats \\( B \\) and \\( B \\) beats \\( C \\), then \\( A \\) must beat \\( C \\).\n\n### Step 5: Conclusion\nSince the lexicographic order is the only rule that satisfies all the given conditions, there is exactly one way to define such a rule.\n\nThus, the number of ways to define such a rule is \\(\\boxed{1}\\)."], "id": 1977, "generated_answers": ["1"], "gold_answer": "100", "is_correct": true, "answers_correctness": [true]}

{"question": "A multiplicative partition of a positive integer $n \\geq 2$ is a way of writing $n$ as a product of one or more integers, each greater than 1.

This is given by the factorial of 25:\n\\[\n25!\n\\]\n\n### Step 2: Arrangements where Charlie is not next to Chris or Abby\nNext, we need to count the number of arrangements where Charlie is not next to either Chris or Abby. We will use the principle of inclusion-exclusion to do this.\n\n#### Step 2.1: Arrangements where Charlie is not next to Chris\nConsider the positions of Charlie and Chris. If Charlie is not next to Chris, we can treat Charlie and Chris as two separate entities. We can place Charlie in any of the 25 positions, and then Chris can be placed in any of the remaining 23 positions (since Chris cannot be next to Charlie). The remaining 23 people can be arranged in the remaining 23 positions in \\(23!\\) ways. Therefore, the number of arrangements where Charlie is not next to Chris is:\n\\[\n25 \\times 23 \\times 23!\n\\]\n\n#### Step 2.2: Arrangements where Charlie is not next to Abby\nSimilarly, the number of arrangements where Charlie is not next to Abby is:\n\\[\n25 \\times 23 \\times 23!\n\\]\n\n#### Step 2.3: Arrangements where Charlie is not next to both Chris and Abby\nNow, we need to count the number of arrangements where Charlie is not next to either Chris or Abby. We can place Charlie in any of the 25 positions, and then Chris and Abby can be placed in any of the remaining 23 positions such that neither is next to Charlie. The remaining 23 people can be arranged in the remaining 23 positions in \\(23!\\) ways. Therefore, the number of arrangements where Charlie is not next to both Chris and Abby is:\n\\[\n25 \\times 21 \\times 23!\n\\]\n\n### Step 3: Using the principle of inclusion-exclusion\nUsing the principle of inclusion-exclusion, the number of arrangements where Charlie is not next to either Chris or Abby is:\n\\[\n25 \\times 23 \\times 23! + 25 \\times 23 \\times 23! - 25 \\times 21 \\times 23!\n\\]\nSimplifying this expression:\n\\[\n25 \\times 23 \\times 23! + 25 \\times 23 \\times 23! - 25 \\times 21 \\times 23! = 25 \\times 23 \\times 23! \\times (1 + 1 - 0.913) = 25 \\times 23 \\times 23! \\times 1.087\n\\]\n\n### Step 4: Probability that Charlie is not next to Chris or Abby\nThe probability that Charlie is not next to Chris or Abby is the number of such arrangements divided by the total number of arrangements:\n\\[\n\\frac{25 \\times 23 \\times 23!

However, eighteen families arrive and are looking to move in. After much debate, the connotations of using negative house numbers are deemed unacceptable, and the city decides on an alternative plan. On July 17, Shewad Movers arrive and relocate every family from house $n$ to house $n+18$, for all positive $n$ (so that City Hall does not move). For example, the family in house number 17 moves to house number 35.\nRoss takes a walk starting at his house, which is number 34 . He first visits house $n_{1}$, such that $d\\left(n_{1}, 34\\right)=1 / 3$. He then goes to another house, $n_{2}$, such that $d\\left(n_{1}, n_{2}\\right)=1 / 3$. Continuing in that way, he visits houses $n_{3}, n_{4}, \\ldots$, and each time, $d\\left(n_{i}, n_{i+1}\\right)=1 / 3$.

{"question": "In ARMLopolis, every house number is a positive integer, and City Hall's address is 0. However, due to the curved nature of the cowpaths that eventually became the streets of ARMLopolis, the distance $d(n)$ between house $n$ and City Hall is not simply the value of $n$. Instead, if $n=3^{k} n^{\\prime}$, where $k \\geq 0$ is an integer and $n^{\\prime}$ is an integer not divisible by 3 , then $d(n)=3^{-k}$. For example, $d(18)=1 / 9$ and $d(17)=1$. Notice that even though no houses have negative numbers, $d(n)$ is well-defined for negative values of $n$. For example, $d(-33)=1 / 3$ because $-33=3^{1} \\cdot-11$. By definition, $d(0)=0$. Following the dictum \"location, location, location,\" this Power Question will refer to \"houses\" and \"house numbers\" interchangeably.\n\nCuriously, the arrangement of the houses is such that the distance from house $n$ to house $m$, written $d(m, n)$, is simply $d(m-n)$.

The number of ways to choose 3 distinct digits from 10 is given by the combination formula \\( \\binom{10}{3} \\).\n\n\\[\n\\binom{10}{3} = \\frac{10!}{3!(10-3)!} = \\frac{10 \\times 9 \\times 8}{3 \\times 2 \\times 1} = 120\n\\]\n\n### Step 3: Combine the choices\nSince the choices for the first three digits and the last three digits are independent, the total number of sort-of-decreasing six-digit natural numbers is the product of the number of ways to choose and arrange the first three digits and the number of ways to choose and arrange the last three digits.\n\n\\[\n84 \\times 120 = 10080\n\\]\n\nThus, the number of sort-of-decreasing six-digit natural numbers is \\(\\boxed{10080}\\)."], "id": 2762, "generated_answers": ["10080"], "gold_answer": "14400", "is_correct": false, "answers_correctness": [false]}

We need to determine which of these integers is the mean, median, and mode.\n\n### Step 1: Determine the Mode\nThe mode is the most frequently occurring number in the list. Since the mode is unique, it must appear more frequently than any other number in the list.\n\n### Step 2: Determine the Median\nThe median is the middle number when the list is sorted. If the list has an odd number of elements, the median is the middle element. If the list has an even number of elements, the median is the average of the two middle elements.\n\n### Step 3: Determine the Mean\nThe mean is the sum of the elements divided by the number of elements.\n\n### Step 4: Consider Different Cases\nWe will consider different cases for the positions of \\( n-1 \\), \\( n \\), and \\( n+1 \\) in the list.\n\n#### Case 1: \\( n-1 \\) is the mode\nIf \\( n-1 \\) is the mode, it must appear more frequently than any other number.

Let's try a list with 6 elements:\n- List: \\( 1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 3 \\)\n- Mode: \\( 1 \\)\n- Median: \\( \\frac{2+2}{2} = 2 \\)\n- Mean: \\( \\frac{1+1+2+2+3+3}{6} = 2 \\)\n\nThis list works.

The coordinates of the vertices can be expressed in terms of the side length and the orientation of the square.\n\n5. **Consider the possible orientations:**\n   The square can be oriented in two ways: with sides parallel to the coordinate axes or with sides at a 45-degree angle to the coordinate axes.\n\n6. **Case 1: Sides parallel to the coordinate axes:**\n   If the sides are parallel to the coordinate axes, the coordinates of the vertices can be:\n   \\[\n   A = (11, 5), \\quad B = (11 + 5\\sqrt{26}, 5), \\quad C = (11 + 5\\sqrt{26}, 5 + 5\\sqrt{26}), \\quad D = (11, 5 + 5\\sqrt{26})\n   \\]\n   The midpoints are:\n   \\[\n   R = \\left(11 + \\frac{5\\sqrt{26}}{2}, 5\\right), \\quad M = \\left(11 + 5\\sqrt{26}, 5 + \\frac{5\\sqrt{26}}{2}\\right), \\quad L = \\left(11 + \\frac{5\\sqrt{26}}{2}, 5 + 5\\sqrt{26}\\right)\n   \\]\n   Since \\( R \\) must be in Quadrant I and a lattice point, \\( \\frac{5\\sqrt{26}}{2} \\) must be an integer. However, \\( \\sqrt{26} \\) is not a rational number, so this case is not possible.\n\n7. **Case 2: Sides at a 45-degree angle:**\n   If the sides are at a 45-degree angle, the coordinates of the vertices can be:\n   \\[\n   A = (11, 5), \\quad B = (11 + 5\\sqrt{26} \\cos 45^\\circ, 5 + 5\\sqrt{26} \\sin 45^\\circ), \\quad C = (11 + 5\\sqrt{26} \\cos 135^\\circ, 5 + 5\\sqrt{26} \\sin 135^\\circ), \\quad D = (11 + 5\\sqrt{26} \\cos 225^\\circ, 5 + 5\\sqrt{26} \\sin 225^\\circ)\n   \\]\n   Simplifying, we get:\n   \\[\n   A = (11, 5), \\quad B = (11 + 5\\sqrt{13}, 5 + 5\\sqrt{13}), \\quad C = (11 - 5\\sqrt{13}, 5 + 5\\sqrt{13}), \\quad D = (11 - 5\\sqrt{13}, 5 - 5\\sqrt{13})\n   \\]\n   The midpoints are:\n   \\[\n   R = \\left(11 + \\frac{5\\sqrt{13}}{2}, 5 + \\frac{5\\sqrt{13}}{2}\\right), \\quad M = \\left(11, 5 + 5\\sqrt{13}\\right), \\quad L = \\left(11 - \\frac{5\\sqrt{13}}{2}, 5 + \\frac{5\\sqrt{13}}{2}\\right)\n   \\]\n   Since \\( R \\) must be in Quadrant I and a lattice point, \\( \\frac{5\\sqrt{13}}{2} \\) must be an integer.

Compute the probability that no three faces of the same color share a common vertex.", "generated_responses": ["To solve this problem, we need to determine the probability that no three faces of the same color share a common vertex on a cube where each face is colored red or blue with equal probability.\n\n### Step 1: Total Number of Colorings\nEach of the six faces of the cube can be colored either red or blue. Therefore, the total number of possible colorings is:\n\\[\n2^6 = 64\n\\]\n\n### Step 2: Identify the Condition\nWe need to count the number of colorings where no three faces of the same color share a common vertex. Let's analyze the structure of the cube and the possible colorings.\n\n### Step 3: Analyze the Cube's Structure\nA cube has 8 vertices, and each vertex is shared by 3 faces. We need to ensure that no vertex is shared by three faces of the same color.\n\n### Step 4: Count Valid Colorings\nWe will use a combinatorial approach to count the valid colorings. Consider the following cases:\n\n#### Case 1: All faces are the same color\nIf all six faces are the same color, then all three faces meeting at any vertex will be the same color. This is not allowed. Therefore, there are 0 valid colorings in this case.\n\n#### Case 2: Five faces are the same color\nIf five faces are the same color, the sixth face must be the opposite color. However, this will always result in at least one vertex where three faces of the same color meet. Therefore, there are 0 valid colorings in this case.\n\n#### Case 3: Four faces are the same color\nIf four faces are the same color, the remaining two faces must be the opposite color. We need to check if this configuration can avoid having three faces of the same color meeting at any vertex. There are two sub-cases:\n- The four same-colored faces form a tetrahedron (no three faces meet at any vertex).\n- The four same-colored faces do not form a tetrahedron (at least one vertex has three same-colored faces).\n\nThe only valid configuration is when the four same-colored faces form a tetrahedron. There are 2 such configurations (one for each color). Therefore, there are 2 valid colorings in this case.\n\n#### Case 4: Three faces are the same color\nIf three faces are the same color, the remaining three faces must be the opposite color. We need to check if this configuration can avoid having three faces of the same color meeting at any vertex. There are two sub-cases:\n- The three same-colored faces form a triangle (no three faces meet at any vertex).\n- The three same-colored faces do not form a triangle (at least one vertex has three same-colored faces).\n\nThe only valid configuration is when the three same-colored faces form a triangle. There are 8 such configurations (one for each vertex). Therefore, there are 8 valid colorings in this case.\n\n#### Case 5: Two faces are the same color\nIf two faces are the same color, the remaining four faces must be the opposite color. We need to check if this configuration can avoid having three faces of the same color meeting at any vertex. There are two sub-cases:\n- The two same-colored faces are opposite each other (no three faces meet at any vertex).\n- The two same-colored faces are adjacent (at least one vertex has three same-colored faces).\n\nThe only valid configuration is when the two same-colored faces are opposite each other. There are 3 such configurations (one for each pair of opposite faces). Therefore, there are 3 valid colorings in this case.\n\n#### Case 6: One face is the same color\nIf one face is the same color, the remaining five faces must be the opposite color. This configuration will always result in at least one vertex where three faces of the same color meet.
