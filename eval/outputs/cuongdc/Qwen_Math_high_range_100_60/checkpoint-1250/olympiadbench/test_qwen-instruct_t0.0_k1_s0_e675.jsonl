For example, the number 5 in binary is \\(101_2\\), so its weight is 2.\n\n### Step 2: Counting Numbers with Even and Odd Weights\nWe need to count the number of positive integers up to \\(2^{2017}\\) that have an even weight and those that have an odd weight.\n\n### Step 3: Total Number of Positive Integers\nThe total number of positive integers up to \\(2^{2017}\\) is \\(2^{2017} - 1\\).\n\n### Step 4: Symmetry in Binary Representation\nConsider the binary representation of numbers from 0 to \\(2^{2017} - 1\\).

Since 2017 is an odd number, the number of 1s in a 2017-bit binary string can be even or odd with equal probability.\n\n### Step 6: Counting Even and Odd Weight Numbers\nSince the total number of 2017-bit binary strings is \\(2^{2017}\\), and half of them will have an even number of 1s and half will have an odd number of 1s, we have:\n- Number of 2017-bit binary strings with even weight: \\(\\frac{2^{2017}}{2} = 2^{2016}\\)\n- Number of 2017-bit binary strings with odd weight: \\(\\frac{2^{2017}}{2} = 2^{2016}\\)\n\n### Step 7: Adjusting for Positive Integers\nThe number of positive integers up to \\(2^{2017}\\) is \\(2^{2017} - 1\\).

The smallest possible pairs are:\n- \\( 1 + 14 = 15 \\)\n- \\( 2 + 13 = 15 \\)\n- \\( 3 + 12 = 15 \\)\n- \\( 4 + 11 = 15 \\)\n- \\( 5 + 10 = 15 \\)\n- \\( 6 + 9 = 15 \\)\n- \\( 7 + 8 = 15 \\)\n\n### Step 4: Generalizing the Pairs\nFor any \\( n \\geq 15 \\), the pairs that sum to \\( n \\) can be written as:\n- \\( 1 + (n-1) \\)\n- \\( 2 + (n-2) \\)\n- \\( 3 + (n-3) \\)\n- \\(\\ldots\\)\n- \\( \\left\\lfloor \\frac{n}{2} \\right\\rfloor + \\left\\lceil \\frac{n}{2} \\right\\rceil \\)\n\n### Step 5: Partitioning the Set of Positive Integers\nTo ensure that every \\( n \\geq 15 \\) can be formed by pairs in at least one subset \\( A_i \\), we need to distribute the elements of the set of positive integers into \\( k \\) subsets such that each subset can form pairs summing to any \\( n \\geq 15 \\).\n\n### Step 6: Determining the Maximum \\( k \\)\nThe key insight is that each subset \\( A_i \\) must be able to form pairs summing to any \\( n \\geq 15 \\). The smallest elements in each subset must be distinct and cover all possible pairs. The maximum number of such distinct subsets is determined by the number of distinct pairs that can be formed.\n\n### Step 7: Conclusion\nGiven the constraints and the need to form pairs for all \\( n \\geq 15 \\), the maximum number of subsets \\( k \\) that can satisfy the condition is 8. This is because we can partition the set of positive integers into 8 subsets, each containing elements that can form pairs summing to any \\( n \\geq 15 \\).\n\nThus, the greatest positive integer \\( k \\) that satisfies the given property is \\(\\boxed{8}\\)."], "id": 1694, "generated_answers": ["8"], "gold_answer": "3", "is_correct": false, "answers_correctness": [false]}

In other words, no two kings can be placed in adjacent squares (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally).\n2. **Each Row and Column Contains Exactly 25 Kings**: This means we need to place 25 kings in each row and each column.\n\n### Step 2: Placing Kings in a Row\nConsider a single row of 100 squares. We need to place 25 kings in this row such that no two kings are adjacent. One way to achieve this is to place the kings in every fourth square. For example, we can place kings in squares 1, 5, 9, ..., 97. This pattern ensures that no two kings are adjacent.\n\n### Step 3: Extending to the Entire Board\nWe need to extend this pattern to all 100 rows. We can use a similar pattern for each row, but we need to ensure that the pattern is consistent across all rows and columns.\n\n### Step 4: Ensuring Consistency Across Columns\nTo ensure that each column also contains exactly 25 kings, we can use a checkerboard pattern. Specifically, we can place kings in the squares of one color in a checkerboard pattern. For example, we can place kings in all the black squares of a checkerboard pattern.\n\n### Step 5: Verifying the Solution\n- **No Two Kings Are Adjacent**: In a checkerboard pattern, no two black squares (or white squares) are adjacent. Therefore, no two kings can capture each other.\n- **Each Row and Column Contains Exactly 25 Kings**: In a \\(100 \\times 100\\) checkerboard, there are 50 black squares and 50 white squares in each row and each column. By placing kings in all the black squares, we ensure that each row and each column contains exactly 25 kings.\n\n### Step 6: Counting the Number of Arrangements\nSince the problem specifies that two arrangements differing by rotation or symmetry are considered different, we need to consider all possible checkerboard patterns. There are two possible checkerboard patterns: one starting with a black square in the top-left corner and one starting with a white square in the top-left corner.\n\nThus, there are exactly 2 such arrangements.\n\n### Final Answer\n\\[\n\\boxed{2}\n\\]"], "id": 1724, "generated_answers": ["2"], "gold_answer": "2", "is_correct": true, "answers_correctness": [true]}

There are only zeros on the blackboard.\n- Player \\( A \\) wants to maximize the number of cookies received.\n- Player \\( B \\) wants to minimize the number of cookies given to player \\( A \\).\n\n### Analysis\n1. **Initial Sum of Numbers:**\n   - The initial sum of all numbers on the blackboard is \\( 2020 \\times 1 = 2020 \\).\n\n2. **Possible Moves:**\n   - When player \\( A \\) erases two numbers \\( x \\) and \\( y \\), the sum of the numbers on the blackboard decreases by \\( x + y \\).\n   - Player \\( B \\) can choose to write either \\( x + y \\) or \\( |x - y| \\).\n\n3. **Strategy for Player \\( B \\):**\n   - To minimize the number of cookies, player \\( B \\) should try to keep the numbers on the blackboard as small as possible.\n   - Writing \\( |x - y| \\) is generally smaller than \\( x + y \\) unless \\( x \\) and \\( y \\) are very close in value.\n\n4. **Game Termination:**\n   - The game will terminate when the sum of the numbers on the blackboard is less than or equal to the largest number on the blackboard.\n   - This is because if the largest number is greater than the sum of all other numbers, the game ends.\n\n### Optimal Play\n- Player \\( A \\) will try to maximize the number of rounds before the game terminates.\n- Player \\( B \\) will try to minimize the number of rounds by keeping the numbers small.\n\n### Key Insight\n- The game will end when the sum of the numbers on the blackboard is less than or equal to the largest number.\n- The sum of the numbers on the blackboard decreases by \\( x + y \\) each round.\n- The largest number on the blackboard will be at most the sum of the numbers on the blackboard.\n\n### Calculation\n- Let's denote the number of rounds by \\( n \\).\n- After \\( n \\) rounds, the sum of the numbers on the blackboard is \\( 2020 - n \\).\n- The game terminates when \\( 2020 - n \\leq 1 \\), which implies \\( n \\geq 2019 \\).\n\n### Conclusion\n- The game will terminate after 2019 rounds.\n- At the end of the game, there will be only one number left on the blackboard, which is 1.\n- Therefore, player \\( B \\) will give 1 cookie to player \\( A \\).\n\nThus, the number of cookies that player \\( A \\) receives is \\(\\boxed{1}\\)."], "id": 1887, "generated_answers": ["1"], "gold_answer": "7", "is_correct": false, "answers_correctness": [false]}
{"question": "Let $n$ be a positive integer. Harry has $n$ coins lined up on his desk, each showing heads or tails. He repeatedly does the following operation: if there are $k$ coins showing heads and $k>0$, then he flips the $k^{\\text {th }}$ coin over; otherwise he stops the process. (For example, the process starting with THT would be THT $\\rightarrow H H T \\rightarrow H T T \\rightarrow T T T$, which takes three steps.)\n\nLetting $C$ denote the initial configuration (a sequence of $n H$ 's and $T$ 's), write $\\ell(C)$ for the number of steps needed before all coins show $T$. Show that this number $\\ell(C)$ is finite, and determine its average value over all $2^{n}$ possible initial configurations $C$.", "generated_responses": ["To solve the problem, we need to analyze the process of flipping coins and determine the number of steps required to reach a state where all coins show tails. We will also find the average number of steps over all possible initial configurations.\n\n### Step 1: Understanding the Process\n1. **Initial Configuration**: We start with a sequence of \\( n \\) coins, each showing either heads (H) or tails (T).\n2. **Operation**: If there are \\( k \\) coins showing heads and \\( k > 0 \\), the \\( k \\)-th coin is flipped. If \\( k = 0 \\), the process stops.\n\n### Step 2: Finite Number of Steps\nTo show that the number of steps \\(\\ell(C)\\) is finite, we need to observe that each flip changes the number of heads by exactly 1 (either increasing or decreasing it by 1). Since the number of heads can range from 0 to \\( n \\), and the process stops when the number of heads is 0, the number of steps is at most \\( n \\). Therefore, \\(\\ell(C)\\) is finite.\n\n### Step 3: Determining the Average Number of Steps\nTo find the average number of steps over all possible initial configurations, we need to consider the symmetry and the expected value of the number of steps.\n\n#### Symmetry Argument\n1. **Symmetry**: The process is symmetric with respect to the number of heads and tails. This means that the expected number of steps to reach all tails from any configuration with \\( k \\) heads is the same as the expected number of steps to reach all heads from any configuration with \\( k \\) tails.\n2. **Expected Value Calculation**: Let \\( E(k) \\) be the expected number of steps to reach all tails starting from a configuration with \\( k \\) heads. We need to find \\( E(k) \\) for \\( k = 0, 1, 2, \\ldots, n \\).\n\n#### Recurrence Relation\n1. **Base Case**: \\( E(0) = 0 \\) (no steps needed if all coins are tails).\n2. **Recurrence Relation**: For \\( k > 0 \\), the expected number of steps \\( E(k) \\) can be expressed as:\n   \\[\n   E(k) = 1 + \\frac{1}{2} E(k-1) + \\frac{1}{2} E(k+1)\n   \\]\n   This is because with probability \\( \\frac{1}{2} \\), the \\( k \\)-th coin is heads and it will be flipped to tails, reducing the number of heads to \\( k-1 \\). With probability \\( \\frac{1}{2} \\), the \\( k \\)-th coin is tails and it will be flipped to heads, increasing the number of heads to \\( k+1 \\).\n\n#### Solving the Recurrence\n1. **Simplifying the Recurrence**: Rearrange the recurrence relation:\n   \\[\n   E(k+1) - 2E(k) + E(k-1) = -2\n   \\]\n2. **General Solution**: The general solution to this recurrence relation is:\n   \\[\n   E(k) = k(n-k)\n   \\]\n   This can be verified by substituting \\( E(k) = k(n-k) \\) into the recurrence relation and checking that it satisfies the equation.\n\n#### Average Number of Steps\n1. **Total Number of Configurations**: There are \\( 2^n \\) possible initial configurations.\n2. **Sum of Expected Values**: The total expected number of steps over all configurations is:\n   \\[\n   \\sum_{k=0}^{n} \\binom{n}{k} E(k) = \\sum_{k=0}^{n} \\binom{n}{k} k(n-k)\n   \\]\n3. **Simplifying the Sum**: Using the binomial theorem and properties of binomial coefficients:\n   \\[\n   \\sum_{k=0}^{n} \\binom{n}{k} k(n-k) = n(n-1) \\sum_{k=0}^{n} \\binom{n-2}{k-1} = n(n-1) 2^{n-2}\n   \\]\n4. **Average Number of Steps**: The average number of steps is:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{n(n-1) 2^{n-2}}{2^n} = \\frac{n(n-1)}{4}\n   \\]\n\nThus, the average number of steps needed before all coins show tails is \\(\\boxed{\\frac{n(n-1)}{4}}\\)."], "id": 1914, "generated_answers": ["\\frac{n(n-1)}{4}"], "gold_answer": "$\\frac{1}{4} n(n+1)$", "is_correct": false, "answers_correctness": [false]}

Any triangle inscribed in this circle will have its vertices on the circumference of the circle. The perimeter of such a triangle is the sum of the lengths of its three sides.\n\n### Step 2: Perimeter of an Inscribed Triangle\nFor an inscribed triangle, the perimeter \\( P \\) is given by:\n\\[ P = a + b + c \\]\nwhere \\( a, b, \\) and \\( c \\) are the lengths of the sides of the triangle.

A nonintersecting route of the limp rook consists of a sequence of pairwise different squares that the limp rook can visit in that order by an admissible sequence of moves.

The general term of the first column can be written as:\n\\[ T(R, 1) = 4 + (R-1) \\cdot 3 = 3R + 1 \\]\n\n### Step 4: Generalize the Formula for Any Row and Column\nTo find the general formula for \\( T(R, C) \\), we need to consider the structure of the table. Each row and each column is an arithmetic sequence, and the common difference between the terms in each row and each column is the same.\n\nThe general term for the \\( R \\)-th row can be written as:\n\\[ T(R, C) = T(1, C) + (R-1) \\cdot d_2 \\]\nwhere \\( d_2 \\) is the common difference between the terms in each row.\n\nSince the first term of the \\( R \\)-th row is \\( 3C + 1 \\) and the common difference between the rows is 3, we have:\n\\[ T(R, C) = 3C + 1 + (R-1) \\cdot 3 = 3C + 1 + 3R - 3 = 3R + 3C - 2 \\]\n\n### Step 5: Verify the Formula\nTo verify, let's check the first few terms:\n- For \\( R = 1 \\) and \\( C = 1 \\):\n  \\[ T(1, 1) = 3(1) + 3(1) - 2 = 4 \\]\n- For \\( R = 1 \\) and \\( C = 2 \\):\n  \\[ T(1, 2) = 3(1) + 3(2) - 2 = 7 \\]\n- For \\( R = 2 \\) and \\( C = 1 \\):\n  \\[ T(2, 1) = 3(2) + 3(1) - 2 = 7 \\]\n- For \\( R = 2 \\) and \\( C = 2 \\):\n  \\[ T(2, 2) = 3(2) + 3(2) - 2 = 10 \\]\n\nThese values match the given table, confirming that the formula is correct.\n\n### Final Answer\nThe formula for the number in the \\( R \\)-th row and \\( C \\)-th column is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{3R + 3C - 2}\n\\]"], "id": 2258, "generated_answers": ["3R + 3C - 2"], "gold_answer": "$2RC+R+C$", "is_correct": false, "answers_correctness": [false]}

The diagonals of a square are equal in length and bisect each other at right angles. The slopes of the diagonals of a square are negative reciprocals of each other.\n\n### Step 2: Determine the Slope of the Diagonals\nGiven that the slope of diagonal \\( WY \\) is 2, the slope of the other diagonal \\( XZ \\) must be the negative reciprocal of 2.

Let's assume \\( n+1 \\) appears \\( m \\) times, where \\( m \\geq 2 \\).\n\n#### Case 2: \\( n \\) is the Median\nSince \\( n \\) is the median, it must be the middle element when the list is sorted. This implies the list has an odd number of elements.\n\n#### Case 3: \\( n-1 \\) is the Mean\nThe mean is \\( n-1 \\), so the sum of the elements divided by \\( k \\) is \\( n-1 \\). Therefore, the sum of the elements is \\( (n-1)k \\).\n\n### Step 6: Construct the List\nTo minimize the sum, we need to use the smallest possible values for \\( n \\) and \\( k \\).\n\nLet's try \\(

{"question": "The six sides of convex hexagon $A_{1} A_{2} A_{3} A_{4} A_{5} A_{6}$ are colored red. Each of the diagonals of the hexagon is colored either red or blue. Compute the number of colorings such that every triangle $A_{i} A_{j} A_{k}$ has at least one red side.", "generated_responses": ["To solve the problem, we need to determine the number of ways to color the diagonals of a convex hexagon such that every triangle formed by the vertices of the hexagon has at least one red side. Let's break this down step by step.\n\n1. **Identify the triangles and diagonals:**\n   - A convex hexagon has 6 vertices: \\( A_1, A_2, A_3, A_4, A_5, A_6 \\).\n   - The number of triangles that can be formed by choosing 3 vertices from 6 is given by \\(\\binom{6}{3} = 20\\).\n   - The number of diagonals in a hexagon is given by \\(\\binom{6}{2} - 6 = 9\\).\n\n2. **Coloring constraints:**\n   - Each side of the hexagon is already colored red.\n   - Each diagonal can be colored either red or blue.\n   - We need to ensure that every triangle has at least one red side.\n\n3. **Analyze the triangles:**\n   - Each triangle \\( A_i A_j A_k \\) can have 0, 1, 2, or 3 red sides.\n   - We need to count the number of colorings such that no triangle has 0 red sides.\n\n4. **Count the total number of colorings without constraints:**\n   - Each of the 9 diagonals can be colored either red or blue.\n   - Therefore, the total number of colorings is \\( 2^9 = 512 \\).\n\n5. **Count the invalid colorings:**\n   - An invalid coloring is one where at least one triangle has no red sides.\n   - We will use the principle of inclusion-exclusion to count the number of invalid colorings.\n\n6. **Count the number of triangles with no red sides:**\n   - A triangle has no red sides if all its sides are diagonals and all are colored blue.\n   - There are 20 triangles in total.\n\n7. **Count the number of ways to color the diagonals such that a specific triangle has no red sides:**\n   - If a specific triangle has no red sides, the 3 diagonals of that triangle must be blue.\n   - The remaining 6 diagonals can be colored either red or blue.\n   - Therefore, the number of ways to color the diagonals such that a specific triangle has no red sides is \\( 2^6 = 64 \\).\n\n8. **Use inclusion-exclusion principle:**\n   - Let \\( A_i \\) be the set of colorings where the \\( i \\)-th triangle has no red sides.\n   - We need to find \\( |A_1 \\cup A_2 \\cup \\cdots \\cup A_{20}| \\).\n\n   Using the principle of inclusion-exclusion:\n   \\[\n   |A_1 \\cup A_2 \\cup \\cdots \\cup A_{20}| = \\sum_{i=1}^{20} |A_i| - \\sum_{1 \\le i < j \\le 20} |A_i \\cap A_j| + \\sum_{1 \\le i < j < k \\le 20} |A_i \\cap A_j \\cap A_k| - \\cdots\n   \\]\n\n   - \\( |A_i| = 64 \\) for each \\( i \\).\n   - \\( |A_i \\cap A_j| \\) is the number of ways to color the diagonals such that two specific triangles have no red sides. This is not possible since two triangles share at least one diagonal.\n   - Higher-order intersections are also not possible for the same reason.\n\n   Therefore, the number of invalid colorings is:\n   \\[\n   20 \\times 64 = 1280\n   \\]\n\n9. **Correct the overcounting:**\n   - Since the total number of colorings is 512, and we have overcounted, we need to re-evaluate the problem.\n\n10. **Re-evaluate the problem:**\n    - The correct approach is to use the fact that each triangle must have at least one red side.\n    - The number of valid colorings is the total number of colorings minus the number of invalid colorings.\n\n11. **Final calculation:**\n    - The number of valid colorings is:\n    \\[\n    512 - 1280 = 320\n    \\]\n\nThus, the number of valid colorings is \\(\\boxed{320}\\)."], "id": 2953, "generated_answers": ["320"], "gold_answer": "392", "is_correct": false, "answers_correctness": [false]}

The only way this can be valid is if \\(A = 25\\), because then:\n     \\[\n     |x + y| = 6(\\sqrt{25} - 5) = 6(5 - 5) = 6 \\cdot 0 = 0\n     \\]\n     This means \\(x + y = 0\\) or \\(x + y = 0\\).\n\n4. **Solve the system of equations:**\n   - The second equation is \\(x^2 + y^2 = B^2\\).\n     \\[\n     x^2 + y^2 = 2^2 = 4\n     \\]\n   - Since \\(x + y = 0\\), we can substitute \\(y = -x\\) into the second equation:\n     \\[\n     x^2 + (-x)^2 = 4 \\implies x^2 + x^2 = 4 \\implies 2x^2 = 4 \\implies x^2 = 2 \\implies x = \\pm \\sqrt{2}\n     \\]\n     Therefore, the solutions are:\n     \\[\n     (x, y) = (\\sqrt{2}, -\\sqrt{2}) \\quad \\text{and} \\quad (x, y) = (-\\sqrt{2}, \\sqrt{2})\n     \\]\n\n5. **Compute the sum of the absolute values:**\n   - For the pair \\((\\sqrt{2}, -\\sqrt{2})\\):\n     \\[\n     |x_1| + |y_1| = |\\sqrt{2}| + |-\\sqrt{2}| = \\sqrt{2} + \\sqrt{2} = 2\\sqrt{2}\n     \\]\n   - For the pair \\((- \\sqrt{2}, \\sqrt{2})\\):\n     \\[\n     |x_2| + |y_2| = |-\\sqrt{2}| + |\\sqrt{2}| = \\sqrt{2} + \\sqrt{2} = 2\\sqrt{2}\n     \\]\n   - Therefore, the total sum is:\n     \\[\n     |x_1| + |y_1| + |x_2| + |y_2| = 2\\sqrt{2} + 2\\sqrt{2} = 4\\sqrt{2}\n     \\]\n\nThe final answer is \\(\\boxed{4\\sqrt{2}}\\)."], "id": 2967, "generated_answers": ["4\\sqrt{2}"], "gold_answer": "24", "is_correct": false, "answers_correctness": [false]}

Since there are 6 faces, the total number of possible colorings is:\n\\[\n2^6 = 64\n\\]\n\n### Step 2: Counting Valid Colorings\nWe need to count the number of colorings where no three faces of the same color share a common vertex. Let's analyze the structure of the cube:\n\n- A cube has 8 vertices.\n- Each vertex is shared by 3 faces.\n\n### Step 3: Constraints on Colorings\nFor no three faces of the same color to share a common vertex, each vertex must have exactly 1 red and 2 blue faces, or 1 blue and 2 red faces. This ensures that no three faces of the same color meet at any vertex.\n\n### Step 4: Valid Colorings for Each Vertex\nConsider a single vertex.

Each valid coloring must ensure that the colorings at all vertices are consistent.

We know that \\( \\sin^2 x \\) ranges from 0 to 1, so \\( x \\) must be in the interval \\([0, \\frac{5\\pi}{2}]\\).\n\n### Step 2: Determine the relevant interval\nWe are interested in the first quadrant, so we consider \\( x \\) in the interval \\([0, \\frac{\\pi}{2}]\\).
