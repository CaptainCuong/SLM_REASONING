However, not all integers in this range are equally likely, and some products can be achieved in multiple ways.\n\n### Step 2: Prime Factorization of the Product\nThe product of the numbers rolled can be expressed as a product of prime factors. The prime factors of the numbers 1 through 6 are:\n- \\( 1 \\) has no prime factors.\n- \\( 2 \\) has the prime factor \\( 2 \\).\n- \\( 3 \\) has the prime factor \\( 3 \\).\n- \\( 4 \\) has the prime factors \\( 2^2 \\).\n- \\( 5 \\) has the prime factor \\( 5 \\).\n- \\( 6 \\) has the prime factors \\( 2 \\times 3 \\).\n\n### Step 3: Counting the Number of Different Products\nTo find the number of different products, we need to count the number of distinct combinations of the prime factors \\( 2, 3, \\) and \\( 5 \\) that can be formed by rolling \\( n \\) dice.\n\n### Step 4: Using the Principle of Inclusion-Exclusion\nThe number of different products is given by the number of distinct combinations of the exponents of the prime factors \\( 2, 3, \\) and \\( 5 \\) in the product. Each die can contribute 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5 to the exponent of 2, 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4 to the exponent of 3, and 0 or 1 to the exponent of 5.\n\n### Step 5: Calculating the Number of Different Products\nThe number of different products is the number of distinct combinations of the exponents of \\( 2, 3, \\) and \\( 5 \\):\n- The exponent of 2 can be any integer from 0 to \\( 5n \\) (since each die can contribute up to 5).\n- The exponent of 3 can be any integer from 0 to \\( 4n \\) (since each die can contribute up to 4).\n- The exponent of 5 can be any integer from 0 to \\( n \\) (since each die can contribute up to 1).\n\nThe total number of different products is:\n\\[\n(5n + 1)(4n + 1)(n + 1)\n\\]\n\n### Step 6: Setting Up the Equation\nWe are given that the number of different products is 936:\n\\[\n(5n + 1)(4n + 1)(n + 1) = 936\n\\]\n\n### Step 7: Solving the Equation\nWe need to find the integer value of \\( n \\) that satisfies this equation.
