This constraint will help us bound the values of \\( x_i \\).\n\n### Step 2: Analyzing the Sum \\( S \\)\nWe need to maximize the sum \\( S = \\sum_{i=1}^{100} x_i x_{i+2} \\). To do this, we will consider the structure of the sequence \\( x_1, x_2, \\ldots, x_{100} \\).\n\n### Step 3: Considering a Specific Sequence\nLet's consider a sequence where \\( x_i = \\frac{1}{2} \\) for all \\( i \\). This sequence satisfies the constraint \\( x_i + x_{i+1} + x_{i+2} = \\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{1}{2} = 1.5 \\leq 1 \\), which is not possible. Therefore, we need to find a sequence that satisfies the constraint and maximizes \\( S \\).\n\n### Step 4: Constructing a Valid Sequence\nConsider the sequence where \\( x_1 = x_3 = x_5 = \\cdots = x_{99} = \\frac{1}{2} \\) and \\( x_2 = x_4 = x_6 = \\cdots = x_{100} = 0 \\).

The goal is to find the smallest \\( n \\) for which this is possible.\n\n### Step 2: Initial Consideration\nFirst, let's consider the simplest case where \\( n = 1 \\). If \\( n = 1 \\), we would have:\n\n\\[\nx^2 + 7 = f_1(x)^2.\n\\]\n\nHowever, \\( x^2 + 7 \\) is not a perfect square of any polynomial with rational coefficients. Therefore, \\( n = 1 \\) is not possible.\n\n### Step 3: Considering \\( n = 2 \\)\nNext, let's consider \\( n = 2 \\). We need to find polynomials \\( f_1(x) \\) and \\( f_2(x) \\) such that:\n\n\\[\nx^2 + 7 = f_1(x)^2 + f_2(x)^2.\n\\]\n\nWe can try to find such polynomials. One possible approach is to use the identity for the sum of squares:\n\n\\[\na^2 + b^2 = (a + bi)(a - bi).\n\\]\n\nHowever, this approach does not directly help us find polynomials with rational coefficients. Instead, we can use a known result from number theory and algebra, which states that a polynomial of the form \\( x^2 + a \\) (where \\( a \\) is a positive integer) can be expressed as a sum of two squares of polynomials with rational coefficients if and only if \\( a \\) is a sum of two squares of integers.\n\n### Step 4: Checking if 7 is a Sum of Two Squares\nWe need to check if 7 can be expressed as a sum of two squares of integers. The possible pairs of integers are:\n\n\\[\n7 = 1^2 + 2^2.\n\\]\n\nThus, we can write:\n\n\\[\n7 = 1^2 + 2^2.\n\\]\n\n### Step 5: Constructing the Polynomials\nUsing the above result, we can construct the polynomials \\( f_1(x) \\) and \\( f_2(x) \\) as follows:\n\n\\[\nf_1(x) = x,\n\\]\n\\[\nf_2(x) = 2.\n\\]\n\nThen,\n\n\\[\nf_1(x)^2 + f_2(x)^2 = x^2 + 2^2 = x^2 + 4.\n\\]\n\nHowever, we need \\( x^2 + 7 \\). We can adjust the polynomials to:\n\n\\[\nf_1(x) = x,\n\\]\n\\[\nf_2(x) = \\sqrt{3}x.\n\\]\n\nThen,\n\n\\[\nf_1(x)^2 + f_2(x)^2 = x^2 + (\\sqrt{3}x)^2 = x^2 + 3x^2 = 4x^2.\n\\]\n\nThis does not work.

(For example, the process starting with THT would be THT $\\rightarrow H H T \\rightarrow H T T \\rightarrow T T T$, which takes three steps.)\n\nLetting $C$ denote the initial configuration (a sequence of $n H$ 's and $T$ 's), write $\\ell(C)$ for the number of steps needed before all coins show $T$. Show that this number $\\ell(C)$ is finite, and determine its average value over all $2^{n}$ possible initial configurations $C$.", "generated_responses": ["To solve the problem, we need to analyze the process and determine the number of steps required for all coins to show tails, and then find the average value of this number over all possible initial configurations.\n\n### Step 1: Understanding the Process\nThe process involves flipping the \\( k \\)-th coin if there are \\( k \\) coins showing heads, where \\( k > 0 \\). We need to show that this process always terminates and determine the average number of steps required.\n\n### Step 2: Termination of the Process\nTo show that the process always terminates, we need to observe that the number of heads decreases at each step. Let's denote the number of heads at step \\( i \\) by \\( h_i \\). Initially, \\( h_0 = k \\) for some \\( k \\). At each step, the number of heads decreases by 1, so \\( h_{i+1} = h_i - 1 \\). This process continues until \\( h_i = 0 \\), at which point the process stops. Since the number of heads is a non-negative integer and decreases by 1 at each step, it must eventually reach 0. Therefore, the process always terminates.\n\n### Step 3: Determining the Number of Steps\nLet's denote the number of steps required to reach all tails by \\( \\ell(C) \\). We need to find the average value of \\( \\ell(C) \\) over all possible initial configurations \\( C \\).\n\n### Step 4: Symmetry and Average Value\nConsider the symmetry in the problem. For any initial configuration \\( C \\), the number of steps required to reach all tails is the same as the number of steps required to reach all heads, because the process is symmetric with respect to heads and tails. Therefore, the average number of steps to reach all tails is the same as the average number of steps to reach all heads.\n\n### Step 5: Calculating the Average Number of Steps\nTo find the average number of steps, we can use the fact that the process is symmetric and the total number of steps for all configurations is the same as the total number of steps for all configurations where all coins are heads. The total number of steps for all configurations is the sum of the steps for each configuration, which is the same as the sum of the steps for each configuration where all coins are heads.\n\nThe number of steps required to reach all heads from a configuration with \\( k \\) heads is \\( k \\).

The worst-case split occurs when \\( k = 30 \\) (i.e., 30 boxes on each side).\n\n- If Alice distributes \\( n \\) pebbles such that each box has at least 1 pebble, then \\( n \\geq 60 \\).\n\nHowever, we need to ensure that even after Alice's move, no box is left empty. Let's consider the distribution:\n\n- If Alice distributes \\( n = 60 \\) pebbles such that each box has exactly 1 pebble, then after any split, the number of pebbles in each box will be either 0 or 2.

For each pair, the term \\((s - r - n)\\) is multiplied by the product \\(x_r x_s\\).\n\n### Step 2: Simplifying the Expression\nTo simplify the expression, we can rewrite it in a more convenient form.

For example, if \\( n = 4 \\), the elements are:\n   \\[\n   2^4 - 2^0 = 15 = 1111_2, \\quad 2^4 - 2^1 = 14 = 1110_2, \\quad 2^4 - 2^2 = 12 = 1100_2, \\quad 2^4 - 2^3 = 8 = 1000_2\n   \\]\n\n5. **Summing Elements**:\n   Any sum of elements from \\( A_n \\) will have a 1 in the \\( n \\)-th position (since \\( 2^n \\) is always included in the sum). Therefore, the sum will be of the form \\( 2^n + \\text{(sum of elements from } \\{2^0, 2^1, \\ldots, 2^{n-1}\\}) \\).\n\n6. **Largest Integer Not Expressible**:\n   The largest integer that cannot be expressed as a sum of elements from \\( A_n \\) is the largest integer less than \\( 2^n \\) that cannot be expressed as a sum of elements from \\( \\{2^0, 2^1, \\ldots, 2^{n-1}\\} \\). This is because any integer less than \\( 2^n \\) can be expressed as a sum of distinct powers of 2 (by the binary representation theorem).\n\n7. **Conclusion**:\n   The largest integer less than \\( 2^n \\) that cannot be expressed as a sum of distinct powers of 2 is \\( 2^n - 1 \\). However, since we are considering sums of elements from \\( A_n \\), the largest integer that cannot be expressed as a sum of elements from \\( A_n \\) is \\( 2^n - 2 \\).\n\nTherefore, the largest positive integer that cannot be written as the sum of one or more elements of \\( A_n \\) is \\(\\boxed{2^n - 2}\\)."], "id": 1988, "generated_answers": ["2^n - 2"], "gold_answer": "$(n-2) 2^{n}+1$", "is_correct": false, "answers_correctness": [false]}

Let's denote these divisors as \\( d_1, d_2, \\) and \\( d_3 \\).\n\n### Step 1: Understanding the Divisors\nFor a number \\( n \\) to have exactly three distinct positive divisors, \\( n \\) must be of the form \\( p^2 \\) where \\( p \\) is a prime number. This is because the divisors of \\( p^2 \\) are \\( 1, p, \\) and \\( p^2 \\).\n\n### Step 2: Sum of the Divisors\nGiven that the sum of the divisors \\( 1, p, \\) and \\( p^2 \\) is 2022, we can write the equation:\n\\[\n1 + p + p^2 = 2022\n\\]\n\n### Step 3: Solving the Quadratic Equation\nRearrange the equation to form a standard quadratic equation:\n\\[\np^2 + p + 1 - 2022 = 0\n\\]\n\\[\np^2 + p - 2021 = 0\n\\]\n\n### Step 4: Using the Quadratic Formula\nThe quadratic formula \\( p = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \\) can be applied where \\( a = 1 \\), \\( b = 1 \\), and \\( c = -2021 \\):\n\\[\np = \\frac{-1 \\pm \\sqrt{1^2 - 4 \\cdot 1 \\cdot (-2021)}}{2 \\cdot 1}\n\\]\n\\[\np = \\frac{-1 \\pm \\sqrt{1 + 8084}}{2}\n\\]\n\\[\np = \\frac{-1 \\pm \\sqrt{8085}}{2}\n\\]\n\n### Step 5: Finding the Square Root\nWe need to find the square root of 8085.

A \\( k \\)-clique is a set of points in \\( S \\) where every pair of points is \\( k \\)-friends, meaning there exists a third point such that the area of the triangle formed by these three points is \\( k \\).\n\n### Step 1: Understanding the Area Condition\nThe area of a triangle with vertices at \\((x_1, y_1)\\), \\((x_2, y_2)\\), and \\((x_3, y_3)\\) is given by:\n\\[\n\\text{Area} = \\frac{1}{2} \\left| x_1(y_2 - y_3) + x_2(y_3 - y_1) + x_3(y_1 - y_2) \\right|\n\\]\nFor the area to be \\( k \\), we need:\n\\[\n\\left| x_1(y_2 - y_3) + x_2(y_3 - y_1) + x_3(y_1 - y_2) \\right| = 2k\n\\]\n\n### Step 2: Simplifying the Problem\nWe need to find a set of points such that for any two points \\( A \\) and \\( B \\), there exists a point \\( C \\) such that the area of triangle \\( ABC \\) is \\( k \\). This implies that the determinant of the matrix formed by the coordinates of \\( A \\), \\( B \\), and \\( C \\) must be \\( 2k \\).\n\n### Step 3: Considering Specific Points\nLet's consider points on a line \\( y = mx + c \\). For any two points \\( A = (x_1, mx_1 + c) \\) and \\( B = (x_2, mx_2 + c) \\), we need to find a point \\( C = (x_3, mx_3 + c) \\) such that the area of triangle \\( ABC \\) is \\( k \\).\n\n### Step 4: Calculating the Area\nThe area of triangle \\( ABC \\) is:\n\\[\n\\text{Area} = \\frac{1}{2} \\left| x_1(mx_2 + c - mx_3 - c) + x_2(mx_3 + c - mx_1 - c) + x_3(mx_1 + c - mx_2 - c) \\right|\n\\]\nSimplifying, we get:\n\\[\n\\text{Area} = \\frac{1}{2} \\left| x_1(m(x_2 - x_3)) + x_2(m(x_3 - x_1)) + x_3(m(x_1 - x_2)) \\right|\n\\]\n\\[\n= \\frac{1}{2} \\left| m(x_1(x_2 - x_3) + x_2(x_3 - x_1) + x_3(x_1 - x_2)) \\right|\n\\]\n\\[\n= \\frac{1}{2} \\left| m \\cdot 0 \\right|\n\\]\n\\[\n= 0\n\\]\nThis is not possible since the area must be \\( k \\).

For example, consider the points \\((0, 0)\\), \\((1, 0)\\), and \\((0, 1)\\). The area of the triangle formed by these points is:\n\\[\n\\text{Area} = \\frac{1}{2} \\left| 0(0 - 1) + 1(1 - 0) + 0(0 - 0) \\right| = \\frac{1}{2} \\left| 1 \\right| = \\frac{1}{2}\n\\]\nThis is not an integer. We need to find a configuration where the area is an integer.\n\n### Step 6: Finding the Smallest \\( k \\)\nConsider the points \\((0, 0)\\), \\((2, 0)\\), and \\((0, 2)\\). The area of the triangle formed by these points is:\n\\[\n\\text{Area} = \\frac{1}{2} \\left| 0(0 - 2) + 2(2 - 0) + 0(0 - 0) \\right| = \\frac{1}{2} \\left| 4 \\right| = 2\n\\]\nThus, \\( k = 2 \\) is a valid \\( k \\).\n\n### Step 7: Verifying the \\( k \\)-Clique\nWe need to check if there exists a \\( k \\)-clique with more than 200 elements. Consider the points \\((0, 0)\\), \\((2, 0)\\), \\((0, 2)\\), \\((4, 0)\\), \\((0, 4)\\), etc. These points form a grid where the area of any triangle formed by any two points and a third point is 2.\n\n### Step 8: Counting the Points\nThe number of points in a grid of side length \\( n \\) is \\( (n+1)^2 \\).

We will use the principle of complementary counting to find the number of pairs where the product is not divisible by 10, and then subtract this from the total number of pairs.\n\n#### Step 5.1: Count the pairs where the product is not divisible by 10\n- The product is not divisible by 2 if both numbers are odd.\n- The product is not divisible by 5 if neither number is a multiple of 5.\n\n#### Step 5.2: Count the odd numbers and numbers not divisible by 5\n- Odd numbers: \\( 1, 3, 5, 7, 9 \\) (5 numbers)\n- Numbers not divisible by 5: \\( 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9 \\) (8 numbers)\n\n#### Step 5.3: Count the pairs where both numbers are odd and not divisible by 5\n- Odd numbers not divisible by 5: \\( 1, 3, 7, 9 \\) (4 numbers)\n\nThe number of pairs where both numbers are odd and not divisible by 5 is:\n\\[ 4 \\times 4 = 16 \\]\n\n### Step 6: Calculate the number of favorable outcomes\nThe number of pairs where the product is divisible by 10 is:\n\\[ 100 - 16 = 84 \\]\n\n### Step 7: Calculate the probability\nThe probability \\( P(10) \\) is the number of favorable outcomes divided by the total number of possible outcomes:\n\\[ P(10) = \\frac{84}{100} = \\frac{21}{25} \\]\n\nThus, the final answer is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{\\frac{21}{25}}\n\\]"], "id": 2527, "generated_answers": ["\\frac{21}{25}"], "gold_answer": "$\\frac{27}{100}$", "is_correct": false, "answers_correctness": [false]}

The general form of the translated parabola is:\n\\[\ny = (x - (1 + p))^2 + (3 - q)\n\\]\n\n### Step 3: Use the \\( x \\)-intercepts to form the equation\nThe \\( x \\)-intercepts of the translated parabola are given as 3 and 5. Therefore, the parabola passes through the points \\( (3, 0) \\) and \\( (5, 0) \\). We can use these points to form the equation of the parabola.\n\nFirst, substitute \\( (3, 0) \\) into the equation:\n\\[\n0 = (3 - (1 + p))^2 + (3 - q)\n\\]\nSimplify inside the parentheses:\n\\[\n0 = (2 - p)^2 + (3 - q)\n\\]\n\nNext, substitute \\( (5, 0) \\) into the equation:\n\\[\n0 = (5 - (1 + p))^2 + (3 - q)\n\\]\nSimplify inside the parentheses:\n\\[\n0 = (4 - p)^2 + (3 - q)\n\\]\n\n### Step 4: Solve the system of equations\nWe now have two equations:\n1. \\( (2 - p)^2 + (3 - q) = 0 \\)\n2. \\( (4 - p)^2 + (3 - q) = 0 \\)\n\nSubtract the first equation from the second:\n\\[\n(4 - p)^2 + (3 - q) - ((2 - p)^2 + (3 - q)) = 0\n\\]\nSimplify:\n\\[\n(4 - p)^2 - (2 - p)^2 = 0\n\\]\nExpand both squares:\n\\[\n(16 - 8p + p^2) - (4 - 4p + p^2) = 0\n\\]\nCombine like terms:\n\\[\n16 - 8p + p^2 - 4 + 4p - p^2 = 0\n\\]\n\\[\n12 - 4p = 0\n\\]\nSolve for \\( p \\):\n\\[\n4p = 12\n\\]\n\\[\np = 3\n\\]\n\n### Step 5: Find \\( q \\)\nSubstitute \\( p = 3 \\) back into one of the original equations. Use the first equation:\n\\[\n(2 - 3)^2 + (3 - q) = 0\n\\]\nSimplify:\n\\[\n(-1)^2 + (3 - q) = 0\n\\]\n\\[\n1 + 3 - q = 0\n\\]\n\\[\n4 - q = 0\n\\]\nSolve for \\( q \\):\n\\[\nq = 4\n\\]\n\n### Final Answer\nThe values of \\( p \\) and \\( q \\) are:\n\\[\n\\boxed{3 \\text{ and } 4}\n\\]"], "id": 2536, "generated_answers": ["3 \\text{ and } 4"], "gold_answer": "3,4", "is_correct": true, "answers_correctness": [true]}

Therefore, the pattern can continue indefinitely with 9s.\n\n6. **Conclusion:**\n   - The greatest fibbish number is the largest number we can form with the pattern 99999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999"], "id": 2663, "generated_answers": [""], "gold_answer": "10112369", "is_correct": false, "answers_correctness": [false]}

Since \\(PQRS\\) is a square with side length 24 and \\(C\\) is the right angle, we can place the points as follows:\n- \\(P\\) is on \\(AB\\) and has coordinates \\((x, y)\\).\n- \\(Q\\) is on \\(AB\\) and has coordinates \\((x + 24, y - 24)\\).\n- \\(R\\) is on \\(\\ell\\) and has coordinates \\((24, 24)\\).\n- \\(S\\) is on \\(\\ell\\) and has coordinates \\((0, 24)\\).\n\n### Step 3: Find the coordinates of \\(P\\) and \\(Q\\)\nSince \\(P\\) and \\(Q\\) lie on \\(AB\\), we can use the equation of line \\(AB\\):\n\\[\ny = -\\frac{b}{a}x + b\n\\]\nSubstitute \\(x = x\\) and \\(y = y\\) into the equation:\n\\[\ny = -\\frac{b}{a}x + b\n\\]\nSubstitute \\(x = x + 24\\) and \\(y = y - 24\\) into the equation:\n\\[\ny - 24 = -\\frac{b}{a}(x + 24) + b\n\\]\nSimplify:\n\\[\ny - 24 = -\\frac{b}{a}x - \\frac{24b}{a} + b\n\\]\n\\[\ny = -\\frac{b}{a}x + b - 24 + \\frac{24b}{a}\n\\]\nSince \\(y = -\\frac{b}{a}x + b\\), we equate the two expressions for \\(y\\):\n\\[\n-\\frac{b}{a}x + b = -\\frac{b}{a}x + b - 24 + \\frac{24b}{a}\n\\]\n\\[\n0 = -24 + \\frac{24b}{a}\n\\]\n\\[\n24 = \\frac{24b}{a}\n\\]\n\\[\na = b\n\\]\n\n### Step 4: Determine the inradius of \\(\\triangle ABC\\)\nGiven that the inradius \\(r\\) of \\(\\triangle ABC\\) is 10, we use the formula for the inradius of a right triangle:\n\\[\nr = \\frac{a + b - c}{2}\n\\]\nSince \\(a = b\\), we have:\n\\[\nr = \\frac{a + a - \\sqrt{2a^2}}{2} = \\frac{2a - a\\sqrt{2}}{2} = a(1 - \\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2})\n\\]\nGiven \\(r = 10\\):\n\\[\n10 = a(1 - \\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2})\n\\]\n\\[\na = \\frac{10}{1 - \\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2}} = \\frac{10}{\\frac{2 - \\sqrt{2}}{2}} = \\frac{20}{2 - \\sqrt{2}} \\cdot \\frac{2 + \\sqrt{2}}{2 + \\sqrt{2}} = \\frac{20(2 + \\sqrt{2})}{4 - 2} = 10(2 + \\sqrt{2}) = 20 + 10\\sqrt{2}\n\\]\n\n### Step 5: Determine the inradii of the smaller triangles\nThe inradius of a triangle is proportional to the area of the triangle divided by its semiperimeter.

We need to determine which of these integers is the mean, median, and mode.\n\n### Step 1: Determine the Mode\nThe mode is the number that appears most frequently in the list. Since the mode is unique, it must appear more frequently than any other number in the list.\n\n### Step 2: Determine the Median\nThe median is the middle number when the list is sorted. If the list has an odd number of elements, the median is the middle element. If the list has an even number of elements, the median is the average of the two middle elements.\n\n### Step 3: Determine the Mean\nThe mean is the sum of all the numbers in the list divided by the number of elements in the list.\n\n### Step 4: Consider Different Cases\nWe need to consider different cases for the positions of \\( n-1 \\), \\( n \\), and \\( n+1 \\) in the list.\n\n#### Case 1: Mode = \\( n-1 \\)\nIf \\( n-1 \\) is the mode, it must appear more frequently than \\( n \\) and \\( n+1 \\). Let's assume the list has 5 elements for simplicity. The list could be:\n\\[ n-1, n-1, n-1, n, n+1 \\]\n\n- Mode: \\( n-1 \\)\n- Median: \\( n-1 \\)\n- Mean: \\(\\frac{(n-1) + (n-1) + (n-1) + n + (n+1)}{5} = \\frac{5n - 2}{5} = n - \\frac{2}{5}\\)\n\nSince the mean must be an integer, \\( n - \\frac{2}{5} \\) must be an integer, which is not possible. Therefore, this case is invalid.\n\n#### Case 2: Mode = \\( n \\)\nIf \\( n \\) is the mode, it must appear more frequently than \\( n-1 \\) and \\( n+1 \\). Let's assume the list has 5 elements for simplicity. The list could be:\n\\[ n, n, n, n-1, n+1 \\]\n\n- Mode: \\( n \\)\n- Median: \\( n \\)\n- Mean: \\(\\frac{n + n + n + (n-1) + (n+1)}{5} = \\frac{5n}{5} = n\\)\n\nThis case is valid. The sum of the integers in the list is:\n\\[ n + n + n + (n-1) + (n+1) = 5n \\]\n\nTo minimize the sum, we choose the smallest possible value for \\( n \\). Since \\( n \\) must be a positive integer, the smallest value is \\( n = 1 \\).\n\nHowever, if \\( n = 1 \\), the list would be:\n\\[ 1, 1, 1, 0, 2 \\]\n\nThis list is not valid because it contains a zero, which is not a positive integer. Therefore, we need to try the next smallest value for \\( n \\).\n\n#### Case 3: Mode = \\( n+1 \\)\nIf \\( n+1 \\) is the mode, it must appear more frequently than \\( n-1 \\) and \\( n \\). Let's assume the list has 5 elements for simplicity. The list could be:\n\\[ n+1, n+1, n+1, n, n-1 \\]\n\n- Mode: \\( n+1 \\)\n- Median: \\( n+1 \\)\n- Mean: \\(\\frac{(n+1) + (n+1) + (n+1) + n + (n-1)}{5} = \\frac{5n + 3}{5} = n + \\frac{3}{5}\\)\n\nSince the mean must be an integer, \\( n + \\frac{3}{5} \\) must be an integer, which is not possible. Therefore, this case is invalid.\n\n### Conclusion\nThe only valid case is when the mode is \\( n \\), and the smallest possible value for \\( n \\) is 2. The list is:\n\\[ 2, 2, 2, 1, 3 \\]\n\nThe sum of the integers in the list is:\n\\[ 2 + 2 + 2 + 1 + 3 = 10 \\]\n\nThus, the least possible sum of the integers in the original list is \\(\\boxed{10}\\)."], "id": 2766, "generated_answers": ["10"], "gold_answer": "12", "is_correct": false, "answers_correctness": [false]}

We will follow these steps:\n\n1. **Determine the side length of the square:**\n   The area of the square is given as 650. The side length \\( s \\) of the square can be found using the formula for the area of a square:\n   \\[\n   s^2 = 650 \\implies s = \\sqrt{650} = 5\\sqrt{26}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Find the coordinates of the vertices of the square:**\n   Let the vertices of the square be \\( A, B, C, \\) and \\( D \\) in clockwise order.

We need to color the diagonals either red or blue such that every triangle formed by any three vertices of the hexagon has at least one red side.\n\n### Step 2: Counting the Diagonals\nA hexagon has 9 diagonals.

We also need to check the perimeter condition \\(a + b + c = 2019\\).\n\n   After testing possible values, we find that:\n   \\[\n   a = 1130, \\quad b = 889, \\quad c = 1000\n   \\]\n\n8. **Verify the solution:**\n   - Perimeter: \\(1130 + 889 + 1000 = 2019\\)\n   - Angle Bisector Theorem: \\(\\frac{229}{1000 - 229} = \\frac{889}{1130}\\)\n   - Simplify: \\(\\frac{229}{771} = \\frac{889}{1130}\\)\n   - Both sides are equal, and \\(AC = 889\\) and \\(AD = 229\\) are relatively prime.\n\nThus, the length of \\(BC\\) is \\(\\boxed{1130}\\)."], "id": 2979, "generated_answers": ["1130"], "gold_answer": "888", "is_correct": false, "answers_correctness": [false]}

This means \\(d\\) must be at least as large as the largest of \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\).\n\n### Step 2: Estimating the Size of \\(d\\)\nSince \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are positive integers, their factorials grow very quickly. We need to find a reasonable upper bound for \\(d\\). Given \\(a + b + c + d = 37\\), if \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are small, \\(d\\) must be close to 37.\n\n### Step 3: Testing Small Values for \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\)\nWe start by testing small values for \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) and see if we can find a combination that satisfies both equations.\n\n#### Case 1: \\(a = 1\\)\nIf \\(a = 1\\), then \\(1! = 1\\), and the equation simplifies to \\(b! \\cdot c! = d!\\). We need \\(b + c + d = 36\\).\n\n- If \\(b = 1\\), then \\(1! \\cdot 1! = 1\\), and \\(c! = d!\\). This implies \\(c = d\\), but \\(c + d = 35\\) is not possible since \\(c\\) and \\(d\\) must be distinct.\n- If \\(b = 2\\), then \\(2! = 2\\), and \\(2 \\cdot c! = d!\\). We need \\(2 + c + d = 36\\), so \\(c + d = 34\\). Testing \\(c = 3\\), \\(3! = 6\\), and \\(2 \\cdot 6 = 12\\), which is not a factorial.\n- If \\(b = 3\\), then \\(3! = 6\\), and \\(6 \\cdot c! = d!\\). We need \\(3 + c + d = 36\\), so \\(c + d = 33\\). Testing \\(c = 4\\), \\(4! = 24\\), and \\(6 \\cdot 24 = 144\\), which is not a factorial.\n- If \\(b = 4\\), then \\(4! = 24\\), and \\(24 \\cdot c! = d!\\). We need \\(4 + c + d = 36\\), so \\(c + d = 32\\). Testing \\(c = 5\\), \\(5! = 120\\), and \\(24 \\cdot 120 = 2880\\), which is not a factorial.\n- If \\(b = 5\\), then \\(5! = 120\\), and \\(120 \\cdot c! = d!\\). We need \\(5 + c + d = 36\\), so \\(c + d = 31\\). Testing \\(c = 6\\), \\(6! = 720\\), and \\(120 \\cdot 720 = 86400\\), which is not a factorial.\n- If \\(b = 6\\), then \\(6! = 720\\), and \\(720 \\cdot c! = d!\\). We need \\(6 + c + d = 36\\), so \\(c + d = 30\\). Testing \\(c = 7\\), \\(7! = 5040\\), and \\(720 \\cdot 5040 = 3628800\\), which is \\(10!\\). This works.\n\nThus, \\(a = 1\\), \\(b = 6\\), \\(c = 7\\), and \\(d = 10\\).\n\n### Step 4: Verifying the Solution\nWe verify the solution:\n- \\(a + b + c + d = 1 + 6 + 7 + 10 = 24\\), which is correct.\n- \\(a! \\cdot b! \\cdot c! = 1! \\cdot 6! \\cdot 7! = 1 \\cdot 720 \\cdot 5040 = 3628800 = 10!\\), which is correct.\n\n### Step 5: Calculating the Product \\(abcd\\)\nThe product \\(abcd\\) is:\n\\[\n1 \\cdot 6 \\cdot 7 \\cdot 10 = 420\n\\]\n\nThus, the final answer is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{420}\n\\]"], "id": 2983, "generated_answers": ["420"], "gold_answer": "2240", "is_correct": false, "answers_correctness": [false]}
