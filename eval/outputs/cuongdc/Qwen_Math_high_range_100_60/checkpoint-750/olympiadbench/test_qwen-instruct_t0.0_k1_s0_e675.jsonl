This means that \\( N \\equiv a_k \\pmod{k} \\) for each \\( k \\).\n\nSergey's goal is to determine \\( N \\) by asking questions about the set \\( \\{a_k : k \\in S\\} \\) for some subset \\( S \\) of \\(\\{1, 2, \\ldots, 20\\}\\).\n\n### Step-by-Step Solution:\n\n1. **Understanding the Problem:**\n   - \\( N \\) is a positive integer such that \\( 1 \\leq N \\leq 5000 \\).\n   - \\( a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_{20} \\) are distinct positive integers.\n   - For each \\( k \\), \\( N \\equiv a_k \\pmod{k} \\).\n\n2. **Prime Factorization and Chinese Remainder Theorem:**\n   - The numbers \\( 1, 2, \\ldots, 20 \\) have the following prime factorizations:\n     \\[\n     \\begin{aligned}\n     1 & : 1 \\\\\n     2 & : 2 \\\\\n     3 & : 3 \\\\\n     4 & : 2^2 \\\\\n     5 & : 5 \\\\\n     6 & : 2 \\cdot 3 \\\\\n     7 & : 7 \\\\\n     8 & : 2^3 \\\\\n     9 & : 3^2 \\\\\n     10 & : 2 \\cdot 5 \\\\\n     11 & : 11 \\\\\n     12 & : 2^2 \\cdot 3 \\\\\n     13 & : 13 \\\\\n     14 & : 2 \\cdot 7 \\\\\n     15 & : 3 \\cdot 5 \\\\\n     16 & : 2^4 \\\\\n     17 & : 17 \\\\\n     18 & : 2 \\cdot 3^2 \\\\\n     19 & : 19 \\\\\n     20 & : 2^2 \\cdot 5 \\\\\n     \\end{aligned}\n     \\]\n   - The least common multiple (LCM) of these numbers is:\n     \\[\n     \\text{LCM}(1, 2, \\ldots, 20) = 2^4 \\cdot 3^2 \\cdot 5 \\cdot 7 \\cdot 11 \\cdot 13 \\cdot 17 \\cdot 19 = 232792560\n     \\]\n   - Since \\( N \\leq 5000 \\), \\( N \\) must be determined within the range of 1 to 5000.\n\n3. **Using the Chinese Remainder Theorem:**\n   - The Chinese Remainder Theorem (CRT) states that if we have a system of congruences:\n     \\[\n     N \\equiv a_1 \\pmod{1}, \\quad N \\equiv a_2 \\pmod{2}, \\quad \\ldots, \\quad N \\equiv a_{20} \\pmod{20}\n     \\]\n     then there is a unique solution modulo the LCM of the moduli, which is 232792560. However, since \\( N \\leq 5000 \\), we only need to consider the solution within this range.\n\n4. **Determining the Number of Moves:**\n   - To determine \\( N \\) uniquely, Sergey needs to ask questions that will help him narrow down the possible values of \\( N \\).\n   - Each move allows Sergey to ask about a subset \\( S \\) of \\(\\{1, 2, \\ldots, 20\\}\\) and receive the set \\(\\{a_k : k \\in S\\}\\).\n   - The key is to use the CRT to reduce the number of possible values of \\( N \\) with each move.\n\n5. **Optimal Strategy:**\n   - The optimal strategy is to use the CRT to reduce the number of possible values of \\( N \\) by half with each move.\n   - Since \\( N \\) can be any number from 1 to 5000, the number of possible values is 5000.\n   - Each move reduces the number of possible values by a factor of 2.\n\n6. **Calculating the Number of Moves:**\n   - To reduce 5000 to 1, we need to take the logarithm base 2 of 5000:\n     \\[\n     \\log_2 5000 \\approx 12.29\n     \\]\n   - Since we need a whole number of moves, we round up to the next integer:\n     \\[\n     \\lceil 12.29 \\rceil = 13\n     \\]\n\nTherefore, the number of moves Sergey needs to determine for sure the number Xenia thought of is \\(\\boxed{13}\\)."], "id": 1606, "generated_answers": ["13"], "gold_answer": "2", "is_correct": false, "answers_correctness": [false]}

If we place kings on all the black squares, no two kings will be adjacent.\n- **Counting Kings**: In a \\(100 \\times 100\\) board, there are \\(100 \\times 100 = 10000\\) squares. Half of these squares are black, so there are \\(5000\\) black squares.\n- **Adjusting the Pattern**: To place exactly 2500 kings, we need to adjust the pattern. We can place kings on every other black square in a checkerboard pattern, which will result in placing kings on \\(2500\\) squares.\n\n### Step 4: Ensuring Row and Column Constraints\n- **Row and Column Distribution**: In the adjusted checkerboard pattern, each row and each column will contain exactly 25 kings. This is because the pattern is uniform and each row and column will have an equal number of black squares.\n\n### Step 5: Counting the Arrangements\n- **Symmetry and Rotation**: The problem states that arrangements differing by rotation or symmetry are considered different. Therefore, we need to count all possible distinct arrangements.\n- **Checkerboard Pattern**: There are two distinct checkerboard patterns: one starting with a king on a black square and one starting with a king on a white square.\n\n### Step 6: Conclusion\nSince there are two distinct checkerboard patterns that satisfy all the given conditions, the number of such arrangements is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{2}\n\\]"], "id": 1724, "generated_answers": ["2"], "gold_answer": "2", "is_correct": true, "answers_correctness": [true]}

If \\( f_i(x) \\) are polynomials, then the degree of \\( f_i(x)^2 \\) is \\( 2 \\deg(f_i(x)) \\).

We will then show that there are only finitely many positive integers which are not \\( n \\)-colourful and find the largest among them.\n\n### Step 1: Understanding \\( n \\)-colourful\nAn integer \\( m \\geq n+1 \\) is \\( n \\)-colourful if, given infinitely many marbles in each of \\( n \\) colours \\( C_1, C_2, \\ldots, C_n \\), it is possible to place \\( m \\) marbles around a circle such that in any group of \\( n+1 \\) consecutive marbles, there is at least one marble of each colour \\( C_i \\) for \\( i = 1, \\ldots, n \\).\n\n### Step 2: Necessary Condition for \\( n \\)-colourful\nConsider the total number of marbles \\( m \\). For \\( m \\) to be \\( n \\)-colourful, we need to ensure that in any group of \\( n+1 \\) consecutive marbles, each of the \\( n \\) colours appears at least once. This implies that the total number of marbles \\( m \\) must be at least \\( n(n+1) \\).\n\n### Step 3: Sufficient Condition for \\( n \\)-colourful\nTo show that \\( m = n(n+1) \\) is \\( n \\)-colourful, we can construct a specific arrangement. Consider the following pattern:\n- Place \\( n \\) marbles of each colour \\( C_1, C_2, \\ldots, C_n \\) in a sequence.\n- Repeat this sequence \\( n \\) times.\n\nThis results in a total of \\( n \\times n = n^2 \\) marbles of each colour, giving a total of \\( n \\times n^2 = n^3 \\) marbles. However, we need to ensure that any group of \\( n+1 \\) consecutive marbles contains all \\( n \\) colours. To achieve this, we can interleave the sequences in a way that ensures every group of \\( n+1 \\) consecutive marbles includes all \\( n \\) colours.\n\n### Step 4: Verification\nTo verify, consider the sequence:\n\\[ C_1, C_2, \\ldots, C_n, C_1, C_2, \\ldots, C_n, \\ldots, C_1, C_2, \\ldots, C_n \\]\nwhere each sequence of \\( n \\) marbles is repeated \\( n \\) times. In any group of \\( n+1 \\) consecutive marbles, there will be at least one marble of each colour \\( C_i \\) because the sequence is repeated and each colour appears in every block of \\( n \\) marbles.\n\n### Step 5: Conclusion\nThus, \\( m = n(n+1) \\) is \\( n \\)-colourful. Any \\( m < n(n+1) \\) will not satisfy the condition because there will be a group of \\( n+1 \\) consecutive marbles that does not contain all \\( n \\) colours.\n\n### Step 6: Finitely Many Non-\\( n \\)-colourful Integers\nSince \\( m = n(n+1) \\) is the smallest \\( n \\)-colourful integer, all integers \\( m < n(n+1) \\) are not \\( n \\)-colourful.

Now, we need to check if there are any other pairs of prime numbers \\((p, q)\\) with \\(p > q\\) that satisfy the condition.\n\nAssume \\(p\\) and \\(q\\) are both odd primes. Then, \\(p + q\\) and \\(p - q\\) are both even. Let \\(p + q = 2a\\) and \\(p - q = 2b\\) for some integers \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). Then, the expression becomes:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{(2a)^{2a}(2b)^{2b} - 1}{(2a)^{2b}(2b)^{2a} - 1}\n\\]\n\nThis expression is not necessarily an integer because the numerator and the denominator are not necessarily divisible by each other. Therefore, we need to check if there are any other pairs of prime numbers that satisfy the condition.\n\nNow, let's consider the case when \\(p = 3\\) and \\(q = 2\\). Then, we have:\n\n\\[\np + q = 5 \\quad \\text{and} \\quad p - q = 1\n\\]\n\nSubstituting these values into the expression, we get:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{5^5 \\cdot 1^1 - 1}{5^1 \\cdot 1^5 - 1} = \\frac{3125 - 1}{5 - 1} = \\frac{3124}{4} = 781\n\\]\n\nSince 781 is an integer, the pair \\((3, 2)\\) satisfies the condition. However, we need to check if there are any other pairs of prime numbers that satisfy the condition.\n\nAfter checking all possible pairs of prime numbers, we find that the only pairs that satisfy the condition are \\((2, 1)\\) and \\((3, 2)\\).\n\nTherefore, the pairs \\((p, q)\\) of prime numbers with \\(p > q\\) for which the given expression is an integer are \\((2, 1)\\) and \\((3, 2)\\).\n\nThe final answer is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{(2, 1), (3, 2)}\n\\]"], "id": 1833, "generated_answers": ["(2, 1), (3, 2)"], "gold_answer": "$(3,2)$", "is_correct": false, "answers_correctness": [false]}

A set is fragrant if none of its elements is relatively prime to the product of the other elements.\n\n### Step 1: Understanding the Polynomial\nThe polynomial \\( P(n) = n^2 + n + 1 \\) can be rewritten as:\n\\[\nP(n) = n(n+1) + 1\n\\]\nThis form shows that \\( P(n) \\) is always one more than a product of two consecutive integers, which means \\( P(n) \\) is always odd and greater than 1.\n\n### Step 2: Relatively Prime Condition\nFor a set to be fragrant, no element in the set should be relatively prime to the product of the other elements. This means that for any element \\( P(a+i) \\) in the set, there must be a common factor between \\( P(a+i) \\) and the product of the other elements in the set.\n\n### Step 3: Analyzing Small Sets\nWe will start by analyzing small sets to find the smallest size of a fragrant set.\n\n#### Set of Size 2\nConsider the set \\( \\{P(a), P(a+1)\\} \\):\n\\[\nP(a) = a^2 + a + 1\n\\]\n\\[\nP(a+1) = (a+1)^2 + (a+1) + 1 = a^2 + 3a + 3\n\\]\nWe need to check if \\( P(a) \\) and \\( P(a+1) \\) are relatively prime. The greatest common divisor (gcd) of \\( P(a) \\) and \\( P(a+1) \\) is:\n\\[\n\\gcd(a^2 + a + 1, a^2 + 3a + 3)\n\\]\nUsing the Euclidean algorithm:\n\\[\n\\gcd(a^2 + a + 1, a^2 + 3a + 3) = \\gcd(a^2 + a + 1, (a^2 + 3a + 3) - (a^2 + a + 1)) = \\gcd(a^2 + a + 1, 2a + 2)\n\\]\n\\[\n\\gcd(a^2 + a + 1, 2a + 2) = \\gcd(a^2 + a + 1, 2(a + 1))\n\\]\nSince \\( a^2 + a + 1 \\) is always odd, it is not divisible by 2.

(For example, the process starting with THT would be THT $\\rightarrow H H T \\rightarrow H T T \\rightarrow T T T$, which takes three steps.)\n\nLetting $C$ denote the initial configuration (a sequence of $n H$ 's and $T$ 's), write $\\ell(C)$ for the number of steps needed before all coins show $T$. Show that this number $\\ell(C)$ is finite, and determine its average value over all $2^{n}$ possible initial configurations $C$.", "generated_responses": ["To solve the problem, we need to analyze the process of flipping the coins and determine the number of steps required to reach a state where all coins show tails.

This is because flipping the \\( k \\)-th coin (where \\( k \\) is the number of heads) will either:\n- Change a head to a tail, reducing the number of heads by 1.\n- Change a tail to a head, increasing the number of heads by 1, but this will not happen if \\( k \\) is the number of heads.\n\nSince the number of heads decreases by at least one with each operation, and the number of heads is a non-negative integer, the process must terminate after a finite number of steps.\n\n### Step 3: Determining the Average Number of Steps\nTo find the average number of steps over all possible initial configurations, we need to consider the symmetry and the nature of the process.\n\n1. **Symmetry**: The process is symmetric with respect to the number of heads and tails. For any configuration \\( C \\) with \\( k \\) heads, there is a corresponding configuration with \\( n - k \\) heads (by flipping all coins).\n2. **Expected Value**: The expected number of steps to reach all tails from a configuration with \\( k \\) heads is the same as the expected number of steps to reach all heads from a configuration with \\( n - k \\) heads.\n\nLet \\( E(k) \\) be the expected number of steps to reach all tails starting from a configuration with \\( k \\) heads.

This symmetry implies that the expected number of steps is the same for all \\( k \\).\n\nThe expected number of steps to reach all tails from any configuration is given by the sum of the reciprocals of the first \\( n \\) positive integers, which is the \\( n \\)-th harmonic number \\( H_n \\):\n\\[ H_n = \\sum_{i=1}^{n} \\frac{1}{i} \\]\n\n### Step 6: Conclusion\nThe average number of steps needed before all coins show tails is the \\( n \\)-th harmonic number \\( H_n \\).\n\nThus, the final answer is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{H_n}\n\\]"], "id": 1914, "generated_answers": ["H_n"], "gold_answer": "$\\frac{1}{4} n(n+1)$", "is_correct": false, "answers_correctness": [false]}

This means a knight can attack any square that is two squares away horizontally and one square away vertically, or two squares away vertically and one square away horizontally.\n\n### Step 2: Knight's Independence\nTo ensure no two knights attack each other, we need to place them on squares such that no two knights are within the knight's attack range.

Two points \\( A \\) and \\( B \\) are \\( k \\)-friends if there exists a point \\( C \\) such that the area of triangle \\( ABC \\) is \\( k \\).\n\n### Step 1: Understanding the Area Condition\nThe area of a triangle with vertices \\((x_1, y_1)\\), \\((x_2, y_2)\\), and \\((x_3, y_3)\\) is given by:\n\\[\n\\text{Area} = \\frac{1}{2} \\left| x_1(y_2 - y_3) + x_2(y_3 - y_1) + x_3(y_1 - y_2) \\right|\n\\]\nFor the area to be \\( k \\), we need:\n\\[\n\\left| x_1(y_2 - y_3) + x_2(y_3 - y_1) + x_3(y_1 - y_2) \\right| = 2k\n\\]\n\n### Step 2: Constructing a \\( k \\)-Clique\nWe need to find a set of points such that the area condition holds for any pair of points in the set. Consider the set of points on a line with integer coordinates. For example, consider the line \\( y = 0 \\) (the x-axis). Any two points on this line, say \\((x_1, 0)\\) and \\((x_2, 0)\\), can be paired with any point \\((x_3, y_3)\\) such that the area of the triangle is \\( k \\).\n\n### Step 3: Specific Example\nLet's consider the points on the x-axis: \\((0, 0)\\), \\((1, 0)\\), \\((2, 0)\\), \\(\\ldots\\), \\((200, 0)\\). We need to find a point \\((x_3, y_3)\\) such that the area of the triangle formed by any two points on the x-axis and \\((x_3, y_3)\\) is \\( k \\).\n\n### Step 4: Calculating the Area\nFor any two points \\((x_1, 0)\\) and \\((x_2, 0)\\) on the x-axis, the area of the triangle with a third point \\((x_3, y_3)\\) is:\n\\[\n\\text{Area} = \\frac{1}{2} \\left| x_1(0 - y_3) + x_2(y_3 - 0) + x_3(0 - 0) \\right| = \\frac{1}{2} \\left| x_1 y_3 - x_2 y_3 \\right| = \\frac{1}{2} \\left| y_3 (x_1 - x_2) \\right|\n\\]\nTo make the area \\( k \\), we need:\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{2} \\left| y_3 (x_1 - x_2) \\right| = k \\implies \\left| y_3 (x_1 - x_2) \\right| = 2k\n\\]\n\n### Step 5: Choosing \\( y_3 \\)\nTo ensure that the area condition holds for any pair of points on the x-axis, we can choose \\( y_3 = 1 \\). Then:\n\\[\n\\left| x_1 - x_2 \\right| = 2k\n\\]\nThis means that the distance between any two points on the x-axis must be \\( 2k \\).\n\n### Step 6: Determining \\( k \\)\nTo have more than 200 points on the x-axis, the distance between the first and the last point must be at least \\( 200 \\times 2k - 1 \\). Therefore:\n\\[\n2k \\times 200 - 1 \\geq 200 \\implies 400k - 1 \\geq 200 \\implies 400k \\geq 201 \\implies k \\geq \\frac{201}{400} \\implies k \\geq 0.5025\n\\]\nSince \\( k \\) must be a positive integer, the smallest \\( k \\) is 1.\n\n### Step 7: Verification\nFor \\( k = 1 \\), the points on the x-axis are \\((0, 0)\\), \\((2, 0)\\), \\((4, 0)\\), \\(\\ldots\\), \\((398, 0)\\).

A topological sort is a linear ordering of the vertices such that for every directed edge \\( u \\rightarrow v \\), vertex \\( u \\) comes before vertex \\( v \\) in the ordering.\n\nLet's break down the problem step by step:\n\n1. **Identify the constraints and the structure:**\n   - \\( G \\) must come before \\( P \\) and \\( P \\) must come before \\( B \\).\n   - \\( M \\) must come before \\( J \\) and \\( J \\) must come before \\( C \\).\n\n2. **Consider the constraints separately:**\n   - For the sequence \\( G, P, B \\), there is only one way to arrange them: \\( G, P, B \\).\n   - For the sequence \\( M, J, C \\), there is only one way to arrange them: \\( M, J, C \\).\n\n3. **Combine the sequences:**\n   - We need to interleave the sequences \\( G, P, B \\) and \\( M, J, C \\) while maintaining the order within each sequence.\n\n4. **Count the number of ways to interleave the sequences:**\n   - We have 6 positions to fill with 3 elements from \\( G, P, B \\) and 3 elements from \\( M, J, C \\).\n   - The number of ways to choose 3 positions out of 6 for the elements from \\( G, P, B \\) is given by the binomial coefficient \\( \\binom{6}{3} \\).\n\n5. **Calculate the binomial coefficient:**\n   \\[\n   \\binom{6}{3} = \\frac{6!}{3!3!} = \\frac{6 \\times 5 \\times 4}{3 \\times 2 \\times 1} = 20\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, the number of acceptable lineups is \\(\\boxed{20}\\)."], "id": 2600, "generated_answers": ["20"], "gold_answer": "20", "is_correct": true, "answers_correctness": [true]}

{"question": "In each town in ARMLandia, the residents have formed groups, which meet each week to share math problems and enjoy each others' company over a potluck-style dinner. Each town resident belongs to exactly one group. Every week, each resident is required to make one dish and to bring it to his/her group.\n\nIt so happens that each resident knows how to make precisely two dishes. Moreover, no two residents of a town know how to make the same pair of dishes. Shown below are two example towns. In the left column are the names of the town's residents. Adjacent to each name is the list of dishes that the corresponding resident knows how to make.\n\n| ARMLton |  |\n| :--- | :--- |\n| Resident | Dishes |\n| Paul | pie, turkey |\n| Arnold | pie, salad |\n| Kelly | salad, broth |\n\n\n| ARMLville |  |\n| :--- | :--- |\n| Resident | Dishes |\n| Sally | steak, calzones |\n| Ross | calzones, pancakes |\n| David | steak, pancakes |\n\nThe population of a town $T$, denoted $\\operatorname{pop}(T)$, is the number of residents of $T$. Formally, the town itself is simply the set of its residents, denoted by $\\left\\{r_{1}, \\ldots, r_{\\mathrm{pop}(T)}\\right\\}$ unless otherwise specified. The set of dishes that the residents of $T$ collectively know how to make is denoted $\\operatorname{dish}(T)$. For example, in the town of ARMLton described above, pop(ARMLton) $=3$, and dish(ARMLton) $=$ \\{pie, turkey, salad, broth\\}.\n\nA town $T$ is called full if for every pair of dishes in $\\operatorname{dish}(T)$, there is exactly one resident in $T$ who knows how to make those two dishes. In the examples above, ARMLville is a full town, but ARMLton is not, because (for example) nobody in ARMLton knows how to make both turkey and salad.\n\nDenote by $\\mathcal{F}_{d}$ a full town in which collectively the residents know how to make $d$ dishes. That is, $\\left|\\operatorname{dish}\\left(\\mathcal{F}_{d}\\right)\\right|=d$.\n\nIn order to avoid the embarrassing situation where two people bring the same dish to a group dinner, if two people know how to make a common dish, they are forbidden from participating in the same group meeting. Formally, a group assignment on $T$ is a function $f: T \\rightarrow\\{1,2, \\ldots, k\\}$, satisfying the condition that if $f\\left(r_{i}\\right)=f\\left(r_{j}\\right)$ for $i \\neq j$, then $r_{i}$ and $r_{j}$ do not know any of the same recipes. The group number of a town $T$, denoted $\\operatorname{gr}(T)$, is the least positive integer $k$ for which there exists a group assignment on $T$.\n\nFor example, consider once again the town of ARMLton. A valid group assignment would be $f($ Paul $)=f($ Kelly $)=1$ and $f($ Arnold $)=2$. The function which gives the value 1 to each resident of ARMLton is not a group assignment, because Paul and Arnold must be assigned to different groups.\n\n\nFor a dish $D$, a resident is called a $D$-chef if he or she knows how to make the dish $D$. Define $\\operatorname{chef}_{T}(D)$ to be the set of residents in $T$ who are $D$-chefs. For example, in ARMLville, David is a steak-chef and a pancakes-chef.

Two resident cycles are indistinguishable if they contain the same residents (in any order), and distinguishable otherwise.

Following the dictum \"location, location, location,\" this Power Question will refer to \"houses\" and \"house numbers\" interchangeably.\n\nCuriously, the arrangement of the houses is such that the distance from house $n$ to house $m$, written $d(m, n)$, is simply $d(m-n)$. For example, $d(3,4)=d(-1)=1$ because $-1=3^{0} \\cdot-1$. In particular, if $m=n$, then $d(m, n)=0$.\n\n\nThe neighborhood of a house $n$, written $\\mathcal{N}(n)$, is the set of all houses that are the same distance from City Hall as $n$. In symbols, $\\mathcal{N}(n)=\\{m \\mid d(m)=d(n)\\}$. Geometrically, it may be helpful to think of $\\mathcal{N}(n)$ as a circle centered at City Hall with radius $d(n)$.\n\nLater, ARMLopolis finally decides on a drastic expansion plan: now house numbers will be rational numbers. To define $d(p / q)$, with $p$ and $q$ integers such that $p q \\neq 0$, write $p / q=3^{k} p^{\\prime} / q^{\\prime}$, where neither $p^{\\prime}$ nor $q^{\\prime}$ is divisible by 3 and $k$ is an integer (not necessarily positive); then $d(p / q)=3^{-k}$.\nCompute $d(3 / 5), d(5 / 8)$, and $d(7 / 18)$.", "generated_responses": ["To solve for \\( d(3/5) \\), \\( d(5/8) \\), and \\( d(7/18) \\), we need to express each fraction in the form \\( 3^k \\cdot \\frac{p'}{q'} \\) where \\( p' \\) and \\( q' \\) are integers not divisible by 3, and then determine the value of \\( k \\).\n\n### Step 1: Compute \\( d(3/5) \\)\n1.

We will use the concept of necklaces in combinatorics, which are circular arrangements of objects that are considered the same if they can be rotated into each other.\n\n### Step 1: Identify the possible number of integers\nThe sum of the integers is 17. We need to consider all possible numbers of integers \\( n \\) such that the sum of \\( n \\) positive integers equals 17. The minimum number of integers is 1 (which is not useful for a circular arrangement), and the maximum number of integers is 17 (each being 1).\n\n### Step 2: Use the formula for the number of necklaces\nThe number of distinct necklaces of length \\( n \\) with a given sum \\( S \\) can be found using the generating function approach or by using known results in combinatorial enumeration. However, for small values of \\( n \\), we can use a more straightforward approach by considering the partitions of 17 and then counting the distinct necklaces.\n\n### Step 3: List the partitions of 17\nWe list the partitions of 17 and then count the distinct necklaces for each partition.\n\n- **17**: (17) -

Since \\( \\triangle ABC \\) is isosceles, the incenter lies on the altitude from \\( A \\) to \\( BC \\). This point is not a valid solution because it does not form isosceles triangles with all sides of \\( \\triangle ABC \\).\n\n#### Case 2: \\( P \\) is the excenter opposite \\( A \\)\nThe excenter opposite \\( A \\) is the point where the external angle bisectors of \\( \\angle B \\) and \\( \\angle C \\) intersect.

Compute the number of ways that Kay can paint the five fingernails on her left hand by using at least three colors and such that no two consecutive fingernails have the same color.", "generated_responses": ["To solve the problem, we need to determine the number of ways Kay can paint her five fingernails using at least three different colors, with the constraint that no two consecutive fingernails have the same color. We will use the principle of inclusion-exclusion to find the solution.\n\n### Step 1: Total number of ways to paint the fingernails without any restrictions\nFirst, we calculate the total number of ways to paint the five fingernails using \\( T+1 \\) colors without any restrictions. Each fingernail can be painted in \\( T+1 \\) ways, so the total number of ways is:\n\\[\n(T+1)^5\n\\]\n\n### Step 2: Subtract the number of ways where fewer than three colors are used\nNext, we need to subtract the number of ways where fewer than three colors are used. We will consider the cases where only one color and where only two colors are used.\n\n#### Case 1: Using only one color\nIf only one color is used, all five fingernails must be painted the same color. There are \\( T+1 \\) ways to choose this color. Therefore, the number of ways to paint the fingernails using only one color is:\n\\[\n(T+1)\n\\]\n\n#### Case 2: Using exactly two colors\nIf exactly two colors are used, we need to choose 2 colors out of \\( T+1 \\) and then arrange them such that no two consecutive fingernails have the same color. The number of ways to choose 2 colors is:\n\\[\n\\binom{T+1}{2}\n\\]\nFor each pair of colors, we need to count the number of valid sequences of length 5 where no two consecutive elements are the same. This is a classic problem of counting binary sequences with no consecutive 1s or 0s. The number of such sequences of length 5 is given by the 5th Fibonacci number, \\( F_5 \\), which is 8. Therefore, the number of ways to paint the fingernails using exactly two colors is:\n\\[\n\\binom{T+1}{2} \\times 8\n\\]\n\n### Step 3: Apply the principle of inclusion-exclusion\nNow, we use the principle of inclusion-exclusion to find the number of ways to paint the fingernails using at least three colors:\n\\[\n(T+1)^5 - (T+1) - \\binom{T+1}{2} \\times 8\n\\]\n\n### Step 4: Simplify the expression\nFirst, calculate \\( \\binom{T+1}{2} \\):\n\\[\n\\binom{T+1}{2} = \\frac{(T+1)T}{2}\n\\]\nThen, substitute this into the expression:\n\\[\n(T+1)^5 - (T+1) - \\frac{(T+1)T}{2} \\times 8\n\\]\nSimplify the term involving the binomial coefficient:\n\\[\n\\frac{(T+1)T}{2} \\times 8 = 4(T+1)T\n\\]\nThus, the expression becomes:\n\\[\n(T+1)^5 - (T+1) - 4(T+1)T\n\\]\nFactor out \\( (T+1) \\):\n\\[\n(T+1) \\left( (T+1)^4 - 1 - 4T \\right)\n\\]\nSimplify the expression inside the parentheses:\n\\[\n(T+1)^4 - 1 - 4T = T^4 + 4T^3 + 6T^2 + 4T + 1 - 1 - 4T = T^4 + 4T^3 + 6T^2\n\\]\nTherefore, the final expression is:\n\\[\n(T+1)(T^4 + 4T^3 + 6T^2)\n\\]\n\n### Final Answer\n\\[\n\\boxed{(T+1)(T^4 + 4T^3 + 6T^2)}\n\\]"], "id": 2857, "generated_answers": ["(T+1)(T^4 + 4T^3 + 6T^2)"], "gold_answer": "109890", "is_correct": false, "answers_correctness": [false]}

If points $R, M$, and $L$ are all lattice points, and $R$ is in Quadrant I, compute the number of possible ordered pairs $(x, y)$ of coordinates for point $R$.", "generated_responses": ["To solve the problem, we need to determine the coordinates of the midpoints \\( R, M, \\) and \\( L \\) of the sides of a square given that the area of the square is 650 and the coordinates of point \\( A \\) are \\( (11, 5) \\).\n\n### Step 1: Determine the side length of the square\nThe area of the square is given by:\n\\[\n\\text{Area} = s^2 = 650\n\\]\nwhere \\( s \\) is the side length of the square. Solving for \\( s \\):\n\\[\ns = \\sqrt{650} = 5\\sqrt{26}\n\\]\n\n### Step 2: Determine the coordinates of the vertices of the square\nLet the vertices of the square be \\( A, B, C, \\) and \\( D \\) in clockwise order. Since \\( A \\) is at \\( (11, 5) \\), we need to find the coordinates of \\( B, C, \\) and \\( D \\).\n\n### Step 3: Use the midpoint formula to find the coordinates of \\( R, M, \\) and \\( L \\)\nThe midpoints \\( R, M, \\) and \\( L \\) are the midpoints of the sides \\( AB, BC, \\) and \\( CD \\) respectively.

This implies that the coordinates of \\( B, C, \\) and \\( D \\) must be such that the midpoints are integers.\n\n### Step 5: Determine the possible coordinates of \\( B, C, \\) and \\( D \\)\nGiven that \\( A = (11, 5) \\) and the side length is \\( 5\\sqrt{26} \\), the coordinates of \\( B, C, \\) and \\( D \\) must be such that the distance between \\( A \\) and \\( B \\) is \\( 5\\sqrt{26} \\). The possible coordinates of \\( B \\) can be found by considering the rotation of \\( A \\) by 90 degrees around the center of the square.\n\n### Step 6: Calculate the number of possible ordered pairs \\((x, y)\\) for \\( R \\)\nSince \\( R \\) is in Quadrant I, both coordinates of \\( R \\) must be positive. We need to count the number of integer solutions for \\( R \\) that satisfy the conditions.\n\nGiven the symmetry and the constraints, we can determine that there are 4 possible ordered pairs \\((x, y)\\) for \\( R \\) in Quadrant I.\n\nThus, the number of possible ordered pairs \\((x, y)\\) of coordinates for point \\( R \\) is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{4}\n\\]"], "id": 2893, "generated_answers": ["4"], "gold_answer": "10", "is_correct": false, "answers_correctness": [false]}

Let's break down the problem step by step.\n\n1. **Identify the total number of diagonals:**\n   A hexagon has 6 vertices. The number of diagonals in a hexagon is given by the formula for the number of diagonals in an \\( n \\)-gon:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{n(n-3)}{2}\n   \\]\n   For a hexagon (\\( n = 6 \\)):\n   \\[\n   \\frac{6(6-3)}{2} = \\frac{6 \\cdot 3}{2} = 9\n   \\]\n   So, there are 9 diagonals in a hexagon.\n\n2. **Total number of colorings:**\n   Each of the 9 diagonals can be either red or blue.

The possible values of \\( 8 + B \\) that are divisible by 9 are 9, 18, 27, etc. Since \\( B \\) is a digit (0 through 9), the only possible value is:\n\\[\n8 + B = 9 \\implies B = 1\n\\]\nThus, \\( N = 117 \\) is divisible by 9. Since \\( N \\) is not divisible by 9, \\( B \\) cannot be 1.\n\n### Step 3: Ensure the product \\( M \\cdot N \\) is divisible by 9\nFor \\( M \\cdot N \\) to be divisible by 9, the sum of the digits of \\( M \\) and \\( N \\) must be divisible by 9. We need to find the values of \\( A \\) and \\( B \\) such that:\n\\[\n(10 + A) + (8 + B) = 18 + A + B\n\\]\nis divisible by 9. We need to maximize \\( A + B \\) while ensuring \\( 18 + A + B \\) is divisible by 9.\n\n### Step 4: Find the maximum value of \\( A + B \\)\nWe need \\( 18 + A + B \\) to be a multiple of 9. The possible values of \\( 18 + A + B \\) that are multiples of 9 are 18, 27, 36, etc. Since \\( A \\) and \\( B \\) are digits (0 through 9), the maximum value of \\( A + B \\) is 18. However, we need to check if \\( A + B = 18 \\) is possible without making \\( M \\) or \\( N \\) divisible by 9.\n\nIf \\( A + B = 18 \\), then:\n\\[\nA + B = 18 \\implies A = 9 \\text{ and } B = 9\n\\]\nHowever, \\( A = 9 \\) and \\( B = 9 \\) would make \\( M = 496 \\) and \\( N = 197 \\), both of which are not divisible by 9. Therefore, \\( A + B = 18 \\) is a valid solution.\n\n### Conclusion\nThe largest possible value of \\( A + B \\) is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{18}\n\\]"], "id": 3088, "generated_answers": ["18"], "gold_answer": "12", "is_correct": false, "answers_correctness": [false]}
