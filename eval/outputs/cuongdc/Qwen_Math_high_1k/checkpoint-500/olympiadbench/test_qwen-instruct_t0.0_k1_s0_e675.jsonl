This means the number must be a fraction where the denominator is a power of 10. Therefore, \\(\\frac{10^t - 1}{c \\cdot m}\\) must be a fraction with a denominator that is a power of 10.\n\n### Step 2: Simplifying the Condition\nFor \\(\\frac{10^t - 1}{c \\cdot m}\\) to be short, \\( c \\cdot m \\) must be a divisor of \\( 10^t - 1 \\).

We need to arrange these divisors in a rectangular table with \\( r \\) rows and \\( c \\) columns such that:\n1. Each cell contains a distinct divisor.\n2. The sum of the divisors in each row is the same.\n3. The sum of the divisors in each column is the same.\n\n### Step 2: Sum of Divisors\nThe sum of all divisors of \\( n \\) is denoted by \\( \\sigma(n) \\). Since the sums of all rows and columns are equal, let \\( S \\) be the common sum of each row and each column. Then:\n\\[ S \\times r = \\sigma(n) \\]\n\\[ S \\times c = \\sigma(n) \\]\n\nThis implies:\n\\[ S = \\frac{\\sigma(n)}{r} = \\frac{\\sigma(n)}{c} \\]\n\n### Step 3: Relationship Between \\( r \\) and \\( c \\)\nSince \\( S \\) must be an integer, \\( \\sigma(n) \\) must be divisible by both \\( r \\) and \\( c \\). Therefore, \\( r \\) and \\( c \\) must be divisors of \\( \\sigma(n) \\).\n\n### Step 4: Number of Divisors\nThe number of divisors of \\( n \\) is \\( k = r \\times c \\). Since \\( r \\) and \\( c \\) are divisors of \\( \\sigma(n) \\), \\( k \\) must be a product of two divisors of \\( \\sigma(n) \\).\n\n### Step 5: Special Case Analysis\nLet's consider the case when \\( n \\) is a perfect square. If \\( n = m^2 \\), then the divisors of \\( n \\) are \\( 1, m, m^2 \\). The sum of the divisors is:\n\\[ \\sigma(m^2) = 1 + m + m^2 \\]\n\nFor \\( n = m^2 \\), the number of divisors \\( k = 3 \\). We need to arrange these divisors in a \\( 1 \\times 3 \\) or \\( 3 \\times 1 \\) table. However, this does not satisfy the condition that the sums of all rows and columns are equal.\n\n### Step 6: General Case\nFor \\( n \\) to satisfy the given conditions, \\( \\sigma(n) \\) must be such that it can be divided into equal sums for both rows and columns. This is possible if \\( n \\) is a product of two distinct primes, say \\( n = p \\times q \\), where \\( p \\) and \\( q \\) are distinct primes.\n\n### Step 7: Verification\nFor \\( n = p \\times q \\):\n- The divisors are \\( 1, p, q, pq \\).\n- The sum of the divisors is \\( \\sigma(n) = 1 + p + q + pq \\).\n\nWe can arrange these divisors in a \\( 2 \\times 2 \\) table:\n\\[\n\\begin{array}{cc}\n1 & pq \\\\\np & q \\\\\n\\end{array}\n\\]\n\nThe sum of each row and each column is:\n\\[ 1 + pq = p + q \\]\n\nThus, the sums are equal.\n\n### Conclusion\nThe positive integers \\( n \\) for which all positive divisors can be put into a rectangular table with equal row and column sums are those that are products of two distinct primes.

This operation reduces the number of heads by 1 if \\(k > 0\\). Since the number of heads is a non-negative integer and decreases by 1 with each operation, it must eventually reach 0.

We will use a combinatorial argument to find this expected value.\n\nConsider the state of the coins as a binary string of length \\(n\\), where each bit represents a coin (0 for tails, 1 for heads).

This is because the process is symmetric with respect to the number of heads and tails.\n\nLet \\(E_k\\) be the expected number of steps to reach all tails from a state with \\(k\\) heads.

Specifically, we can define a rule where \\( A \\) beats \\( B \\) if the sequence \\((a_1, b_1), (a_2, b_2), \\ldots, (a_{100}, b_{100})\\) is lexicographically greater than the sequence \\((b_1, a_1), (b_2, a_2), \\ldots, (b_{100}, a_{100})\\).\n\n### Step 5: Verifying the Conditions\n1. **Relative Order Dependence**: The rule depends only on the relative order of the 200 cards, as it compares the pairs \\((a_i, b_i)\\) and \\((b_i, a_i)\\).\n2. **Condition 2**: If \\( a_i > b_i \\) for all \\( i \\), then \\((a_i, b_i) > (b_i, a_i)\\) for all \\( i \\), making \\( A \\) beat \\( B \\).\n3. **Condition 3**: If \\( A \\) beats \\( B \\) and \\( B \\) beats \\( C \\), then the lexicographic order of the pairs \\((a_i, b_i)\\) and \\((b_i, c_i)\\) ensures that \\( A \\) beats \\( C \\).\n\n### Step 6: Counting the Number of Ways\nThe lexicographic order is unique and satisfies all the given conditions. Therefore, there is only one way to define such a rule.\n\n### Final Answer\n\\[\n\\boxed{1}\n\\]"], "id": 1977, "generated_answers": ["1"], "gold_answer": "100", "is_correct": true, "answers_correctness": [true]}

This means \\( N \\geq 2012 \\).\n\n2. **Player \\( B \\)'s Move:**\n   - On each of player \\( B \\)'s moves, \\( B \\) passes 1 coin from every box to an adjacent box. This means that each box will lose 1 coin and each adjacent box will gain 1 coin.\n\n3. **Player \\( A \\)'s Move:**\n   - On each of player \\( A \\)'s moves, \\( A \\) chooses several coins that were not involved in \\( B \\)'s previous move and are in different boxes. She passes every chosen coin to an adjacent box.\n\n4. **Objective:**\n   - Player \\( A \\) needs to ensure that there is at least 1 coin in each box after every move of hers.\n\n### Analysis:\n\n- To ensure that there is at least 1 coin in each box after every move of \\( A \\), \\( A \\) must be able to counteract the effect of \\( B \\)'s moves and maintain a minimum of 1 coin in each box.\n\n- Consider the worst-case scenario where \\( B \\) moves coins in such a way that the distribution becomes highly uneven. For example, if \\( B \\) moves all coins from one box to its adjacent box, the distribution can become very skewed.\n\n- To counteract this, \\( A \\) needs to have enough coins to redistribute and maintain a minimum of 1 coin in each box. This means \\( A \\) must have enough coins to cover the maximum possible loss due to \\( B \\)'s moves.\n\n### Minimum \\( N \\):\n\n- If \\( B \\) moves all coins from one box to its adjacent box, the maximum loss for any box is 1 coin.\n- To ensure that there is at least 1 coin in each box after \\( A \\)'s move, \\( A \\) must have at least 2012 coins initially (one for each box).\n\n- However, to ensure that \\( A \\) can always redistribute the coins and maintain at least 1 coin in each box, \\( A \\) needs to have enough coins to cover the maximum possible loss due to \\( B \\)'s moves. This means \\( A \\) needs to have at least 2012 coins initially.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\n- The minimum number of coins \\( N \\) that enables player \\( A \\) to ensure at least 1 coin in each box after every move of hers, regardless of how \\( B \\) plays and how many moves are made, is \\( N = 2012 \\).\n\nThus, the least \\( N \\) that enables player \\( A \\) to succeed is \\(\\boxed{2012}\\)."], "id": 2153, "generated_answers": ["2012"], "gold_answer": "4022", "is_correct": false, "answers_correctness": [false]}

Define $\\operatorname{chef}_{T}(D)$ to be the set of residents in $T$ who are $D$-chefs. For example, in ARMLville, David is a steak-chef and a pancakes-chef. Further, $\\operatorname{chef}_{\\text {ARMLville }}($ steak $)=\\{$ Sally, David $\\}$.\n\n\nIf $\\operatorname{gr}(T)=\\left|\\operatorname{chef}_{T}(D)\\right|$ for some $D \\in \\operatorname{dish}(T)$, then $T$ is called homogeneous. If $\\operatorname{gr}(T)>\\left|\\operatorname{chef}_{T}(D)\\right|$ for each dish $D \\in \\operatorname{dish}(T)$, then $T$ is called heterogeneous. For example, ARMLton is homogeneous, because $\\operatorname{gr}($ ARMLton $)=2$ and exactly two chefs make pie, but ARMLville is heterogeneous, because even though each dish is only cooked by two chefs, $\\operatorname{gr}($ ARMLville $)=3$.\n\n\nA resident cycle is a sequence of distinct residents $r_{1}, \\ldots, r_{n}$ such that for each $1 \\leq i \\leq n-1$, the residents $r_{i}$ and $r_{i+1}$ know how to make a common dish, residents $r_{n}$ and $r_{1}$ know how to make a common dish, and no other pair of residents $r_{i}$ and $r_{j}, 1 \\leq i, j \\leq n$ know how to make a common dish. Two resident cycles are indistinguishable if they contain the same residents (in any order), and distinguishable otherwise. For example, if $r_{1}, r_{2}, r_{3}, r_{4}$ is a resident cycle, then $r_{2}, r_{1}, r_{4}, r_{3}$ and $r_{3}, r_{2}, r_{1}, r_{4}$ are indistinguishable resident cycles.\nIn terms of $k$ and $d$, find the number of distinguishable resident cycles of length $k$ in $\\mathcal{F}_{d}$.", "generated_responses": ["To solve the problem, we need to determine the number of distinguishable resident cycles of length \\( k \\) in a full town \\(\\mathcal{F}_d\\), where \\( d \\) is the number of dishes and \\( k \\) is the group number of the town.\n\n### Step-by-Step Solution:\n\n1. **Understanding the Full Town \\(\\mathcal{F}_d\\)**:\n   - A full town \\(\\mathcal{F}_d\\) has \\( d \\) dishes.\n   - Each resident knows exactly 2 dishes.\n   - No two residents know the same pair of dishes.\n\n2. **Group Number \\(\\operatorname{gr}(\\mathcal{F}_d)\\)**:\n   - The group number \\(\\operatorname{gr}(\\mathcal{F}_d)\\) is the minimum number of groups needed such that no two residents who know a common dish are in the same group.\n   - Since each resident knows 2 dishes and no two residents know the same pair, the group number \\(\\operatorname{gr}(\\mathcal{F}_d)\\) is \\( d \\).\n\n3. **Resident Cycles**:\n   - A resident cycle of length \\( k \\) is a sequence of \\( k \\) distinct residents \\( r_1, r_2, \\ldots, r_k \\) such that:\n     - \\( r_i \\) and \\( r_{i+1} \\) know a common dish for \\( 1 \\leq i \\leq k-1 \\).\n     - \\( r_k \\) and \\( r_1 \\) know a common dish.\n     - No other pair of residents \\( r_i \\) and \\( r_j \\) know a common dish.\n\n4. **Counting Distinguishable Resident Cycles**:\n   - Each resident in \\(\\mathcal{F}_d\\) knows exactly 2 dishes.\n   - Since \\(\\operatorname{gr}(\\mathcal{F}_d) = d\\), each dish is known by exactly 2 residents.\n   - To form a resident cycle of length \\( k \\), we need to select \\( k \\) residents such that each pair of consecutive residents in the cycle shares a common dish.\n\n5. **Constructing the Cycle**:\n   - Start with any resident \\( r_1 \\).\n   - Choose a dish \\( D_1 \\) that \\( r_1 \\) knows.\n   - Choose a resident \\( r_2 \\) who knows \\( D_1 \\) and a different dish \\( D_2 \\).\n   - Continue this process, ensuring that each pair of consecutive residents shares a common dish and no other pair shares a common dish.\n\n6. **Counting the Cycles**:\n   - There are \\( d \\) choices for the first dish \\( D_1 \\).\n   - For each choice of \\( D_1 \\), there are \\( d-1 \\) choices for the next dish \\( D_2 \\) (since \\( D_2 \\) must be different from \\( D_1 \\)).\n   - This process continues until we have chosen \\( k \\) dishes, and the last dish must match the first dish to form a cycle.\n\n7. **Final Calculation**:\n   - The number of ways to choose \\( k \\) dishes in a cycle is \\( d \\times (d-1) \\times (d-2) \\times \\cdots \\times (d-k+1) \\).\n   - However, since the cycle is indistinguishable if it is rotated, we divide by \\( k \\) to account for the rotations.\n\nThus, the number of distinguishable resident cycles of length \\( k \\) in \\(\\mathcal{F}_d\\) is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{\\frac{d \\times (d-1) \\times (d-2) \\times \\cdots \\times (d-k+1)}{k}}\n\\]"], "id": 2626, "generated_answers": ["\\frac{d \\times (d-1) \\times (d-2) \\times \\cdots \\times (d-k+1)}{k}"], "gold_answer": "$\\frac{d !}{2 k(d-k) !}$", "is_correct": false, "answers_correctness": [false]}

{"question": "In ARMLopolis, every house number is a positive integer, and City Hall's address is 0.

However, in a sequence of 7 consecutive integers, there can be at most one prime number (since the sequence spans 7 numbers, and primes are not common in such a small range).\n\n- **Carmichael Numbers**: Carmichael numbers are composite numbers that are relatively prime to all integers less than themselves.

Let's denote the base-2 representation of \\( d \\) as \\( d_2 \\) and the base-5 representation of \\( d \\) as \\( d_5 \\).\n\n### Step 4: Finding \\( d \\)\nWe need to find \\( d \\) such that:\n\\[ d_2 \\equiv d_5 \\pmod{10000} \\]\n\n### Step 5: Simplifying the Problem\nSince \\( d \\) is a 4-digit number, we can directly check each 4-digit number to see if it satisfies the condition. However, this is computationally intensive. Instead, we can use a more systematic approach by considering the properties of base-2 and base-5.\n\n### Step 6: Using Number Theory\nWe need to find \\( d \\) such that:\n\\[ d \\equiv d \\pmod{10000} \\]\nThis is always true, so we need to find \\( d \\) such that:\n\\[ d \\equiv d \\pmod{10000} \\]\n\n### Step 7: Summing the Elements of \\(\\mathcal{S}\\)\nThe set \\(\\mathcal{S}\\) consists of all integers \\( n \\) from 0 to 9999 whose last four digits in base-2 and base-5 are the same. We need to sum these integers.\n\n### Step 8: Calculating the Sum\nThe sum of all integers from 0 to 9999 is:\n\\[ \\sum_{n=0}^{9999} n = \\frac{9999 \\cdot 10000}{2} = 49995000 \\]\n\n### Step 9: Finding the Remainder\nWe need to find the remainder when 49995000 is divided by 10,000:\n\\[ 49995000 \\div 10000 = 4999 \\text{ remainder } 5000 \\]\n\nThus, the remainder is:\n\\[ 49995000 \\mod 10000 = 5000 \\]\n\n### Final Answer\nThe remainder when the sum of the elements of \\(\\mathcal{S}\\) is divided by 10,000 is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{5000}\n\\]"], "id": 2921, "generated_answers": ["5000"], "gold_answer": "6248", "is_correct": false, "answers_correctness": [false]}

Since \\(A\\) and \\(R\\) are positive integers, we need to find pairs \\((A, R)\\) that satisfy this equation.\n\n- If \\(A = 1\\), then \\(1^2 + R^2 = 20 \\implies 1 + R^2 = 20 \\implies R^2 = 19\\). Since 19 is not a perfect square, \\(A = 1\\) is not a solution.\n- If \\(A = 2\\), then \\(2^2 + R^2 = 20 \\implies 4 + R^2 = 20 \\implies R^2 = 16 \\implies R = 4\\). So, \\((A, R) = (2, 4)\\) is a solution.\n- If \\(A = 3\\), then \\(3^2 + R^2 = 20 \\implies 9 + R^2 = 20 \\implies R^2 = 11\\). Since 11 is not a perfect square, \\(A = 3\\) is not a solution.\n- If \\(A = 4\\), then \\(4^2 + R^2 = 20 \\implies 16 + R^2 = 20 \\implies R^2 = 4 \\implies R = 2\\). So, \\((A, R) = (4, 2)\\) is a solution.\n- If \\(A = 5\\), then \\(5^2 + R^2 = 20 \\implies 25 + R^2 = 20 \\implies R^2 = -5\\). Since \\(-5\\) is not a perfect square, \\(A = 5\\) is not a solution.\n\nThus, the possible pairs \\((A, R)\\) are \\((2, 4)\\) and \\((4, 2)\\).\n\n### Step 2: Solve for \\(M\\) and \\(L\\)\nNext, we solve the equation \\(M^2 + L^2 = 10\\). Since \\(M\\) and \\(L\\) are positive integers, we need to find pairs \\((M, L)\\) that satisfy this equation.\n\n- If \\(M = 1\\), then \\(1^2 + L^2 = 10 \\implies 1 + L^2 = 10 \\implies L^2 = 9 \\implies L = 3\\). So, \\((M, L) = (1, 3)\\) is a solution.\n- If \\(M = 2\\), then \\(2^2 + L^2 = 10 \\implies 4 + L^2 = 10 \\implies L^2 = 6\\). Since 6 is not a perfect square, \\(M = 2\\) is not a solution.\n- If \\(M = 3\\), then \\(3^2 + L^2 = 10 \\implies 9 + L^2 = 10 \\implies L^2 = 1 \\implies L = 1\\). So, \\((M, L) = (3, 1)\\) is a solution.\n- If \\(M = 4\\), then \\(4^2 + L^2 = 10 \\implies 16 + L^2 = 10 \\implies L^2 = -6\\). Since \\(-6\\) is not a perfect square, \\(M = 4\\) is not a solution.\n\nThus, the possible pairs \\((M, L)\\) are \\((1, 3)\\) and \\((3, 1)\\).\n\n### Step 3: Compute the product \\(A \\cdot R \\cdot M \\cdot L\\)\nWe now have the possible pairs \\((A, R)\\) and \\((M, L)\\). We need to compute the product \\(A \\cdot R \\cdot M \\cdot L\\) for each combination of these pairs.\n\n- For \\((A, R) = (2, 4)\\) and \\((M, L) = (1, 3)\\):\n  \\[\n  A \\cdot R \\cdot M \\cdot L = 2 \\cdot 4 \\cdot 1 \\cdot 3 = 24\n  \\]\n- For \\((A, R) = (2, 4)\\) and \\((M, L) = (3, 1)\\):\n  \\[\n  A \\cdot R \\cdot M \\cdot L = 2 \\cdot 4 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 1 = 24\n  \\]\n- For \\((A, R) = (4, 2)\\) and \\((M, L) = (1, 3)\\):\n  \\[\n  A \\cdot R \\cdot M \\cdot L = 4 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 1 \\cdot 3 = 24\n  \\]\n- For \\((A, R) = (4, 2)\\) and \\((M, L) = (3, 1)\\):\n  \\[\n  A \\cdot R \\cdot M \\cdot L = 4 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 1 = 24\n  \\]\n\nIn all cases, the product \\(A \\cdot R \\cdot M \\cdot L\\) is 24.\n\nThus, the final answer is \\(\\boxed{24}\\)."], "id": 2922, "generated_answers": ["24"], "gold_answer": "24", "is_correct": true, "answers_correctness": [true]}

Compute the number of noncongruent triangles that can be formed in this manner.", "generated_responses": ["To solve the problem of finding the number of noncongruent triangles that can be formed by extending three sides of a regular 16-gon, we need to follow a systematic approach. Let's break it down step by step.\n\n### Step 1: Understanding the Problem\nA regular 16-gon has 16 vertices and 16 sides. We need to extend three of its sides to form a triangle such that none of the vertices of the triangle lie on the 16-gon itself.\n\n### Step 2: Identifying the Vertices of the Triangle\nTo form a triangle, we need to choose three vertices from the 16-gon. However, since the sides of the triangle are extensions of the sides of the 16-gon, the vertices of the triangle must be such that they are not adjacent to each other in the 16-gon.\n\n### Step 3: Counting the Number of Ways to Choose the Vertices\nWe need to choose three vertices from the 16-gon such that no two vertices are adjacent. This is equivalent to choosing three vertices from a set of 16 vertices with the condition that no two chosen vertices are consecutive.\n\n### Step 4: Using Combinatorial Methods\nTo count the number of ways to choose three non-adjacent vertices from 16 vertices, we can use the concept of \"gaps\" between the chosen vertices. If we choose three vertices, there will be 13 remaining vertices, and we need to place these 13 vertices in the gaps between the chosen vertices.\n\n### Step 5: Calculating the Number of Gaps\nWe can represent the 16 vertices as a circle. When we choose three vertices, we create 3 gaps between them. We need to place the remaining 13 vertices in these 3 gaps such that no gap is empty (since no two chosen vertices are adjacent).\n\n### Step 6: Using the Stars and Bars Method\nThe problem of distributing 13 vertices into 3 gaps can be solved using the stars and bars method. The number of ways to distribute \\( n \\) indistinguishable objects into \\( k \\) distinguishable bins is given by:\n\\[\n\\binom{n + k - 1}{k - 1}\n\\]\nIn our case, \\( n = 13 \\) and \\( k = 3 \\):\n\\[\n\\binom{13 + 3 - 1}{3 - 1} = \\binom{15}{2}\n\\]\n\n### Step 7: Calculating the Binomial Coefficient\n\\[\n\\binom{15}{2} = \\frac{15 \\times 14}{2 \\times 1} = 105\n\\]\n\n### Step 8: Considering Symmetry\nSince the 16-gon is regular, any triangle formed by extending three sides will be congruent to any other triangle formed by extending three sides. Therefore, we do not need to consider different orientations or rotations of the same triangle.\n\n### Final Answer\nThe number of noncongruent triangles that can be formed by extending three sides of a regular 16-gon is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{105}\n\\]"], "id": 3086, "generated_answers": ["105"], "gold_answer": "11", "is_correct": false, "answers_correctness": [false]}

Let's break this down step by step.\n\n1. **Sum of the interior angles of a pentagon:**\n   A pentagon has 5 sides, so:\n   \\[\n   (5-2) \\times 180^\\circ = 3 \\times 180^\\circ = 540^\\circ\n   \\]\n\n2. **Sum of the interior angles of an octagon:**\n   An octagon has 8 sides, so:\n   \\[\n   (8-2) \\times 180^\\circ = 6 \\times 180^\\circ = 1080^\\circ\n   \\]\n\n3. **Sum of the interior angles of the \\( n \\)-gon:**\n   According to the problem, this sum is equal to the sum of the interior angles of the pentagon and the octagon:\n   \\[\n   (n-2) \\times 180^\\circ = 540^\\circ + 1080^\\circ\n   \\]\n\n4. **Solve for \\( n \\):**\n   \\[\n   (n-2) \\times 180^\\circ = 1620^\\circ\n   \\]\n   Divide both sides by 180:\n   \\[\n   n-2 = \\frac{1620^\\circ}{180^\\circ} = 9\n   \\]\n   Add 2 to both sides:\n   \\[\n   n = 9 + 2 = 11\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, the value of \\( n \\) is \\(\\boxed{11}\\)."], "id": 3102, "generated_answers": ["11"], "gold_answer": "11", "is_correct": true, "answers_correctness": [true]}
