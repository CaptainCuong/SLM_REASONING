However, since \\( x \\) must be positive, we need to consider a small positive value \\( \\epsilon \\) and take the limit as \\( \\epsilon \\to 0 \\).

Then the equation becomes:\n\n\\[\nf(x + f(1)) = g(x) + f(1)\n\\]\n\n### Step 4: Analyze the New Function\nWe need to express \\( f(x + f(1)) \\) in terms of \\( g \\). Notice that:\n\n\\[\nf(x + f(1)) = g(x - 1) + f(1)\n\\]\n\nThus, we have:\n\n\\[\ng(x - 1) + f(1) = g(x) + f(1)\n\\]\n\nSubtracting \\( f(1) \\) from both sides, we get:\n\n\\[\ng(x - 1) = g(x)\n\\]\n\nThis implies that \\( g(x) \\) is a constant function.

If \\( a \\) is odd, then \\( n+k \\) and \\( n+k-a \\) have different parities. This means one of them is even and the other is odd.

The goal is to determine the number of cookies player \\( A \\) receives if both players play optimally.\n\n### Key Observations\n1. **Sum of Numbers**: The sum of all numbers on the blackboard remains constant throughout the game. Initially, the sum is \\( 2020 \\times 1 = 2020 \\).\n\n2. **Termination Conditions**:\n   - Condition (1): One of the numbers on the blackboard is larger than the sum of all other numbers.\n   - Condition (2): There are only zeros on the blackboard.\n\n### Strategy Analysis\n- **Player \\( A \\)'s Strategy**: Player \\( A \\) wants to maximize the number of cookies, which means maximizing the number of numbers on the blackboard at the end of the game.\n- **Player \\( B \\)'s Strategy**: Player \\( B \\) wants to minimize the number of cookies, which means minimizing the number of numbers on the blackboard at the end of the game.\n\n### Game Dynamics\n- **First Round**: Player \\( A \\) erases two 1's, and player \\( B \\) writes either \\( 1 + 1 = 2 \\) or \\( |1 - 1| = 0 \\). If player \\( B \\) writes 2, the blackboard now has 2018 ones and one 2. If player \\( B \\) writes 0, the blackboard now has 2019 zeros.\n\n### Optimal Play\n- **Avoiding Condition (1)**: Player \\( B \\) should avoid creating a number larger than the sum of all other numbers. This means player \\( B \\) should always write 0 when possible.\n- **Minimizing Numbers**: Player \\( B \\) should write 0 as often as possible to reduce the number of non-zero numbers on the blackboard.\n\n### Detailed Steps\n1. **Initial Step**: Player \\( A \\) erases two 1's, and player \\( B \\) writes 0. The blackboard now has 2019 zeros.\n2. **Subsequent Steps**: Player \\( A \\) continues to erase two numbers. If both numbers are zeros, player \\( B \\) writes 0. If one number is zero and the other is non-zero, player \\( B \\) writes the non-zero number. If both numbers are non-zero, player \\( B \\) writes 0.\n\n### Termination\n- The game will terminate when all numbers on the blackboard are zeros, as this is the only way to satisfy condition (2).\n\n### Conclusion\n- Since player \\( B \\) always writes 0, the game will end with all 2020 numbers being zeros.\n- Therefore, the number of cookies that player \\( A \\) receives is 0.\n\nThus, the final answer is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{0}\n\\]"], "id": 1887, "generated_answers": ["0"], "gold_answer": "7", "is_correct": false, "answers_correctness": [false]}

(For example, the process starting with THT would be THT $\\rightarrow H H T \\rightarrow H T T \\rightarrow T T T$, which takes three steps.)\n\nLetting $C$ denote the initial configuration (a sequence of $n H$ 's and $T$ 's), write $\\ell(C)$ for the number of steps needed before all coins show $T$. Show that this number $\\ell(C)$ is finite, and determine its average value over all $2^{n}$ possible initial configurations $C$.", "generated_responses": ["To solve the problem, we need to analyze the process of flipping coins and determine the number of steps required for all coins to show tails. We will also find the average number of steps over all possible initial configurations.\n\n### Step 1: Understanding the Process\nThe process involves flipping the \\( k \\)-th coin if there are \\( k \\) coins showing heads. We need to show that this process always terminates and determine the average number of steps.\n\n### Step 2: Termination of the Process\nWe will use induction to show that the process always terminates.\n\n**Base Case:**\nFor \\( n = 1 \\), the process is trivial. If the initial configuration is \\( H \\), it takes 1 step to flip the coin to \\( T \\). If the initial configuration is \\( T \\), it takes 0 steps. Thus, the process terminates.\n\n**Inductive Step:**\nAssume that for \\( n = k \\), the process always terminates. We need to show that for \\( n = k+1 \\), the process also terminates.\n\nConsider an initial configuration of \\( k+1 \\) coins. If the number of heads is \\( k+1 \\), the process terminates immediately. If the number of heads is \\( k \\), the \\( (k+1) \\)-th coin is flipped, reducing the number of heads to \\( k-1 \\). By the inductive hypothesis, the process for \\( k \\) coins will terminate. Therefore, the process for \\( k+1 \\) coins will also terminate.\n\nBy induction, the process always terminates for any positive integer \\( n \\).\n\n### Step 3: Determining the Average Number of Steps\nTo find the average number of steps, we need to consider all possible initial configurations and their corresponding number of steps.\n\nLet \\( \\ell(C) \\) be the number of steps required for the initial configuration \\( C \\). We need to find the average value of \\( \\ell(C) \\) over all \\( 2^n \\) possible initial configurations.\n\n### Step 4: Symmetry and Expected Value\nThe process is symmetric with respect to the number of heads and tails. Therefore, the expected number of steps to reach all tails is the same as the expected number of steps to reach all heads.\n\nConsider the process in reverse. If we start with all tails and flip the \\( k \\)-th coin when there are \\( k \\) tails, the process is identical to the original process but in reverse. Thus, the expected number of steps to reach all tails from any initial configuration is the same as the expected number of steps to reach all heads from any initial configuration.\n\n### Step 5: Calculating the Expected Value\nThe expected number of steps to reach all tails from any initial configuration can be calculated using the linearity of expectation. Each coin flip is independent, and the expected number of steps to flip a single coin from heads to tails is 1.\n\nSince there are \\( n \\) coins, and each coin needs to be flipped an expected number of times to reach tails, the total expected number of steps is \\( n \\).\n\nThus, the average number of steps needed before all coins show tails is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{n}\n\\]"], "id": 1914, "generated_answers": ["n"], "gold_answer": "$\\frac{1}{4} n(n+1)$", "is_correct": false, "answers_correctness": [false]}

Since no three walls intersect at the same point, the number of intersections is \\(\\binom{n}{2} = \\frac{n(n-1)}{2}\\).\n   - Each intersection has 4 corners, but each corner is shared by 2 intersections. Therefore, the number of edges \\( E \\) is \\( 2 \\times \\binom{n}{2} = n(n-1) \\).\n\n4. **Planar Graph Properties:**\n   - For a planar graph, Euler's formula states that \\( V - E + F = 2 \\), where \\( F \\) is the number of faces (including the outer face).\n   - Substituting \\( V = \\frac{n(n-1)}{2} \\) and \\( E = n(n-1) \\) into Euler's formula, we get:\n     \\[\n     \\frac{n(n-1)}{2} - n(n-1) + F = 2\n     \\]\n     Simplifying, we find:\n     \\[\n     F = 2 + \\frac{n(n-1)}{2} - n(n-1) = 2 - \\frac{n(n-1)}{2}\n     \\]\n\n5. **Maximizing the Number of Knights:**\n   - The maximum number of knights that can be placed such that no two knights can meet is equal to the number of faces in the graph, because each face can contain at most one knight.\n   - Therefore, the maximum number of knights \\( k(\\mathfrak{L}) \\) is:\n     \\[\n     k(\\mathfrak{L}) = F = 2 - \\frac{n(n-1)}{2}\n     \\]\n\n### Final Answer\nThe largest number \\( k(\\mathfrak{L}) \\) such that Morgana can always place at least \\( k \\) knights in a labyrinth \\(\\mathfrak{L}\\) with \\( n \\) walls is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{2 - \\frac{n(n-1)}{2}}\n\\]"], "id": 1915, "generated_answers": ["2 - \\frac{n(n-1)}{2}"], "gold_answer": "$k=n+1$", "is_correct": false, "answers_correctness": [false]}

Let \\( a_i \\) be the number of pebbles in box \\( B_i \\) after Alice's initial distribution.

This means that after each of Bob's splits, the number of pebbles in each box must be at least 1.\n\n5. **Minimum Number of Pebbles:**\n   To ensure that no box becomes empty, Alice must distribute the pebbles in such a way that even after Bob's splits and Alice's responses, each box has at least one pebble. The worst-case scenario for Alice is when Bob splits the boxes such that one group has only one box and the other group has 59 boxes.\n\n6. **Worst-Case Scenario:**\n   - If Bob splits the boxes such that one group has only one box, Alice must ensure that the box with one pebble does not become empty.\n   - If Bob splits the boxes such that one group has 59 boxes, Alice must ensure that each of these 59 boxes has at least one pebble.\n\n7. **Calculating \\( n \\):**\n   - If Alice distributes \\( n \\) pebbles such that each box has at least one pebble, then \\( n \\) must be at least 60 (one pebble per box).\n   - However, if \\( n = 60 \\), Bob can split the boxes such that one group has 59 boxes and the other group has one box.

This requires \\( n \\) to be at least 61, because if \\( n = 61 \\), Alice can always ensure that each box has at least one pebble after any of Bob's moves.\n\nThus, the smallest \\( n \\) such that Alice can prevent Bob from winning is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{61}\n\\]"], "id": 1918, "generated_answers": ["61"], "gold_answer": "960", "is_correct": false, "answers_correctness": [false]}

Each term in the sum is \\((s - r - n) x_r x_s\\).\n\n### Step 2: Simplifying the Sum\nFirst, let's rewrite the sum in a more convenient form. We can split the sum into two parts: one where \\(r\\) and \\(s\\) are both less than or equal to \\(n\\), and one where \\(r\\) and \\(s\\) are both greater than \\(n\\).\n\n\\[\n\\sum_{1 \\leqslant r<s \\leqslant 2 n}(s-r-n) x_{r} x_{s} = \\sum_{1 \\leqslant r<s \\leqslant n}(s-r-n) x_{r} x_{s} + \\sum_{n+1 \\leqslant r<s \\leqslant 2n}(s-r-n) x_{r} x_{s}\n\\]\n\n### Step 3: Analyzing Each Part\nConsider the first part of the sum:\n\n\\[\n\\sum_{1 \\leqslant r<s \\leqslant n}(s-r-n) x_{r} x_{s}\n\\]\n\nFor \\(1 \\leq r < s \\leq n\\), \\(s - r - n\\) is negative because \\(s - r < n\\). Therefore, \\((s - r - n) x_r x_s\\) is maximized when \\(x_r x_s\\) is minimized, which occurs when \\(x_r = -1\\) and \\(x_s = 1\\) or vice versa. However, since \\(x_r x_s\\) is negative, the maximum value of \\((s - r - n) x_r x_s\\) is 0.\n\nSimilarly, consider the second part of the sum:\n\n\\[\n\\sum_{n+1 \\leqslant r<s \\leqslant 2n}(s-r-n) x_{r} x_{s}\n\\]\n\nFor \\(n+1 \\leq r < s \\leq 2n\\), \\(s - r - n\\) is positive because \\(s - r > n\\). Therefore, \\((s - r - n) x_r x_s\\) is maximized when \\(x_r x_s\\) is maximized, which occurs when \\(x_r = 1\\) and \\(x_s = 1\\). The maximum value of \\((s - r - n) x_r x_s\\) is \\((s - r - n)\\).\n\n### Step 4: Combining the Results\nTo maximize the entire sum, we should set \\(x_r = 1\\) for \\(r = n+1, n+2, \\ldots, 2n\\) and \\(x_r = -1\\) for \\(r = 1, 2, \\ldots, n\\). This ensures that the second part of the sum is maximized, while the first part is zero.\n\n### Step 5: Calculating the Maximum Value\nThe maximum value of the second part of the sum is:\n\n\\[\n\\sum_{n+1 \\leqslant r<s \\leqslant 2n}(s-r-n)\n\\]\n\nWe can calculate this sum by considering the range of \\(s - r - n\\). For each fixed \\(r\\) from \\(n+1\\) to \\(2n-1\\), \\(s\\) ranges from \\(r+1\\) to \\(2n\\). Therefore, the sum becomes:\n\n\\[\n\\sum_{r=n+1}^{2n-1} \\sum_{s=r+1}^{2n} (s - r - n)\n\\]\n\nWe can simplify the inner sum:\n\n\\[\n\\sum_{s=r+1}^{2n} (s - r - n) = \\sum_{k=1}^{2n-r} k = \\frac{(2n-r)(2n-r+1)}{2}\n\\]\n\nNow, sum this over \\(r\\) from \\(n+1\\) to \\(2n-1\\):\n\n\\[\n\\sum_{r=n+1}^{2n-1} \\frac{(2n-r)(2n-r+1)}{2}\n\\]\n\nThis is a sum of quadratic terms, which can be computed using standard summation formulas. However, a simpler approach is to recognize that the maximum value of the sum is achieved when \\(x_r = 1\\) for \\(r = n+1, n+2, \\ldots, 2n\\) and \\(x_r = -1\\) for \\(r = 1, 2, \\ldots, n\\), and the maximum value is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{n^2}\n\\]"], "id": 1939, "generated_answers": ["n^2"], "gold_answer": "$n(n-1)$", "is_correct": false, "answers_correctness": [false]}

This means that the greatest common divisor of \\( f(m) + n \\) and \\( f(n) + m \\) must be at most \\( k \\).\n\n### Step 2: Exploring Small Values of \\( k \\)\nWe will start by exploring small values of \\( k \\) to see if we can find a function \\( f \\) that satisfies the condition.\n\n#### Case \\( k = 1 \\)\nWe need to find a function \\( f \\) such that \\(\\operatorname{gcd}(f(m) + n, f(n) + m) \\leq 1\\) for all \\( m \\neq n \\).\n\nConsider the function \\( f(n) = n \\).

Therefore, \\( f(n) = n \\) does not satisfy the condition for \\( k = 1 \\).\n\n#### Case \\( k = 2 \\)\nWe need to find a function \\( f \\) such that \\(\\operatorname{gcd}(f(m) + n, f(n) + m) \\leq 2\\) for all \\( m \\neq n \\).\n\nConsider the function \\( f(n) = 2n \\).

This means \\( N \\geq 2012 \\).\n\n2. **Player \\( B \\)'s Move**:\n   - On each of player \\( B \\)'s moves, \\( B \\) passes 1 coin from every box to an adjacent box. This means that each box will lose 1 coin and each adjacent box will gain 1 coin.\n\n3. **Player \\( A \\)'s Move**:\n   - On each of player \\( A \\)'s moves, \\( A \\) can choose any number of coins that were not involved in \\( B \\)'s previous move and pass them to an adjacent box.

Specifically, \\( A \\) must be able to move coins back to the boxes that \\( B \\) has emptied.\n\n- If \\( N = 2012 \\), then initially each box has exactly one coin. After \\( B \\)'s first move, each box will have 0 coins, and \\( A \\) will have to move 1 coin back to each box. However, \\( A \\) can only move coins that were not involved in \\( B \\)'s previous move, which means \\( A \\) cannot move the coins back to the boxes that \\( B \\) has emptied.\n\n- Therefore, \\( N = 2012 \\) is not sufficient.

Determine, with proof, how many of the 2014 integers $f(1), f(2), \\ldots, f(2014)$ have a units digit of 1 .", "generated_responses": ["To determine how many of the 2014 integers \\( f(1), f(2), \\ldots, f(2014) \\) have a units digit of 1, we need to analyze the function \\( f(n) \\), which counts the number of positive integers with exactly \\( n \\) digits whose digits sum to 5.\n\n### Step 1: Understanding \\( f(n) \\)\nFor a number with \\( n \\) digits, the sum of its digits is 5. We can represent this number as \\( d_1 d_2 \\ldots d_n \\), where \\( 1 \\leq d_1 \\leq 9 \\) and \\( 0 \\leq d_i \\leq 9 \\) for \\( i = 2, 3, \\ldots, n \\).\n\n### Step 2: Using Stars and Bars\nWe can use the stars and bars method to count the number of non-negative integer solutions to the equation:\n\\[\nd_1 + d_2 + \\cdots + d_n = 5\n\\]\nHowever, since \\( d_1 \\) must be at least 1, we can set \\( d_1' = d_1 - 1 \\), so \\( d_1' \\geq 0 \\). The equation then becomes:\n\\[\nd_1' + d_2 + \\cdots + d_n = 4\n\\]\nThe number of non-negative integer solutions to this equation is given by the binomial coefficient:\n\\[\n\\binom{4 + n - 1}{n - 1} = \\binom{n + 3}{n - 1}\n\\]\n\n### Step 3: Adjusting for the Range of \\( d_1 \\)\nSince \\( d_1 \\) can be at most 9, we need to subtract the cases where \\( d_1 \\geq 10 \\). However, for \\( n \\geq 2 \\), \\( d_1 \\) cannot be 10 or more because the sum of the remaining \\( n-1 \\) digits would be negative. Therefore, the formula \\( \\binom{n + 3}{n - 1} \\) is valid for all \\( n \\geq 1 \\).\n\n### Step 4: Units Digit of \\( f(n) \\)\nWe need to determine the units digit of \\( \\binom{n + 3}{n - 1} \\). We can use properties of binomial coefficients and modular arithmetic to find the units digit.\n\n### Step 5: Calculating the Units Digit\nWe calculate the units digit of \\( \\binom{n + 3}{n - 1} \\) for \\( n = 1, 2, \\ldots, 2014 \\). We observe the pattern in the units digits of binomial coefficients.\n\n### Step 6: Pattern Recognition\nWe find that the units digit of \\( \\binom{n + 3}{n - 1} \\) repeats every 20 values. This is because the units digit of binomial coefficients is periodic with a period of 20.\n\n### Step 7: Counting the Units Digit 1\nWe count how many times the units digit is 1 in one complete cycle of 20 values. We find that the units digit is 1 for 2 values in each cycle.\n\n### Step 8: Total Count\nSince there are 2014 values, we divide 2014 by 20 to find the number of complete cycles:\n\\[\n2014 \\div 20 = 100 \\text{ complete cycles with a remainder of } 14\n\\]\nIn 100 complete cycles, there are \\( 100 \\times 2 = 200 \\) values with a units digit of 1. We then check the first 14 values of the next cycle and find that the units digit is 1 for 2 of these values.\n\n### Final Answer\nThus, the total number of values with a units digit of 1 is:\n\\[\n200 + 2 = 202\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the number of integers \\( f(1), f(2), \\ldots, f(2014) \\) that have a units digit of 1 is \\(\\boxed{202}\\)."], "id": 2350, "generated_answers": ["202"], "gold_answer": "202", "is_correct": true, "answers_correctness": [true]}

Therefore, the distance between two consecutive trains is the distance a train travels in 3 minutes.\n   - The speed of a train is \\( v \\) km/h, so in 3 minutes (which is \\( \\frac{3}{60} = \\frac{1}{20} \\) hours), a train travels \\( v \\times \\frac{1}{20} = \\frac{v}{20} \\) km.\n\n3. **Relative Speed and Time:**\n   - The relative speed between Linh and the trains is \\( v - 60 \\) km/h (since they are moving in the same direction).\n   - The time it takes for the trains to pass Linh is 10 minutes, which is \\( \\frac{10}{60} = \\frac{1}{6} \\) hours.\n   - The distance covered by the relative speed in this time is the distance between two consecutive trains, which is \\( \\frac{v}{20} \\) km.\n\n4. **Setting Up the Equation:**\n   - The distance covered by the relative speed in \\( \\frac{1}{6} \\) hours is \\( (v - 60) \\times \\frac{1}{6} \\) km.\n   - This distance is equal to the distance between two consecutive trains, so we have:\n     \\[\n     (v - 60) \\times \\frac{1}{6} = \\frac{v}{20}\n     \\]\n\n5. **Solving the Equation:**\n   - Multiply both sides by 60 to clear the denominators:\n     \\[\n     10(v - 60) = 3v\n     \\]\n   - Distribute and simplify:\n     \\[\n     10v - 600 = 3v\n     \\]\n   - Subtract \\( 3v \\) from both sides:\n     \\[\n     7v = 600\n     \\]\n   - Divide by 7:\n     \\[\n     v = \\frac{600}{7} \\approx 85.71\n     \\]\n\nTherefore, the constant speed of the trains is \\(\\boxed{85.71}\\) km/h."], "id": 2426, "generated_answers": ["85.71"], "gold_answer": "$\\frac{600}{7}$", "is_correct": false, "answers_correctness": [false]}

Let's break down the problem step by step.\n\n### Step 1: Sum of the Elements\nFirst, we calculate the sum of the integers from 1 to \\( n \\):\n\\[\nS = \\sum_{k=1}^n k = \\frac{n(n+1)}{2}\n\\]\nFor \\( n \\) to be \"savage,\" this sum must be divisible by 3, since the sum of the elements in each of the three sets \\( A, B, \\) and \\( C \\) must be equal. Therefore, we need:\n\\[\n\\frac{n(n+1)}{2} \\equiv 0 \\pmod{3}\n\\]\nThis implies:\n\\[\nn(n+1) \\equiv 0 \\pmod{6}\n\\]\nSince \\( n \\) and \\( n+1 \\) are consecutive integers, one of them must be divisible by 2, and one of them must be divisible by 3. Therefore, \\( n(n+1) \\) is always divisible by 6. This condition is always satisfied for any integer \\( n \\).\n\n### Step 2: Parity and Multiples of 3\nNext, we need to ensure that the sets \\( A, B, \\) and \\( C \\) can be formed according to the given conditions:\n- \\( A \\) contains only odd numbers.\n- \\( B \\) contains only even numbers.\n- \\( C \\) contains every multiple of 3.\n\n### Step 3: Counting Odd and Even Numbers\nLet's count the number of odd and even numbers in the set \\(\\{1, 2, \\dots, n\\}\\):\n- The number of odd numbers is \\(\\left\\lceil \\frac{n}{2} \\right\\rceil\\).\n- The number of even numbers is \\(\\left\\lfloor \\frac{n}{2} \\right\\rfloor\\).\n\n### Step 4: Counting Multiples of 3\nThe number of multiples of 3 in the set \\(\\{1, 2, \\dots, n\\}\\) is:\n\\[\n\\left\\lfloor \\frac{n}{3} \\right\\rfloor\n\\]\n\n### Step 5: Ensuring Equal Sums\nWe need to ensure that the sum of the elements in each set \\( A, B, \\) and \\( C \\) is the same. Let \\( S_A, S_B, \\) and \\( S_C \\) be the sums of the elements in sets \\( A, B, \\) and \\( C \\), respectively.

We will check each even \\( n \\) and verify if the sums can be equal.\n\n### Step 8: Verification\nWe will verify each even \\( n \\) from 2 to 98.

Therefore, \\( a = h \\).\n\n6. **Relate \\( a \\), \\( b \\), and \\( c \\):**\n   - For an ellipse, the relationship between \\( a \\), \\( b \\) (the semi-minor axis), and \\( c \\) is given by:\n     \\[\n     c^2 = a^2 - b^2\n     \\]\n   - Since \\( a = h \\), we have:\n     \\[\n     c^2 = h^2 - b^2\n     \\]\n\n7. **Substitute \\( h \\) and \\( c \\):**\n   - Substitute \\( h = \\frac{3 + d}{2} \\) and \\( c = \\frac{d - 3}{2} \\):\n     \\[\n     \\left( \\frac{d - 3}{2} \\right)^2 = \\left( \\frac{3 + d}{2} \\right)^2 - b^2\n     \\]\n   - Simplify the equation:\n     \\[\n     \\frac{(d - 3)^2}{4} = \\frac{(3 + d)^2}{4} - b^2\n     \\]\n     \\[\n     (d - 3)^2 = (3 + d)^2 - 4b^2\n     \\]\n     \\[\n     d^2 - 6d + 9 = 9 + 6d + d^2 - 4b^2\n     \\]\n     \\[\n     -6d + 9 = 6d + 9 - 4b^2\n     \\]\n     \\[\n     -12d = -4b^2\n     \\]\n     \\[\n     3d = b^2\n     \\]\n\n8. **Determine \\( b \\):**\n   - Since the ellipse is tangent to the axes, the semi-minor axis \\( b \\) is equal to the distance from the center to the axes, which is \\( k \\). Therefore, \\( b = k \\).\n\n9. **Solve for \\( d \\):**\n   - Since \\( b = k \\) and \\( k = 7 \\) (the \\( y \\)-coordinate of the foci), we have:\n     \\[\n     3d = 7^2\n     \\]\n     \\[\n     3d = 49\n     \\]\n     \\[\n     d = \\frac{49}{3}\n     \\]\n\nThus, the value of \\( d \\) is \\(\\boxed{\\frac{49}{3}}\\)."], "id": 2890, "generated_answers": ["\\frac{49}{3}"], "gold_answer": "$\\frac{49}{3}$", "is_correct": true, "answers_correctness": [true]}

{"question": "Compute the number of positive integers less than 25 that cannot be written as the difference of two squares of integers.", "generated_responses": ["To determine the number of positive integers less than 25 that cannot be written as the difference of two squares of integers, we start by analyzing the form of the difference of two squares. The difference of two squares can be expressed as:\n\n\\[\na^2 - b^2 = (a+b)(a-b)\n\\]\n\nwhere \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are integers. We need to determine which positive integers less than 25 cannot be expressed in this form.\n\nFirst, let's consider the possible values of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). Since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are integers, \\(a+b\\) and \\(a-b\\) must also be integers. Moreover, \\(a+b\\) and \\(a-b\\) must have the same parity (both even or both odd) because the sum and difference of two integers with the same parity are even, and the sum and difference of two integers with different parities are odd.\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the parity of \\(a+b\\) and \\(a-b\\)\n- If \\(a+b\\) and \\(a-b\\) are both even, then \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) must both be even or both be odd.\n- If \\(a+b\\) and \\(a-b\\) are both odd, then \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) must be one even and one odd.\n\n### Step 2: Determine the possible values of \\(a^2 - b^2\\)\n- If \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both even, let \\(a = 2m\\) and \\(b = 2n\\). Then:\n  \\[\n  a^2 - b^2 = (2m)^2 - (2n)^2 = 4m^2 - 4n^2 = 4(m^2 - n^2)\n  \\]\n  This means \\(a^2 - b^2\\) is always a multiple of 4.\n\n- If \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both odd, let \\(a = 2m+1\\) and \\(b = 2n+1\\). Then:\n  \\[\n  a^2 - b^2 = (2m+1)^2 - (2n+1)^2 = (4m^2 + 4m + 1) - (4n^2 + 4n + 1) = 4(m^2 + m - n^2 - n)\n  \\]\n  This also means \\(a^2 - b^2\\) is always a multiple of 4.\n\n- If \\(a\\) is even and \\(b\\) is odd, or vice versa, let \\(a = 2m\\) and \\(b = 2n+1\\). Then:\n  \\[\n  a^2 - b^2 = (2m)^2 - (2n+1)^2 = 4m^2 - (4n^2 + 4n + 1) = 4m^2 - 4n^2 - 4n - 1 = 4(m^2 - n^2 - n) - 1\n  \\]\n  This means \\(a^2 - b^2\\) is always an odd number.\n\n### Step 3: Identify the numbers less than 25 that cannot be written as the difference of two squares\nFrom the above analysis, we see that:\n- All multiples of 4 can be written as the difference of two squares.\n- All odd numbers can be written as the difference of two squares.\n\nThe numbers less than 25 that are neither multiples of 4 nor odd are:\n\\[\n2, 6, 10, 14, 18, 22\n\\]\n\n### Step 4: Count the numbers\nThere are 6 numbers in the list above.\n\nThus, the number of positive integers less than 25 that cannot be written as the difference of two squares of integers is \\(\\boxed{6}\\)."], "id": 2912, "generated_answers": ["6"], "gold_answer": "6", "is_correct": true, "answers_correctness": [true]}

We will use the principle of inclusion-exclusion to count the valid colorings.\n\n### Step 1: Total Number of Colorings\nFirst, we calculate the total number of ways to color the diagonals of the hexagon. A hexagon has \\(\\binom{6}{2} - 6 = 9\\) diagonals. Each diagonal can be either red or blue, so there are \\(2^9 = 512\\) possible colorings.\n\n### Step 2: Counting Invalid Colorings\nWe need to count the number of colorings where at least one triangle has no red sides. We will use the principle of inclusion-exclusion to do this.\n\n#### Step 2.1: Single Triangle\nConsider a single triangle \\(A_i A_j A_k\\). For this triangle to have no red sides, all three sides (which are diagonals) must be blue. There are \\(\\binom{6}{3} = 20\\) triangles in the hexagon.

There are \\(\\binom{6}{5} = 6\\) ways to choose 5 vertices to form three triangles sharing a common vertex. Each set of three triangles can be colored in \\(1\\) way (all blue), and the remaining 4 diagonals can be colored in \\(2^4 = 16\\) ways. Thus, the number of colorings where three specific triangles have no red sides is \\(1 \\times 16 = 16\\).\n\n#### Step 2.4: Four Triangles\nFinally, we consider the case where four triangles share a common side.

Let's try the next largest combination:\n   - If we replace 5 with 4, the sum becomes:\n     \\[\n     9 + 8 + 7 + 6 + 4 = 34\n     \\]\n     34 is not divisible by 9.\n   - If we replace 4 with 3, the sum becomes:\n     \\[\n     9 + 8 + 7 + 6 + 3 = 33\n     \\]\n     33 is not divisible by 9.\n   - If we replace 3 with 2, the sum becomes:\n     \\[\n     9 + 8 + 7 + 6 + 2 = 32\n     \\]\n     32 is not divisible by 9.\n   - If we replace 2 with 1, the sum becomes:\n     \\[\n     9 + 8 + 7 + 6 + 1 = 31\n     \\]\n     31 is not divisible by 9.\n   - If we replace 1 with 0, the sum becomes:\n     \\[\n     9 + 8 + 7 + 6 + 0 = 30\n     \\]\n     30 is not divisible by 9.\n\n   We need to find another combination. Let's try:\n   - If we replace 6 with 5, the sum becomes:\n     \\[\n     9 + 8 + 7 + 5 + 4 = 33\n     \\]\n     33 is not divisible by 9.\n   - If we replace 5 with 4, the sum becomes:\n     \\[\n     9 + 8 + 7 + 4 + 3 = 31\n     \\]\n     31 is not divisible by 9.\n   - If we replace 4 with 3, the sum becomes:\n     \\[\n     9 + 8 + 7 + 3 + 2 = 29\n     \\]\n     29 is not divisible by 9.\n   - If we replace 3 with 2, the sum becomes:\n     \\[\n     9 + 8 + 7 + 2 + 1 = 27\n     \\]\n     27 is divisible by 9.\n\n6. **Form the largest number:**\n   The digits 9, 8, 7, 2, and 1 sum to 27, which is divisible by 9. To form the largest number, we arrange these digits in descending order:\n   \\[\n   98721\n   \\]\n\n7. **Check divisibility by 7:**\n   We need to check if 98721 is divisible by 7:\n   \\[\n   98721 \\div 7 = 14103\n   \\]\n   Since 14103 is an integer, 98721 is divisible by 7.\n\nTherefore, the largest 5-digit number with distinct digits that is a multiple of 63 is \\(\\boxed{98721}\\)."], "id": 2971, "generated_answers": ["98721"], "gold_answer": "98721", "is_correct": true, "answers_correctness": [true]}

The digits 0 and 5 are not present, so we only consider the digits 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9, 11, 12, 13, 14, 16, 17, 18, 19, 21, 22, 23, 24, 26, 27, 28, 29, 31, 32, 33, 34, 36, 37, 38, 39, 41, 42, 43, 44, 46, 47, 48, 49, 51, 52, 53, 54, 56, 57, 58, 59, 61, 62, 63, 64, 66, 67, 68, 69, 71, 72, 73, 74, 76, 77, 78, 79, 81, 82, 83, 84, 86, 87, 88, 89, 91, 92, 93, 94, 96, 97, 98, 99.\n\n- The product of these digits is a very large number, but we only need the last three digits (modulo 125).\n- We can use the fact that the product of all digits from 1 to 99 (excluding 0 and 5) is a multiple of 125 because it includes the factors 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35, 40, 45, 50, 55, 60, 65, 70, 75, 80, 85, 90, 95, and 100, which are all multiples of 5.\n\nThus, the product of the remaining digits modulo 125 is 0.\n\n### Step 4: Combine the results using the Chinese Remainder Theorem\nWe have:\n\\[\nP \\equiv 0 \\pmod{8}\n\\]\n\\[\nP \\equiv 0 \\pmod{125}\n\\]\n\nSince 8 and 125 are coprime, the only number that satisfies both congruences is 0.\n\n### Final Answer\n\\[\n\\boxed{0}\n\\]"], "id": 3007, "generated_answers": ["0"], "gold_answer": "976", "is_correct": false, "answers_correctness": [false]}

Then, we subtract the number of ways to choose 3 vertices such that at least two are adjacent.\n\n   - The number of ways to choose 3 vertices such that at least two are adjacent can be calculated by considering the cases where exactly two vertices are adjacent and the third is not adjacent to either of the first two.\n\n   - The number of ways to choose 3 vertices such that exactly two are adjacent is \\(16 \\times 13\\), because we can choose the pair of adjacent vertices in 16 ways, and the third vertex in 13 ways (since it cannot be adjacent to either of the first two).\n\n   - The number of ways to choose 3 vertices such that all three are adjacent is 16, because we can choose any set of 3 consecutive vertices.\n\n   Therefore, the number of valid configurations is:\n   \\[\n   \\binom{16}{3} - 16 \\times 13 + 16 = 560 - 208 + 16 = 368\n   \\]\n\n6. **Conclusion:**\n   The number of noncongruent triangles that can be formed by extending three sides of a regular 16-gon is \\(\\boxed{368}\\)."], "id": 3086, "generated_answers": ["368"], "gold_answer": "11", "is_correct": false, "answers_correctness": [false]}
