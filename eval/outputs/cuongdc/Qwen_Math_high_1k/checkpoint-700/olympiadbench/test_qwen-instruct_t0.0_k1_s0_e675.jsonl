Therefore, we only need to consider the distinct values of \\( N \\) modulo the LCM of the relevant moduli.\n\n4. **Determining the Number of Moves:**\n   - To determine \\( N \\) uniquely, Sergey needs to ask questions that provide enough information to distinguish between all possible values of \\( N \\) modulo the LCM of the moduli.\n   - Since \\( N \\) is a positive integer not exceeding 5000, there are at most 5000 possible values for \\( N \\).\n   - To distinguish between 5000 possible values, Sergey needs to ask enough questions to reduce the number of possible values to 1.\n\n5. **Using Binary Search:**\n   - Sergey can use a binary search-like approach to determine \\( N \\).\n   - By asking about subsets \\( S \\) of \\(\\{1, 2, \\ldots, 20\\}\\), Sergey can effectively halve the number of possible values for \\( N \\) with each question.\n   - The number of questions required to reduce 5000 possible values to 1 is given by the binary logarithm of 5000, which is approximately \\( \\log_2(5000) \\approx 12.29 \\).\n\n6. **Conclusion:**\n   - Since Sergey cannot ask a fraction of a question, he needs to round up to the next whole number.\n   - Therefore, Sergey needs at least 13 moves to determine \\( N \\) for sure.\n\nThus, the number of moves Sergey needs is \\(\\boxed{13}\\)."], "id": 1606, "generated_answers": ["13"], "gold_answer": "2", "is_correct": false, "answers_correctness": [false]}

Let's break this down step by step.\n\n### Step 1: Understanding the Weight of a Number\nThe weight of a positive integer \\(n\\) is defined as the number of 1's in its binary representation. For example, the number 5 in binary is \\(101\\), so its weight is 2.\n\n### Step 2: Counting the Total Number of Integers\nThe total number of positive integers at most \\(2^{2017}\\) is \\(2^{2017} - 1\\). This is because \\(2^{2017}\\) itself is not included.\n\n### Step 3: Symmetry in Binary Representation\nConsider the binary representation of numbers from 1 to \\(2^{2017} - 1\\). Each number can be represented as a 2017-bit binary string (since \\(2^{2017} - 1\\) is a 2017-bit number).\n\n### Step 4: Parity of the Weight\nThe weight of a number is the number of 1's in its binary representation. We need to count the number of numbers with even weight and the number of numbers with odd weight.\n\n### Step 5: Using Combinatorial Argument\nFor a 2017-bit binary string, the number of 1's can range from 0 to 2017. The number of ways to choose \\(k\\) 1's out of 2017 bits is given by the binomial coefficient \\(\\binom{2017}{k}\\).\n\n### Step 6: Summing the Binomial Coefficients\nThe total number of 2017-bit binary strings is \\(2^{2017}\\). This can be expressed as the sum of binomial coefficients:\n\\[\n2^{2017} = \\sum_{k=0}^{2017} \\binom{2017}{k}\n\\]\n\n### Step 7: Splitting into Even and Odd Weights\nWe need to split this sum into the sum of binomial coefficients for even \\(k\\) and the sum for odd \\(k\\):\n\\[\n2^{2017} = \\sum_{\\text{even } k} \\binom{2017}{k} + \\sum_{\\text{odd } k} \\binom{2017}{k}\n\\]\n\n### Step 8: Using the Binomial Theorem\nUsing the binomial theorem, we know:\n\\[\n(1 + 1)^{2017} = \\sum_{k=0}^{2017} \\binom{2017}{k} = 2^{2017}\n\\]\n\\[\n(1 - 1)^{2017} = \\sum_{k=0}^{2017} \\binom{2017}{k} (-1)^k = 0\n\\]\n\n### Step 9: Solving for Even and Odd Sums\nFrom the above, we have:\n\\[\n\\sum_{\\text{even } k} \\binom{2017}{k} - \\sum_{\\text{odd } k} \\binom{2017}{k} = 0\n\\]\n\\[\n\\sum_{\\text{even } k} \\binom{2017}{k} = \\sum_{\\text{odd } k} \\binom{2017}{k}\n\\]\n\n### Step 10: Total Number of Integers\nThe total number of positive integers at most \\(2^{2017}\\) is \\(2^{2017} - 1\\). Since the number of even-weight numbers equals the number of odd-weight numbers, each of these counts is:\n\\[\n\\frac{2^{2017} - 1}{2}\n\\]\n\n### Step 11: Difference Between Even and Odd Weight Numbers\nThe difference between the number of positive integers with even weight and the number of positive integers with odd weight is:\n\\[\n\\left( \\frac{2^{2017} - 1}{2} \\right) - \\left( \\frac{2^{2017} - 1}{2} \\right) = 0\n\\]\n\nThus, the final answer is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{0}\n\\]"], "id": 1612, "generated_answers": ["0"], "gold_answer": "$2^{1009}$", "is_correct": false, "answers_correctness": [false]}

This means \\( t(n) \\) and \\( t(n+a) \\) will have different parities, and their difference cannot be divisible by 4. Therefore, \\( a \\) cannot be odd.\n\n### Step 4: Considering \\( a \\) as a Power of 2\nNext, consider \\( a = 2^m \\) for some integer \\( m \\). We need to check if all differences \\( t(n+2^m) - t(n), t(n+2^m+1) - t(n+1), \\ldots, t(n+2^{m+1}-1) - t(n+2^m-1) \\) are divisible by 4.\n\n### Step 5: Verifying \\( a = 2^m \\)\nFor \\( a = 2^m \\), consider the sequence \\( n, n+1, \\ldots, n+2^m-1 \\). Each number in this sequence can be written as \\( n + k \\) where \\( k \\) ranges from 0 to \\( 2^m-1 \\). The largest odd divisor of \\( n + k \\) will be the same as the largest odd divisor of \\( n + k + 2^m \\) because adding \\( 2^m \\) does not change the highest power of 2 dividing the number. Therefore, \\( t(n+k) = t(n+k+2^m) \\).\n\nThus, for \\( a = 2^m \\), all differences \\( t(n+2^m) - t(n), t(n+2^m+1) - t(n+1), \\ldots, t(n+2^{m+1}-1) - t(n+2^m-1) \\) are zero, which is divisible by 4.\n\n### Conclusion\nThe only positive integers \\( a \\) for which there exists a positive integer \\( n \\) such that all the differences are divisible by 4 are the powers of 2. Therefore, the final answer is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{2^k \\text{ for } k \\in \\mathbb{N}}\n\\]"], "id": 1709, "generated_answers": ["2^k \\text{ for } k \\in \\mathbb{N}"], "gold_answer": "1,3,5", "is_correct": false, "answers_correctness": [false]}

In chess, a king can move to any adjacent square, so no two kings can be placed in squares that are horizontally, vertically, or diagonally adjacent.\n2. **Each row and each column contains exactly 25 kings**: This means we need to place 25 kings in each row and 25 kings in each column.\n\n### Step 2: Visualizing the Problem\nTo satisfy the condition that no two kings can capture each other, we can use a checkerboard pattern.

This ensures that no two kings are adjacent and each row and each column contains exactly 25 kings.\n\n### Step 6: Verifying the Arrangement\n- Each row has 100 squares, and we place 25 kings on black squares and 25 kings on white squares.\n- Each column also has 100 squares, and we place 25 kings on black squares and 25 kings on white squares.\n- Since the placement is symmetric and follows the checkerboard pattern, no two kings can capture each other.\n\n### Step 7: Counting the Number of Arrangements\nThe number of ways to choose 25 black squares out of 50 in each row is given by the binomial coefficient \\(\\binom{50}{25}\\).

Two players draw disjoint sets \\( A \\) and \\( B \\) of 100 cards each. We need to define a rule to determine the winner based on the relative order of the 200 cards.\n\n### Step 2: Conditions to Satisfy\n1.

This suggests a lexicographic order based on the elements of the sets.\n\n### Step 4: Lexicographic Order\nThe lexicographic order is a way to order sequences (or sets) of elements. For two sets \\( A \\) and \\( B \\) of 100 elements each, we can compare them lexicographically by comparing their elements one by one.\n\n### Step 5: Defining the Rule\nWe can define the rule as follows:\n- Compare the elements of \\( A \\) and \\( B \\) in increasing order.\n- If \\( a_i > b_i \\) for all \\( i \\), then \\( A \\) beats \\( B \\).\n- If \\( a_i < b_i \\) for all \\( i \\), then \\( B \\) beats \\( A \\).\n- If there is no \\( i \\) such that \\( a_i > b_i \\) or \\( a_i < b_i \\) for all \\( i \\), then the rule is not defined.\n\n### Step 6: Verifying the Conditions\n1. **Relative Order Dependence**: The rule depends only on the relative order of the 200 cards.\n2. **Transitivity**: If \\( A \\) beats \\( B \\) and \\( B \\) beats \\( C \\), then \\( a_i > b_i \\) for all \\( i \\) and \\( b_i > c_i \\) for all \\( i \\). Therefore, \\( a_i > c_i \\) for all \\( i \\), so \\( A \\) beats \\( C \\).\n\n### Step 7: Counting the Number of Ways to Define the Rule\nThe rule we defined is unique and satisfies all the given conditions.

For \\( n > 5 \\), \\( f(n) = 0 \\).\n\n### Step 4: Calculating \\( f(n) \\) for \\( 1 \\leq n \\leq 5 \\)\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\nf(1) &= \\binom{4}{0} = 1, \\\\\nf(2) &= \\binom{4}{1} = 4, \\\\\nf(3) &= \\binom{4}{2} = 6, \\\\\nf(4) &= \\binom{4}{3} = 4, \\\\\nf(5) &= \\binom{4}{4} = 1.\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\n\n### Step 5: Units Digit of \\( f(n) \\)\nWe need to determine how many of these values have a units digit of 1:\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\nf(1) &= 1 \\quad (\\text{units digit is 1}), \\\\\nf(2) &= 4 \\quad (\\text{units digit is 4}), \\\\\nf(3) &= 6 \\quad (\\text{units digit is 6}), \\\\\nf(4) &= 4 \\quad (\\text{units digit is 4}), \\\\\nf(5) &= 1 \\quad (\\text{units digit is 1}).\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\n\n### Step 6: Counting the Values with Units Digit 1\nFrom the above, \\( f(1) \\) and \\( f(5) \\) have a units digit of 1. Therefore, there are 2 values of \\( f(n) \\) for \\( 1 \\leq n \\leq 5 \\) that have a units digit of 1.\n\n### Step 7: Extending to \\( f(1), f(2), \\ldots, f(2014) \\)\nFor \\( n > 5 \\), \\( f(n) = 0 \\), which has a units digit of 0. Thus, the only values of \\( f(n) \\) with a units digit of 1 are \\( f(1) \\) and \\( f(5) \\).\n\n### Final Answer\nThe number of integers \\( f(1), f(2), \\ldots, f(2014) \\) that have a units digit of 1 is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{2}\n\\]"], "id": 2350, "generated_answers": ["2"], "gold_answer": "202", "is_correct": false, "answers_correctness": [false]}

From 5 blue and 1 green hat to 4 blue and 2 green hats.\n\n#### Probability of Case 1\n- Probability of first turn: \\(\\frac{2}{3}\\)\n- Probability of second turn: \\(\\frac{1}{2}\\)\n- Total probability for Case 1: \\(\\frac{2}{3} \\times \\frac{1}{2} = \\frac{1}{3}\\)\n\n#### Probability of Case 2\n- Probability of first turn: \\(\\frac{1}{3}\\)\n- Probability of second turn: \\(\\frac{5}{6}\\)\n- Total probability for Case 2: \\(\\frac{1}{3} \\times \\frac{5}{6} = \\frac{5}{18}\\)\n\n### Final Probability\nThe total probability that the bag contains 4 blue hats and 2 green hats after two turns is the sum of the probabilities of the two cases:\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{3} + \\frac{5}{18} = \\frac{6}{18} + \\frac{5}{18} = \\frac{11}{18}\n\\]\n\nThus, the probability that the bag again contains 4 blue hats and 2 green hats after two turns is \\(\\boxed{\\frac{11}{18}}\\)."], "id": 2493, "generated_answers": ["\\frac{11}{18}"], "gold_answer": "$\\frac{11}{18}$", "is_correct": true, "answers_correctness": [true]}

This is given by the factorial of 25:\n\\[\n25!\n\\]\n\n### Step 2: Arrangements Where Charlie is Not Next to Chris or Abby\nNext, we need to find the number of arrangements where Charlie is not next to either Chris or Abby. We will use the principle of inclusion-exclusion to do this.\n\n#### Step 2.1: Arrangements Where Charlie is Not Next to Chris\nConsider Charlie and Chris as two distinct individuals. We need to count the number of ways to arrange 25 people such that Charlie and Chris are not next to each other.\n\n1. **Total arrangements of 25 people**: \\(25!\\)\n2. **Arrangements where Charlie and Chris are next to each other**: Treat Charlie and Chris as a single \"block\".

The sides of the hexagon are already colored red, so we only need to consider the diagonals.\n\n### Step 1: Count the total number of diagonals\nA hexagon has 6 vertices. The number of diagonals in a hexagon is given by:\n\\[\n\\frac{6(6-3)}{2} = 9\n\\]\nSo, there are 9 diagonals.\n\n### Step 2: Total number of colorings\nEach of the 9 diagonals can be either red or blue. Therefore, the total number of colorings is:\n\\[\n2^9 = 512\n\\]\n\n### Step 3: Use the principle of inclusion-exclusion\nWe need to count the number of colorings such that every triangle \\( A_i A_j A_k \\) has at least one red side. We will use the principle of inclusion-exclusion to count the number of colorings that do not satisfy this condition and subtract it from the total number of colorings.\n\n### Step 4: Count the number of colorings where at least one triangle has no red sides\nFirst, we count the number of triangles in the hexagon. A hexagon has:\n\\[\n\\binom{6}{3} = 20\n\\]\ntriangles.\n\n#### Case 1: One triangle has no red sides\nIf one triangle has no red sides, all three of its sides must be blue. There are 20 such triangles. For each of these triangles, the remaining 6 diagonals can be colored in any way:\n\\[\n2^6 = 64\n\\]\nThus, the number of colorings where at least one specific triangle has no red sides is:\n\\[\n20 \\times 64 = 1280\n\\]\n\n#### Case 2: Two triangles have no red sides\nIf two triangles have no red sides, they must share at least one side. There are several sub-cases to consider, but we can use the fact that the total number of such colorings is overcounted in the previous step.

Each side is of equal length, and each internal angle is \\(157.5^\\circ\\).\n\n2. **Identify the Possible Triangles:**\n   We need to extend three sides of the 16-gon to form a triangle. The key is to ensure that the vertices of the triangle do not lie on the 16-gon itself.\n\n3. **Count the Number of Ways to Choose 3 Sides:**\n   We can choose 3 sides out of the 16 sides in \\(\\binom{16}{3}\\) ways. However, not all combinations of 3 sides will form a triangle. We need to ensure that the chosen sides do not form a degenerate triangle (i.e., they do not lie on a straight line).\n\n4. **Determine the Valid Combinations:**\n   To form a valid triangle, the chosen sides must not be adjacent or form a straight line. We need to count the number of such valid combinations.\n\n5. **Calculate the Number of Noncongruent Triangles:**\n   We need to consider the symmetry of the 16-gon.

There are 16 ways to choose the first side, and the third side is fixed as the side 8 positions away. However, this counts each pair of sides twice, so we divide by 2:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Number of invalid combinations forming a straight line} = \\frac{16}{2} = 8\n     \\]\n\n4. **Valid Combinations:**\n   \\[\n   \\text{Number of valid combinations} = 560 - 96 - 8 = 456\n   \\]\n\n5. **Noncongruent Triangles:**\n   - Due to the rotational symmetry of the 16-gon, each valid triangle can be rotated into 16 different positions.

Therefore, we can simplify \\(\\sin \\frac{(5-T) \\pi}{2}\\) using the identity \\(\\sin(\\pi - x) = \\sin x\\).\n\nNotice that:\n\\[\n\\frac{(5-T) \\pi}{2} = \\pi - \\frac{T \\pi}{2}\n\\]\n\nThus:\n\\[\n\\sin \\frac{(5-T) \\pi}{2} = \\sin \\left( \\pi - \\frac{T \\pi}{2} \\right) = \\sin \\frac{T \\pi}{2}\n\\]\n\nNow, substitute this back into the original expression:\n\\[\n\\sin^2 \\frac{T \\pi}{2} + \\sin^2 \\left( \\pi - \\frac{T \\pi}{2} \\right) = \\sin^2 \\frac{T \\pi}{2} + \\sin^2 \\frac{T \\pi}{2}\n\\]\n\nSince \\(\\sin^2 x + \\sin^2 x = 2 \\sin^2 x\\), we have:\n\\[\n\\sin^2 \\frac{T \\pi}{2} + \\sin^2 \\frac{T \\pi}{2} = 2 \\sin^2 \\frac{T \\pi}{2}\n\\]\n\nHowever, we need to consider the range of \\(T\\). Since \\(T\\) is a rational number, \\(\\frac{T \\pi}{2}\\) can be any rational multiple of \\(\\pi\\). The sine function squared, \\(\\sin^2 x\\), always ranges from 0 to 1. Therefore, the sum of two such squared sine values will always be 1 if they are complementary angles.\n\nGiven that \\(\\sin^2 x + \\cos^2 x = 1\\), and knowing that \\(\\sin \\left( \\pi - x \\right) = \\sin x\\), we can conclude:\n\\[\n\\sin^2 \\frac{T \\pi}{2} + \\sin^2 \\left( \\pi - \\frac{T \\pi}{2} \\right) = 1\n\\]\n\nThus, the final answer is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{1}\n\\]"], "id": 3100, "generated_answers": ["1"], "gold_answer": "1", "is_correct": true, "answers_correctness": [true]}
