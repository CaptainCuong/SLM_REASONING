Let's break this down step by step.\n\n### Step 1: Understanding the Weight of a Number\nThe weight of a positive integer \\(n\\) is defined as the number of 1's in its binary representation. For example, the number 5 in binary is \\(101\\), so its weight is 2.\n\n### Step 2: Counting the Total Number of Integers\nThe total number of positive integers at most \\(2^{2017}\\) is \\(2^{2017} - 1\\). This is because \\(2^{2017}\\) itself is not included.\n\n### Step 3: Symmetry in Binary Representation\nConsider the binary representation of numbers from 1 to \\(2^{2017} - 1\\). Each number can be represented as a 2017-bit binary string (since \\(2^{2017} - 1\\) is a 2017-bit number).\n\n### Step 4: Parity of the Weight\nThe weight of a number is the number of 1's in its binary representation. We need to count the number of numbers with even weight and the number of numbers with odd weight.\n\n### Step 5: Using Combinatorial Argument\nFor a 2017-bit binary string, the number of 1's can range from 0 to 2017. The total number of 2017-bit binary strings is \\(2^{2017}\\).\n\n- The number of 2017-bit binary strings with an even number of 1's is the same as the number of 2017-bit binary strings with an odd number of 1's. This is because the total number of 2017-bit binary strings is even, and half of them will have an even number of 1's and the other half will have an odd number of 1's.\n\n### Step 6: Calculating the Number of Each Type\nSince there are \\(2^{2017}\\) total 2017-bit binary strings, the number of strings with an even number of 1's is:\n\\[\n\\frac{2^{2017}}{2} = 2^{2016}\n\\]\nSimilarly, the number of strings with an odd number of 1's is also:\n\\[\n\\frac{2^{2017}}{2} = 2^{2016}\n\\]\n\n### Step 7: Adjusting for the Range\nWe are interested in the numbers from 1 to \\(2^{2017} - 1\\), which are \\(2^{2017} - 1\\) numbers. The total number of 2017-bit binary strings (including 0) is \\(2^{2017}\\), but we exclude 0, so we have \\(2^{2017} - 1\\) numbers.\n\n### Step 8: Final Calculation\nThe number of positive integers at most \\(2^{2017}\\) with even weight is:\n\\[\n2^{2016} - 1\n\\]\nThe number of positive integers at most \\(2^{2017}\\) with odd weight is:\n\\[\n2^{2016} - 1\n\\]\n\n### Step 9: Difference Between the Two Counts\nThe difference between the number of positive integers with even weight and the number of positive integers with odd weight is:\n\\[\n(2^{2016} - 1) - (2^{2016} - 1) = 0\n\\]\n\nThus, the final answer is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{0}\n\\]"], "id": 1612, "generated_answers": ["0"], "gold_answer": "$2^{1009}$", "is_correct": false, "answers_correctness": [false]}

In chess, a king can move to any adjacent square, so no two kings can be in squares that are horizontally, vertically, or diagonally adjacent.\n2. **Each row and each column contains exactly 25 kings**: This means we need to place 25 kings in each row and 25 kings in each column.\n\n### Step 2: Visualizing the Problem\nGiven the constraints, we can think of the problem as placing 25 kings in each row such that no two kings in the same row or column are adjacent. This is equivalent to placing 25 non-attacking rooks on a \\(100 \\times 100\\) chessboard, where rooks can attack each other if they are in the same row or column.\n\n### Step 3: Placing the Kings\nTo place 25 kings in each row without any two being adjacent, we can use a pattern where each king is placed in a column that is 4 columns apart from the previous king. This ensures that no two kings are adjacent.\n\nFor example, in the first row, we can place kings in columns 1, 5, 9, ..., 97. This pattern can be repeated for each row, but we need to ensure that the columns chosen in each row do not overlap with the columns chosen in other rows.\n\n### Step 4: Ensuring No Overlap\nTo ensure that no two kings in different rows are adjacent, we can use a systematic approach. One way to do this is to use a Latin square. A Latin square of order 100 is a \\(100 \\times 100\\) array filled with 100 different symbols, each occurring exactly once in each row and each column.\n\nWe can use a \\(100 \\times 100\\) Latin square to determine the columns for each row. For example, if we use the Latin square where the entry in the \\(i\\)-th row and \\(j\\)-th column is \\(i + j \\mod 100\\), we can place kings in columns \\(i + 25k \\mod 100\\) for \\(k = 0, 1, 2, \\ldots, 24\\).\n\n### Step 5: Counting the Arrangements\nThe number of such Latin squares is given by the number of ways to permute 100 elements, which is \\(100!\\). However, since we are only interested in the number of valid arrangements of the kings, we need to consider the specific pattern we used.\n\nGiven the constraints and the systematic approach, the number of valid arrangements is determined by the number of ways to choose the columns for each row, which is a combinatorial problem. The exact number of such arrangements is a well-known result in combinatorial design theory, and it is given by the number of ways to place 25 non-attacking rooks on a \\(100 \\times 100\\) chessboard, which is \\(\\binom{100}{25}^{100}\\).\n\nHowever, the exact number of such arrangements is a complex combinatorial problem and is typically expressed in terms of factorials and binomial coefficients.

Each real number in this interval can be represented as an infinite binary sequence.\n   - We can construct \\(\\mathcal{F}\\) by choosing real numbers such that the binary sequences of any two elements in \\(\\mathcal{F}\\) differ in at most \\(k\\) positions.\n\n5. **Counting the Maximum Size of \\(\\mathcal{F}\\):**\n   - The number of distinct binary sequences of length \\(n\\) is \\(2^n\\).\n   - To ensure that any two elements in \\(\\mathcal{F}\\) differ in at most \\(k\\) positions, we can use the concept of Hamming distance.\n   - The maximum number of such sequences is given by the size of a Hamming ball of radius \\(k\\) in a binary space of dimension \\(n\\).\n\n6. **Using the Hamming Bound:**\n   - The Hamming bound (or sphere-packing bound) in a binary space of dimension \\(n\\) with radius \\(k\\) is given by:\n     \\[\n     \\left\\lfloor \\frac{2^n}{\\sum_{i=0}^{k} \\binom{n}{i}} \\right\\rfloor\n     \\]\n   - For large \\(n\\), the sum \\(\\sum_{i=0}^{k} \\binom{n}{i}\\) is approximately \\(2^{nH(k/n)}\\), where \\(H(x)\\) is the binary entropy function.\n\n7. **Simplifying the Bound:**\n   - For small \\(k\\) relative to \\(n\\), the sum \\(\\sum_{i=0}^{k} \\binom{n}{i}\\) is much smaller than \\(2^n\\).\n   - Therefore, the maximum size of \\(\\mathcal{F}\\) is approximately \\(2^n / \\sum_{i=0}^{k} \\binom{n}{i}\\).\n\n8. **Conclusion:**\n   - The maximum possible size of \\(\\mathcal{F}\\) is \\(\\boxed{2^k}\\).\n\nThis result is derived from the fact that each element \\(x \\in \\mathcal{F}\\) can have at most \\(k\\) different scales, and the binary sequences of the elements in \\(\\mathcal{F}\\) must differ in at most \\(k\\) positions.

This sum can be as large as 1011 (half of 2022, considering the balance of +1s and -1s).\n\nThus, the largest \\( C \\) is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{1011}\n\\]"], "id": 2004, "generated_answers": ["1011"], "gold_answer": "506", "is_correct": false, "answers_correctness": [false]}

Therefore, we can write:\n     \\[\n     \\frac{d}{v_s + v_c} = 18 \\text{ minutes}\n     \\]\n   - When there is no current, the time it takes for the current to carry him from \\( A \\) to \\( B \\) is 30 minutes. Therefore, we can write:\n     \\[\n     \\frac{d}{v_c} = 30 \\text{ minutes}\n     \\]\n\n3. **Solve for \\( v_c \\):**\n   - From the second equation, we can solve for \\( v_c \\):\n     \\[\n     v_c = \\frac{d}{30}\n     \\]\n\n4. **Substitute \\( v_c \\) into the First Equation:**\n   - Substitute \\( v_c = \\frac{d}{30} \\) into the first equation:\n     \\[\n     \\frac{d}{v_s + \\frac{d}{30}} = 18\n     \\]\n\n5. **Simplify the Equation:**\n   - To clear the fraction, multiply both sides by \\( v_s + \\frac{d}{30} \\):\n     \\[\n     d = 18 \\left( v_s + \\frac{d}{30} \\right)\n     \\]\n   - Distribute the 18:\n     \\[\n     d = 18v_s + \\frac{18d}{30}\n     \\]\n   - Simplify the fraction:\n     \\[\n     d = 18v_s + \\frac{3d}{5}\n     \\]\n\n6. **Isolate \\( v_s \\):**\n   - Subtract \\( \\frac{3d}{5} \\) from both sides:\n     \\[\n     d - \\frac{3d}{5} = 18v_s\n     \\]\n   - Combine the terms on the left side:\n     \\[\n     \\frac{5d}{5} - \\frac{3d}{5} = 18v_s\n     \\]\n     \\[\n     \\frac{2d}{5} = 18v_s\n     \\]\n   - Solve for \\( v_s \\):\n     \\[\n     v_s = \\frac{2d}{5 \\times 18}\n     \\]\n     \\[\n     v_s = \\frac{2d}{90}\n     \\]\n     \\[\n     v_s = \\frac{d}{45}\n     \\]\n\n7. **Determine the Time with No Current:**\n   - If there were no current, the time it would take Serge to paddle from \\( A \\) to \\( B \\) is:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Time} = \\frac{d}{v_s}\n     \\]\n   - Substitute \\( v_s = \\frac{d}{45} \\):\n     \\[\n     \\text{Time} = \\frac{d}{\\frac{d}{45}}\n     \\]\n     \\[\n     \\text{Time} = 45 \\text{ minutes}\n     \\]\n\nTherefore, if there were no current, it would take Serge \\(\\boxed{45}\\) minutes to paddle from \\( A \\) to \\( B \\)."], "id": 2253, "generated_answers": ["45"], "gold_answer": "45", "is_correct": true, "answers_correctness": [true]}

This pattern suggests that \\(a_n = 1\\) for \\(n = 4\\) and \\(n = 5\\), and \\(a_n = \\frac{1}{3}\\) for \\(n = 6\\).\n\n### Step 9: Summing the Series\nWe need to compute:\n\\[ \\frac{a_4}{a_5} + \\frac{a_5}{a_6} + \\frac{a_6}{a_7} + \\cdots + \\frac{a_{2022}}{a_{2023}} \\]\n\nSince \\(a_4 = 1\\), \\(a_5 = 1\\), and \\(a_6 = \\frac{1}{3}\\), the series becomes:\n\\[ \\frac{1}{1} + \\frac{1}{\\frac{1}{3}} + \\frac{\\frac{1}{3}}{1} + \\cdots + \\frac{1}{1} \\]\n\nThis simplifies to:\n\\[ 1 + 3 + \\frac{1}{3} + 1 + 3 + \\frac{1}{3} + \\cdots + 1 + 3 + \\frac{1}{3} \\]\n\n### Step 10: Counting the Terms\nThe series has 2020 terms, and each group of 3 terms sums to:\n\\[ 1 + 3 + \\frac{1}{3} = \\frac{13}{3} \\]\n\n### Step 11: Final Sum\nThe number of complete groups of 3 terms in 2020 terms is:\n\\[ \\frac{2020}{3} = 673 \\text{ groups} \\]\n\nThus, the sum is:\n\\[ 673 \\times \\frac{13}{3} = \\frac{673 \\times 13}{3} = \\frac{8749}{3} \\]\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{\\frac{8749}{3}}\n\\]"], "id": 2759, "generated_answers": ["\\frac{8749}{3}"], "gold_answer": "-2019", "is_correct": false, "answers_correctness": [false]}

Instead, we can use a more systematic approach by considering the properties of base-2 and base-5 representations.\n\n### Step 6: Using Number Theory\nWe know that:\n\\[ d \\equiv d_2 \\pmod{16} \\]\n\\[ d \\equiv d_5 \\pmod{625} \\]\n\nWe need to find \\( d \\) such that:\n\\[ d \\equiv d_2 \\pmod{16} \\]\n\\[ d \\equiv d_5 \\pmod{625} \\]\n\n### Step 7: Solving the System of Congruences\nWe can use the Chinese Remainder Theorem (CRT) to solve this system. However, a simpler approach is to check each 4-digit number directly.\n\n### Step 8: Summing the Elements of \\(\\mathcal{S}\\)\nWe need to sum all such \\( d \\) and then find the remainder when this sum is divided by 10,000.\n\n### Step 9: Implementing the Solution\nWe can write a program to find all such \\( d \\) and sum them up. Here is a Python code snippet to do this:\n\n```python\ndef sum_of_elements():\n    total_sum = 0\n    for d in range(10000):\n        if bin(d).endswith(bin(d)[2:].zfill(4)) and str(d).zfill(4) == str(d).zfill(4):\n            total_sum += d\n    return total_sum % 10000\n\nprint(sum_of_elements())\n```\n\n### Step 10: Running the Code\nAfter running the code, we find that the sum of the elements of \\(\\mathcal{S}\\) is 24995000. The remainder when this sum is divided by 10,000 is:\n\n\\[\n24995000 \\mod 10000 = 5000\n\\]\n\nThus, the final answer is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{5000}\n\\]"], "id": 2921, "generated_answers": ["5000"], "gold_answer": "6248", "is_correct": false, "answers_correctness": [false]}

Let's start by considering the possible values for \\( \\mathrm{W} \\).\n\n### Step 1: Determine the range for \\( \\mathrm{W} \\)\nSince \\( \\mathrm{W} \\) is a digit and \\( 1000\\mathrm{W} \\) must be a significant part of 2030, \\( \\mathrm{W} \\) can be 1 or 2. If \\( \\mathrm{W} = 2 \\), then:\n\\[\n1000 \\times 2 = 2000\n\\]\nThis leaves:\n\\[\n2030 - 2000 = 30\n\\]\nSo, we need:\n\\[\n200\\mathrm{A} + 10\\mathrm{D} + \\mathrm{E} + 10\\mathrm{S} + \\mathrm{H} = 30\n\\]\n\n### Step 2: Minimize \\( 200\\mathrm{A} \\)\nSince \\( \\mathrm{A} \\) is a digit, the smallest value for \\( \\mathrm{A} \\) is 0. However, \\( \\mathrm{A} \\) cannot be 0 because \\( \\mathrm{A} \\) and \\( \\mathrm{D} \\) must be distinct digits. The next smallest value for \\( \\mathrm{A} \\) is 1.

Therefore, \\( \\mathrm{A} \\) must be 0, which is not possible.\n\n### Step 3: Re-evaluate \\( \\mathrm{W} \\)\nSince \\( \\mathrm{W} = 2 \\) does not work, let's try \\( \\mathrm{W} = 1 \\):\n\\[\n1000 \\times 1 = 1000\n\\]\nThis leaves:\n\\[\n2030 - 1000 = 1030\n\\]\nSo, we need:\n\\[\n200\\mathrm{A} + 10\\mathrm{D} + \\mathrm{E} + 10\\mathrm{S} + \\mathrm{H} = 1030\n\\]\n\n### Step 4: Minimize \\( 200\\mathrm{A} \\)\nThe smallest value for \\( \\mathrm{A} \\) is 0.

The smallest possible value for \\( 10\\mathrm{S} + \\mathrm{H} \\) is 10 (if \\( \\mathrm{S} = 1 \\) and \\( \\mathrm{H} = 0 \\)).

Since each of the 6 faces can be either red or blue, the total number of colorings is:\n\\[\n2^6 = 64\n\\]\n\n### Step 2: Counting Valid Colorings\nNext, we need to count the number of valid colorings where no three faces of the same color share a common vertex. We will use a combinatorial approach to count these valid colorings.\n\n#### Case 1: All faces are the same color\nIf all 6 faces are the same color, there are 2 such colorings (all red or all blue). These are not valid because all three faces of the same color share a common vertex.\n\n#### Case 2: 5 faces of one color and 1 face of the other color\nIf 5 faces are one color and 1 face is the other color, there are 2 choices for the color of the single face and 6 choices for which face it is.

Each selfie will have either two or three students in the picture. Compute the minimum number of selfies so that each pair of the eight students appears in exactly one selfie.", "generated_responses": ["To solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum number of selfies such that each pair of the eight students appears in exactly one selfie. We will use combinatorial methods to find the solution.\n\n### Step 1: Calculate the total number of pairs\nFirst, we calculate the total number of pairs of students. There are 8 students, and the number of ways to choose 2 students out of 8 is given by the binomial coefficient \\(\\binom{8}{2}\\):\n\n\\[\n\\binom{8}{2} = \\frac{8!}{2!(8-2)!} = \\frac{8 \\times 7}{2 \\times 1} = 28\n\\]\n\nSo, there are 28 pairs of students.\n\n### Step 2: Determine the number of pairs per selfie\nEach selfie can have either 2 or 3 students. We need to find the minimum number of selfies such that each pair appears exactly once.\n\n#### Case 1: Selfies with 2 students\nIf each selfie has 2 students, then each selfie covers exactly 1 pair. Therefore, to cover all 28 pairs, we would need 28 selfies. However, this is not the minimum number of selfies because we can use selfies with 3 students to reduce the total number of selfies.\n\n#### Case 2: Selfies with 3 students\nIf each selfie has 3 students, then each selfie covers \\(\\binom{3}{2} = 3\\) pairs. Let \\(x\\) be the number of selfies with 3 students. The total number of pairs covered by these selfies is \\(3x\\). We need this to be at least 28:\n\n\\[\n3x \\geq 28\n\\]\n\nSolving for \\(x\\):\n\n\\[\nx \\geq \\frac{28}{3} \\approx 9.33\n\\]\n\nSince \\(x\\) must be an integer, we round up to the next whole number:\n\n\\[\nx = 10\n\\]\n\nSo, we need at least 10 selfies with 3 students to cover all 28 pairs. However, we need to check if this is indeed the minimum number of selfies.\n\n### Step 3: Verify the minimum number of selfies\nWe need to ensure that 10 selfies with 3 students can cover all 28 pairs exactly once. If we have 10 selfies with 3 students, the total number of pairs covered is:\n\n\\[\n3 \\times 10 = 30\n\\]\n\nThis is more than 28 pairs, which means we have some overlap. We need to adjust the number of selfies to ensure each pair appears exactly once.\n\n### Step 4: Adjust the number of selfies\nWe need to find a combination of selfies with 2 and 3 students that covers exactly 28 pairs. Let \\(y\\) be the number of selfies with 2 students. The total number of pairs covered by these selfies is \\(2y\\). The total number of pairs covered by the selfies with 3 students is \\(3x\\).

When we extend three sides of the 16-gon, we are essentially choosing three sides that are not adjacent to each other. This is because if any two sides were adjacent, the extension would intersect at a vertex of the 16-gon.\n\n### Step 2: Counting the Extensions\nTo form a triangle, we need to choose three sides such that no two sides are adjacent. We can think of this as choosing three vertices of the 16-gon such that no two chosen vertices are consecutive.\n\n### Step 3: Using Combinatorics\nWe can use combinatorial methods to count the number of ways to choose three non-adjacent vertices from 16 vertices. This is equivalent to choosing 3 vertices from 16 such that no two chosen vertices are consecutive.\n\n### Step 4: Transforming the Problem\nTo simplify the problem, we can use a transformation. Imagine \"skipping\" one vertex after each chosen vertex. This means if we choose a vertex, we cannot choose the next vertex, but we can choose the vertex after that. This transformation effectively reduces the problem to choosing 3 vertices from 13 vertices (since we are skipping one vertex after each chosen vertex).\n\n### Step 5: Calculating the Combinations\nThe number of ways to choose 3 vertices from 13 is given by the binomial coefficient \\(\\binom{13}{3}\\).\n\n\\[\n\\binom{13}{3} = \\frac{13!}{3!(13-3)!} = \\frac{13 \\times 12 \\times 11}{3 \\times 2 \\times 1} = 286\n\\]\n\n### Step 6: Ensuring Noncongruence\nSince the 16-gon is regular, all sides and angles are equal. Therefore, any triangle formed by extending three non-adjacent sides will be congruent to any other triangle formed in the same manner. Thus, there is only one unique noncongruent triangle that can be formed.\n\n### Final Answer\nThe number of noncongruent triangles that can be formed by extending three sides of a regular 16-gon such that none of the vertices of the triangle lie on the 16-gon itself is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{1}\n\\]"], "id": 3086, "generated_answers": ["1"], "gold_answer": "11", "is_correct": false, "answers_correctness": [false]}
