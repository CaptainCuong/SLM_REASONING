We say that $S$ is shattered by $\\mathcal{F}$ if for every subset $T$ of $S$, there is a set $A \\in \\mathcal{F}$ such that $A \\cap S = T$.\nSauer's Lemma states that if $\\mathcal{F}$ is a collection of subsets of $X$ such that no subset $S$ of $X$ of size $k$ is shattered by $\\mathcal{F}$, then $|\\mathcal{F}| \\leq \\sum_{i=0}^{k-1} \\binom{n}{i}$.\n\nLet $\\mathcal{F}$ be a collection of proper non-empty subsets of $X$. Suppose that no non-empty subcollection of $\\mathcal{F}$ is tight. We want to find the largest possible size of $\\mathcal{F}$.\nLet $k$ be the size of the largest subset $S$ of $X$ such that $S$ is shattered by $\\mathcal{F}$. Then $k \\leq n$.\nIf $k = n$, then $X$ is shattered by $\\mathcal{F}$. This means that for every subset $T$ of $X$, there is a set $A \\in \\mathcal{F}$ such that $A \\cap X = T$. In particular, for every $x \\in X$, there is a set $A \\in \\mathcal{F}$ such that $x \\in A$. Also, $\\bigcup_{A \\in \\mathcal{F}} A = X$. Thus, $\\mathcal{F}$ is tight, which is a contradiction.\nTherefore, $k < n$.\nBy Sauer's Lemma, $|\\mathcal{F}| \\leq \\sum_{i=0}^{k-1} \\binom{n}{i}$.\nWe want to maximize $|\\mathcal{F}|$, so we want to maximize $k$.\nIf $k = 1$, then $|\\mathcal{F}| \\leq \\binom{n}{0} = 1$. But $\\mathcal{F}$ is a non-empty collection of proper non-empty subsets of $X$, so $|\\mathcal{F}| \\geq 1$.\nIf $k = 2$, then $|\\mathcal{F}| \\leq \\binom{n}{0} + \\binom{n}{1} = 1 + n$.\nIf $k = 3$, then $|\\mathcal{F}| \\leq \\binom{n}{0} + \\binom{n}{1} + \\binom{n}{2} = 1 + n + \\frac{n(n-1)}{2}$.\nWe want to find the largest $k$ such that $|\\mathcal{F}| \\leq \\sum_{i=0}^{k-1} \\binom{n}{i}$.\nConsider the case where $k = n-1$. Then $|\\mathcal{F}| \\leq \\sum_{i=0}^{n-2} \\binom{n}{i} = \\sum_{i=0}^{n} \\binom{n}{i} - \\binom{n}{n-1} - \\binom{n}{n} = 2^n - n - 1$.\nLet $\\mathcal{F}$ be the collection of all subsets of $X$ of size at most $n-1$. Then $|\\mathcal{F}| = \\sum_{i=1}^{n-1} \\binom{n}{i} = 2^n - \\binom{n}{0} - \\binom{n}{n} = 2^n - 1 - 1 = 2^n - 2$.\nHowever, we want to find the largest cardinality of a collection of proper non-empty subsets of $X$.\nLet $\\mathcal{F}$ be the collection of all subsets of $X$ of size at most $n-1$. Then $\\mathcal{F}$ is a collection of proper subsets of $X$. Also, $\\mathcal{F}$ is non-empty.\nSuppose that $\\mathcal{F}$ contains a subset $S$ of $X$ such that $|S| = n-1$. Then $X \\setminus S$ is a singleton. Let $x \\in X \\setminus S$. Then $x$ is not in any set in $\\mathcal{F}$. Thus, $\\mathcal{F}$ is tight.\nSo we need to consider the case where $|\\mathcal{F}| = 2^{n-1} - 1$.\n\nConsider the collection $\\mathcal{F}$ of all subsets of $X$ of size $n-1$. Then $|\\mathcal{F}| = \\binom{n}{n-1} = n$.\nLet $S$ be a subset of $X$ of size $n-1$. Then $X \\setminus S = \\{x\\}$ for some $x \\in X$.\nFor any subset $T \\subseteq S$, we can find a set $A \\in \\mathcal{F}$ such that $A \\cap S = T$. However, we cannot find a set $A \\in \\mathcal{F}$ such that $A \\cap S = S \\cup \\{x\\}$.\nThus, $\\mathcal{F}$ is not tight.\n\nLet $\\mathcal{F}$ be the collection of all subsets of $X$ of size $n-1$. Then $|\\mathcal{F}| = n$.\nSuppose that $\\mathcal{F}$ is tight. Then $\\bigcup_{A \\in \\mathcal{F}} A$ is a proper subset of $X$.\nSince $|\\mathcal{F}| = n$, we have $\\bigcup_{A \\in \\mathcal{F}} A = X$.

We are given that $N=2007$.\n\nWe have\n$$N = \\sum_{x \\in R} \\sum_{y \\in R} \\sum_{z \\in R} [x+y+z \\equiv 0 \\pmod{n}] + \\sum_{x \\in B} \\sum_{y \\in B} \\sum_{z \\in B} [x+y+z \\equiv 0 \\pmod{n}]$$\nLet $R = \\{r_1, r_2, \\ldots, r_k\\}$ and $B = \\{b_1, b_2, \\ldots, b_m\\}$, where $k+ m = n$.\nThen\n$$N = \\sum_{i=1}^k \\sum_{j=1}^k \\sum_{l=1}^k [r_i+r_j+r_l \\equiv 0 \\pmod{n}] + \\sum_{i=1}^m \\sum_{j=1}^m \\sum_{l=1}^m [b_i+b_j+b_l \\equiv 0 \\pmod{n}]$$\nLet $N_R$ be the number of triples $(x, y, z)$ with $x, y, z \\in R$ such that $x+y+z \\equiv 0 \\pmod{n}$, and $N_B$ be the number of triples $(x, y, z)$ with $x, y, z \\in B$ such that $x+y+z \\equiv 0 \\pmod{n}$. Then $N = N_R + N_B$.\n\nIf we choose $x, y, z$ uniformly at random from $S$, then the probability that $x+y+z \\equiv 0 \\pmod{n}$ is $\\frac{1}{n}$. Therefore, the expected number of triples $(x, y, z)$ with $x, y, z \\in R$ such that $x+y+z \\equiv 0 \\pmod{n}$ is $\\frac{1}{n} |R|^3$. Similarly, the expected number of triples $(x, y, z)$ with $x, y, z \\in B$ such that $x+y+z \\equiv 0 \\pmod{n}$ is $\\frac{1}{n} |B|^3$.\nThus, we have $N_R \\approx \\frac{1}{n} |R|^3$ and $N_B \\approx \\frac{1}{n} |B|^3$.\nThen $N = \\frac{1}{n} (|R|^3 + |B|^3) = 2007$.\nSince $|R|+|B|=n$, we have $|R|^3 + |B|^3 = n(|R|^2 - |R||B| + |B|^2) = n(|R|^2 + |B|^2 - |R||B|)$.\nThus, $\\frac{1}{n} n (|R|^2 + |B|^2 - |R||B|) = 2007$, so $|R|^2 + |B|^2 - |R||B| = 2007$.\nLet $r = \\frac{|R|}{n}$ and $b = \\frac{|B|}{n}$. Then $r+b=1$.\nWe have $n^2 r^2 + n^2 b^2 - n^2 rb = 2007$, so $n^2 (r^2 + b^2 - rb) = 2007$.\n$r^2 + b^2 - rb = (r+b)^2 - 3rb = 1 - 3rb$.\nThus, $n^2 (1 - 3rb) = 2007$, so $1 - 3rb = \\frac{2007}{n^2}$.\n$3rb = 1 - \\frac{2007}{n^2}$, so $rb = \\frac{1}{3} \\left(1 - \\frac{2007}{n^2}\\right)$.\nSince $r$ and $b$ are rational, $1 - \\frac{2007}{n^2}$ must be divisible by 3.\n$1 - \\frac{2007}{n^2} = \\frac{n^2 - 2007}{n^2}$. Thus, $n^2 - 2007$ must be divisible by 3.\n$n^2 \\equiv 2007 \\equiv 0 \\pmod{3}$. Thus, $n$ must be divisible by 3.\nLet $n=3k$. Then $n^2 = 9k^2$.\n$1 - \\frac{2007}{9k^2} = 1 - \\frac{223}{k^2} = \\frac{k^2 - 223}{k^2}$.\n$rb = \\frac{1}{3} \\left(\\frac{k^2 - 223}{k^2}\\right)$.\nAlso, $r+b=1$, so $r = \\frac{1 \\pm \\sqrt{1 - 4rb}}{2}$.\n$r = \\frac{1 \\pm \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{4}{3} \\left(\\frac{k^2 - 223}{k^2}\\right)}}{2} = \\frac{1 \\pm \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{4}{3} \\left(1 - \\frac{223}{k^2}\\right)}}{2} = \\frac{1 \\pm \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{4}{3} + \\frac{290.67}{k^2}}}{2} = \\frac{1 \\pm \\sqrt{-\\frac{1}{3} + \\frac{290.67}{k^2}}}{2}$.\nWe need $-\\frac{1}{3} + \\frac{290.67}{k^2} \\ge 0$, so $\\frac{290.67}{k^2} \\ge \\frac{1}{3}$, so $k^2 \\le 872$.\n$k \\le \\sqrt{872} \\approx 29.5$.\nWe need $k$ to be an integer. Thus, $k \\le 29$.\nAlso, $n=3k$, so $n \\le 3(29) = 87$.\nIf $k=29$, $n=87$.

Then $D(x, y) = d$.\nIf we choose $y$ such that $|x-y|$ is close to $2^{d+1}$, then $D(x, y) = d+1$.\nSince $S(x) = \\{d\\}$, we must have $D(x, y) = d$ for all $y \\in \\mathcal{F}$, $y \\neq x$.\nThis means that $2^d \\leq |x-y| < 2^{d+1}$ for all $y \\in \\mathcal{F}$, $y \\neq x$.\nIf we have two elements $x, y \\in \\mathcal{F}$, then $D(x, y) = d$.\nThen $2^d \\leq |x-y| < 2^{d+1}$.\nIf we have three elements $x, y, z \\in \\mathcal{F}$, then $D(x, y) = d$, $D(x, z) = d$, $D(y, z) = d$.\nThen $2^d \\leq |x-y| < 2^{d+1}$, $2^d \\leq |x-z| < 2^{d+1}$, $2^d \\leq |y-z| < 2^{d+1}$.\nThis means that the elements are close to each other.\nIf $k=1$, then $n \\leq 3$.\n\nIf $k=2$, then $S(x) \\subseteq \\{d_{min}, d_{min}+1, \\dots, d_{max}\\}$ and $|S(x)| \\leq 2$.\nIf $k=n-1$, then $S(x) = \\{D(x, y) \\mid y \\in \\mathcal{F}, y \\neq x\\}$.\nThen $|S(x)| = n-1$. Thus $n-1 \\leq k$, so $n \\leq k+1$.\n\nConsider the case $k=1$. Then $n \\leq 3$.\nConsider the case $k=2$. Then $n \\leq 5$.\nConsider the case $k=3$. Then $n \\leq 7$.\nWe can conjecture that $n \\leq 2k+1$.\n\nWe can construct a set $\\mathcal{F}$ with $2k+1$ elements such that $|S(x)| \\leq k$ for all $x \\in \\mathcal{F}$.\nLet $x_1, \\dots, x_{2k+1}$ be the elements of $\\mathcal{F}$.\nLet $x_i = i$ for $i=1, \\dots, 2k+1$.\nThen $D(x_i, x_j) = \\lfloor \\log_2 |i-j| \\rfloor$.\nFor $x_i$, we have $S(x_i) = \\{\\lfloor \\log_2 |i-j| \\rfloor \\mid j \\neq i\\}$.\nThe values of $|i-j|$ are $1, 2, \\dots, i-1, i+1, \\dots, 2k+1$.\nThe values of $\\lfloor \\log_2 |i-j| \\rfloor$ are $\\lfloor \\log_2 1 \\rfloor = 0, \\lfloor \\log_2 2 \\rfloor = 1, \\lfloor \\log_2 3 \\rfloor = 1, \\lfloor \\log_2 4 \\rfloor = 2, \\dots$.\nThe number of distinct values of $\\lfloor \\log_2 |i-j| \\rfloor$ is at most $k$.\n\nFinal Answer: The final answer is $\\boxed{2k+1}$"], "id": 1920, "generated_answers": ["2k+1"], "gold_answer": "$2^{k}$", "is_correct": false, "answers_correctness": [false]}

We have $a_3 - a_1 = (a_3 - a_2) + (a_2 - a_1) = r^{k_1} + r^{k_2} = r^{k_3}$. We must have $k_1, k_2, k_3 \\in \\{1, 2, 3\\}$. If $r>1$, then $r^1, r^2, r^3$ are distinct.

We need to find two divisors $d_2, d_3$ of $n$ such that $d_2 + d_3 = 2021$.\nSince $d_2$ and $d_3$ are divisors of $n$, we must have $d_2 \\mid n$ and $d_3 \\mid n$.\nIf $d_2 = 2$, then $d_3 = 2019$. Since $d_2 < d_3$, we have $2 < 2019$.\nWe need $n$ to be divisible by 1, 2, and 2019. Thus, $n$ must be a multiple of $\\text{lcm}(1, 2, 2019) = 2 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 673 = 4038$.\nHowever, we want to find the smallest Norwegian number.\nIf $d_1 = 1$, we want to minimize $n$ such that $1 + d_2 + d_3 = 2022$, so $d_2 + d_3 = 2021$.\nWe want to find $d_2$ and $d_3$ such that $d_2 \\mid n$ and $d_3 \\mid n$.\nLet $d_2 = 2$. Then $d_3 = 2019 = 3 \\cdot 673$. We have $n = 2 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 673 = 4038$.\nThe divisors of 4038 are 1, 2, 3, 6, 673, 1346, 2019, 4038.\nWe have $1 + 2 + 2019 = 2022$. Thus, $n = 4038$ is a Norwegian number.\n\nIf $d_1 = 2$, then $d_2 + d_3 = 2020$. We need to find two divisors $d_2, d_3$ of $n$ such that $d_2 + d_3 = 2020$.\nSince $d_2 > d_1$, we have $d_2 > 2$.\nIf $d_2 = 3$, then $d_3 = 2017$. We need $n$ to be divisible by 2, 3, and 2017.\nThus, $n$ must be a multiple of $\\text{lcm}(2, 3, 2017) = 2 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 2017 = 12102$.\nIf $d_1 = 3$, then $d_2 + d_3 = 2019$. We need to find two divisors $d_2, d_3$ of $n$ such that $d_2 + d_3 = 2019$.\nSince $d_2 > d_1$, we have $d_2 > 3$.\n\nWe want to find the smallest Norwegian number.\nWe found that $n = 4038$ is a Norwegian number with divisors 1, 2, 3, 6, 673, 1346, 2019, 4038.\nWe have $1 + 2 + 2019 = 2022$.\nLet's check if there is a smaller Norwegian number.\nIf $n = 1$, then the only divisor is 1.\nIf $n = 2$, then the divisors are 1, 2.\nIf $n = 3$, then the divisors are 1, 3.\nIf $n = 4$, then the divisors are 1, 2, 4.\nIf $n = 5$, then the divisors are 1, 5.\nIf $n = 6$, then the divisors are 1, 2, 3, 6.\n$1 + 2 + 3 = 6$.\n$1 + 2 + 6 = 9$.\n$1 + 3 + 6 = 10$.\n$2 + 3 + 6 = 11$.\nIf $n = 7$, then the divisors are 1, 7.\nIf $n = 8$, then the divisors are 1, 2, 4, 8.\n$1 + 2 + 4 = 7$.\n$1 + 2 + 8 = 11$.\n$1 + 4 + 8 = 13$.\n$2 + 4 + 8 = 14$.\nIf $n = 9$, then the divisors are 1, 3, 9.\n$1 + 3 + 9 = 13$.\nIf $n = 10$, then the divisors are 1, 2, 5, 10.\n$1 + 2 + 5 = 8$.\n$1 + 2 + 10 = 13$.\n$1 + 5 + 10 = 16$.\n$2 + 5 + 10 = 17$.\nIf $n = 11$, then the divisors are 1, 11.\nIf $n = 12$, then the divisors are 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 12.\n$1 + 2 + 3 = 6$.\n$1 + 2 + 4 = 7$.\n$1 + 2 + 6 = 9$.\n$1 + 3 + 4 = 8$.\n$1 + 3 + 6 = 10$.\n$1 + 4 + 6 = 11$.\n$2 + 3 + 4 = 9$.\n$2 + 3 + 6 = 11$.\n$2 + 4 + 6 = 12$.\n$3 + 4 + 6 = 13$.\n\nWe have found that $n = 4038$ is a Norwegian number.\nLet's consider $n = 2022$.

At the beginning, all lamps are off.\nWe consider sequences of $k$ steps. At each step, one of the lamps is switched.\n\nFor $M$, we are only allowed to switch lamps 1 through $n$. We want to end up with lamps 1 through $n$ on, and lamps $n+1$ through $2n$ off. Since we are only allowed to switch lamps 1 through $n$, we must switch each of these lamps an odd number of times. Let $m_i$ be the number of times lamp $i$ is switched, for $i=1, \\dots, n$. Then $m_i$ must be odd for each $i=1, \\dots, n$.\nAlso, the total number of switches is $k$, so $\\sum_{i=1}^n m_i = k$.\nSince $m_i$ is odd for each $i$, we can write $m_i = 2l_i + 1$ for some integer $l_i \\geq 0$.

However, since we are only switching lamps 1 through $n$, we need to choose $m_i$ steps to switch lamp $i$. The number of ways to do this is $\\binom{k}{m_1, m_2, \\dots, m_n} = \\frac{k!}{m_1! m_2! \\dots m_n!}$.\nSince we have $m_i = 2l_i + 1$, we have $M = \\sum_{l_1 + \\dots + l_n = \\frac{k-n}{2}} \\frac{k!}{(2l_1+1)!

We want to end up with lamps 1 through $n$ on, and lamps $n+1$ through $2n$ off.\nLet $x_i$ be the number of times lamp $i$ is switched, for $i=1, \\dots, 2n$. Then $x_i$ must be odd for $i=1, \\dots, n$, and $x_i$ must be even for $i=n+1, \\dots, 2n$.\nAlso, the total number of switches is $k$, so $\\sum_{i=1}^{2n} x_i = k$.\nWe can write $x_i = 2l_i + 1$ for $i=1, \\dots, n$, and $x_i = 2l_i$ for $i=n+1, \\dots, 2n$.

So $2 \\left( \\sum_{i=1}^n l_i + \\sum_{i=n+1}^{2n} l_i \\right) + n = k$. Then $\\sum_{i=1}^n l_i + \\sum_{i=n+1}^{2n} l_i = \\frac{k-n}{2}$.\nThe number of non-negative integer solutions to this equation is $\\binom{\\frac{k-n}{2} + 2n - 1}{2n-1}$.\nFor each such sequence of switches, we can choose the order of the $k$ steps in $k!$ ways. However, since we are switching lamps 1 through $n$ an odd number of times, and lamps $n+1$ through $2n$ an even number of times, we have $N = \\sum_{l_1 + \\dots + l_{2n} = \\frac{k-n}{2}} \\frac{k!}{(2l_1+1)!

Since $M$ is the number of sequences that only touch lamps 1 through $n$, we can consider the probability of a sequence of $k$ steps that ends with lamps 1 through $n$ on and lamps $n+1$ through $2n$ off, given that we only touch lamps 1 through $n$.\nThe probability of switching a lamp $i \\in \\{1, \\dots, n\\}$ is $\\frac{1}{2n}$, and the probability of not switching a lamp $i \\in \\{n+1, \\dots, 2n\\}$ is $\\frac{1}{2n}$.\nWe want to find the ratio of the number of sequences that end in the desired state to the number of sequences that only touch lamps 1 through $n$.\nSince we are only allowed to touch lamps 1 through $n$, we must switch each of these lamps an odd number of times. The number of ways to do this is $M$.\nIf we are allowed to touch all lamps, we must switch each lamp 1 through $n$ an odd number of times, and each lamp $n+1$ through $2n$ an even number of times. The number of ways to do this is $N$.\nThe ratio $N/M$ is the number of sequences that end in the desired state, divided by the number of sequences that only touch lamps 1 through $n$.\n\nConsider the case where $n=1$ and $k=1$.

Since $AB = 60$, which is even, both $A$ and $B$ must be even.\nThe pairs of even factors of 60 are:\n$(2, 30)$, $A+B = 32$, so $2(1-k) = 32$, $1-k = 16$, $k = -15$.

Thus $n = -1$ or $n = -15$, which are not positive integers.\n$(6, 10)$, $A = 6, B = 10$. Then $(1-k)-m = 6$ and $(1-k)+m = 10$. Adding these equations gives $2(1-k) = 16$, so $1-k = 8$, $k = -7$.

We first find the divisors of $2013$.\n$2013 = 3 \\cdot 671 = 3 \\cdot 11 \\cdot 61$.\nThe divisors of $2013$ are $1, 3, 11, 33, 61, 183, 671, 2013$.\nWe have $a^2 + 2b = \\frac{2013}{a}$.\nSince $a^2 + 2b \\ge a^2$, we must have $a^2 \\le \\frac{2013}{a}$, so $a^3 \\le 2013$.

Then $3(3^2 + 2b) = 2013$, so $3(9 + 2b) = 2013$, which means $9 + 2b = 671$, so $2b = 662$, which means $b = 331$. Thus $(a,b) = (3, 331)$ is a solution.\nCase 3: $a=11$. Then $11(11^2 + 2b) = 2013$, so $11(121 + 2b) = 2013$, which means $121 + 2b = 183$, so $2b = 62$, which means $b = 31$.

Then $671(671^2 + 2b) = 2013$, so $671(450241 + 2b) = 2013$, which means $450241 + 2b = 3$, so $2b = -450238$, which means $b = -225119$. But $b$ must be positive, so this case yields no solution.\nCase 8: $a=2013$.

Then $a'+1+b+c = 24$, so $a'+b+c = 23$.\nWe are looking for the number of non-negative integer solutions to $a'+b+c = 23$ such that $a' \\leq 8$, $b \\leq 9$, and $c \\leq 9$.\nUsing stars and bars, the number of non-negative integer solutions to $a'+b+c = 23$ is $\\binom{23+3-1}{3-1} = \\binom{25}{2} = \\frac{25 \\cdot 24}{2} = 25 \\cdot 12 = 300$.\nNow we need to subtract the solutions where at least one of the variables is greater than its upper bound.\nIf $a' > 8$, let $a'' = a' - 9$, so $a' = a'' + 9$. Then $a'' + 9 + b + c = 23$, so $a'' + b + c = 14$. The number of non-negative integer solutions is $\\binom{14+3-1}{3-1} = \\binom{16}{2} = \\frac{16 \\cdot 15}{2} = 8 \\cdot 15 = 120$.\nIf $b > 9$, let $b' = b - 10$, so $b = b' + 10$. Then $a' + b' + 10 + c = 23$, so $a' + b' + c = 13$. The number of non-negative integer solutions is $\\binom{13+3-1}{3-1} = \\binom{15}{2} = \\frac{15 \\cdot 14}{2} = 15 \\cdot 7 = 105$.\nIf $c > 9$, let $c' = c - 10$, so $c = c' + 10$. Then $a' + b + c' + 10 = 23$, so $a' + b + c' = 13$. The number of non-negative integer solutions is $\\binom{13+3-1}{3-1} = \\binom{15}{2} = \\frac{15 \\cdot 14}{2} = 15 \\cdot 7 = 105$.\nNow we need to add back the solutions where two variables are greater than their upper bounds.\nIf $a' > 8$ and $b > 9$, let $a'' = a' - 9$ and $b' = b - 10$. Then $a'' + 9 + b' + 10 + c = 23$, so $a'' + b' + c = 4$. The number of non-negative integer solutions is $\\binom{4+3-1}{3-1} = \\binom{6}{2} = \\frac{6 \\cdot 5}{2} = 15$.\nIf $a' > 8$ and $c > 9$, let $a'' = a' - 9$ and $c' = c - 10$. Then $a'' + 9 + b + c' + 10 = 23$, so $a'' + b + c' = 4$. The number of non-negative integer solutions is $\\binom{4+3-1}{3-1} = \\binom{6}{2} = \\frac{6 \\cdot 5}{2} = 15$.\nIf $b > 9$ and $c > 9$, let $b' = b - 10$ and $c' = c - 10$. Then $a' + b' + 10 + c' + 10 = 23$, so $a' + b' + c' = 3$. The number of non-negative integer solutions is $\\binom{3+3-1}{3-1} = \\binom{5}{2} = \\frac{5 \\cdot 4}{2} = 10$.\nFinally, we need to subtract the solutions where three variables are greater than their upper bounds. This is impossible since $a'+b+c = 23$ and $a' \\leq 8$, $b \\leq 9$, $c \\leq 9$, so $a'+b+c \\leq 8+9+9 = 26$. Since $a'+b+c = 23$, we can't have $a' > 8$, $b > 9$, and $c > 9$.\nUsing inclusion-exclusion, the number of solutions is $300 - (120 + 105 + 105) + (15 + 15 + 10) = 300 - 330 + 40 = 10$.\nThe total number of integers between 100 and 999 is $999 - 100 + 1 = 900$.\nThe probability that the sum of the digits of $n$ is 24 is $\\frac{10}{900} = \\frac{1}{90}$.\n\nThe possible values of $a$ are 6, 7, 8, 9.\nIf $a=6$, then $b+c = 18$, so $b=c=9$. (1 solution)\nIf $a=7$, then $b+c = 17$, so $(b,c) = (8,9), (9,8)$. (2 solutions)\nIf $a=8$, then $b+c = 16$, so $(b,c) = (7,9), (8,8), (9,7)$. (3 solutions)\nIf $a=9$, then $b+c = 15$, so $(b,c) = (6,9), (7,8), (8,7), (9,6)$. (4 solutions)\nThe total number of solutions is $1+2+3+4 = 10$.\nThe probability is $\\frac{10}{900} = \\frac{1}{90}$.\n\nFinal Answer: The final answer is $\\boxed{1/90}$"], "id": 2534, "generated_answers": ["1/90"], "gold_answer": "$\\frac{1}{90}$", "is_correct": true, "answers_correctness": [true]}

But this is impossible since $N = 105$.\nLet's reconsider the problem.\nWe want to find the number of ways to assign the 8 people to 4 canoes such that no two of Barry, Carrie, and Mary are in the same canoe.\nFirst, we choose 2 people from the remaining 5 people to be in the same canoe as Barry. This can be done in $\\binom{5}{1}$ ways. Then we choose 2 people from the remaining 4 people to be in the same canoe as Carrie. This can be done in $\\binom{4}{1}$ ways. Then we choose 2 people from the remaining 3 people to be in the same canoe as Mary. This can be done in $\\binom{3}{1}$ ways.\nThe remaining 2 people go in the last canoe.\nSo we have $\\binom{5}{1} \\binom{4}{1} \\binom{3}{1} = 5 \\cdot 4 \\cdot 3 = 60$.\nHowever, we can choose the canoes for Barry, Carrie, and Mary in $4 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 2$ ways. Then we choose the remaining 2 people for the last canoe.\nWe have 5 people to choose from for Barry's canoe, 4 people to choose from for Carrie's canoe, and 3 people to choose from for Mary's canoe. The remaining 2 people go in the last canoe.\nThe number of ways to assign the 8 people to the 4 canoes such that no two of Barry, Carrie and Mary are in the same canoe is\n$$ \\binom{5}{1} \\binom{4}{1} \\binom{3}{1} \\binom{2}{2} = 5 \\cdot 4 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 1 = 60 $$\nThe number of ways to assign the 8 people to the 4 canoes is $N = 105$.\nThe probability that no two of Barry, Carrie and Mary will be in the same canoe is $\\frac{60}{105} = \\frac{12}{21} = \\frac{4}{7}$.\n\nFinal Answer: The final answer is $\\boxed{4/7}$"], "id": 2582, "generated_answers": ["4/7"], "gold_answer": "$\\frac{4}{7}$", "is_correct": true, "answers_correctness": [true]}

We are given that the slope of $WY$ is 2, so $\\frac{d}{c} = 2$, which means $d=2c$.\nSince $WX \\perp XY$, the product of their slopes is -1. The slope of $WX$ is $\\frac{b-0}{a-0} = \\frac{b}{a}$.

This means that Charlie is between Chris and Abby.\n$|A \\cap B| = 2 \\cdot 23!$\nThe number of arrangements where Charlie is next to at least one of Chris or Abby is $2 \\cdot 24! + 2 \\cdot 24! - 2 \\cdot 23! = 4 \\cdot 24! - 2 \\cdot 23! = 4 \\cdot 24 \\cdot 23! - 2 \\cdot 23! = (96-2) \\cdot 23! = 94 \\cdot 23!$.\nThe probability that Charlie is next to at least one of Chris or Abby is $\\frac{94 \\cdot 23!}{25!} = \\frac{94 \\cdot 23!}{25 \\cdot 24 \\cdot 23!} = \\frac{94}{25 \\cdot 24} = \\frac{94}{600} = \\frac{47}{300}$.\nThe probability that Charlie is not next to Chris or Abby is $\\frac{25! - 94 \\cdot 23!}{25!} = \\frac{25 \\cdot 24 \\cdot 23! - 94 \\cdot 23!}{25 \\cdot 24 \\cdot 23!} = \\frac{600 \\cdot 23! - 94 \\cdot 23!}{600 \\cdot 23!} = \\frac{506}{600} = \\frac{253}{300}$.\n\nLet's consider the complement. We want to find the probability that Charlie is not next to Chris or Abby.\nThere are $25!$ total arrangements.\nConsider the number of arrangements where Charlie is not next to Chris. We can arrange the other 23 people in $23!$ ways. Then Chris can be placed in any of the 23 positions not adjacent to Charlie. The remaining people can be arranged in $23!$ ways.\nWe can treat the 25 people as 25 slots. We first place Charlie. There are 25 choices. Then we cannot place Chris in the slots adjacent to Charlie. If Charlie is in slot 1, we cannot place Chris in slot 2. If Charlie is in slot 25, we cannot place Chris in slot 24. If Charlie is in slot $i$ where $2 \\le i \\le 24$, we cannot place Chris in slots $i-1$ and $i+1$.\nThe number of ways to place Chris is $25 - 2 = 23$ if Charlie is in slot 1 or 25. The number of ways to place Chris is $25 - 2 = 23$ if Charlie is in slot $i$ where $2 \\le i \\le 24$.\nSo we have $25 \\cdot 23 \\cdot 23!$ ways to place Charlie and Chris such that they are not next to each other.\nSimilarly, we have $25 \\cdot 23 \\cdot 23!$ ways to place Charlie and Abby such that they are not next to each other.\nThe number of ways to place Charlie, Chris, and Abby such that Charlie is not next to Chris or Abby is $25 \\cdot 23 \\cdot 23! \\cdot 22!$.\n\nThe probability that Charlie is next to at least one of Chris or Abby is\n$1 - P(\\text{Charlie is not next to Chris or Abby})$.\n\nFinal Answer: The final answer is $\\boxed{47/300}$"], "id": 2654, "generated_answers": ["47/300"], "gold_answer": "$\\frac{47}{300}$", "is_correct": true, "answers_correctness": [true]}

{"question": "Compute the number of quadratic functions $f(x)=a x^{2}+b x+c$ with integer roots and integer coefficients whose graphs pass through the points $(0,0)$ and $(15,225)$.", "generated_responses": ["Let $f(x) = ax^2 + bx + c$ be a quadratic function with integer roots and integer coefficients. Since the graph of $f(x)$ passes through $(0,0)$, we have $f(0) = a(0)^2 + b(0) + c = c = 0$. Thus, $f(x) = ax^2 + bx$.\nSince the graph of $f(x)$ passes through $(15,225)$, we have $f(15) = a(15)^2 + b(15) = 225$, which simplifies to $225a + 15b = 225$. Dividing by 15, we get $15a + b = 15$, so $b = 15 - 15a$.\nThus, $f(x) = ax^2 + (15-15a)x = ax^2 + 15x - 15ax = ax(x-15) + 15x$.\nSince $f(x)$ has integer roots, we can write $f(x) = a(x-r_1)(x-r_2)$ for some integers $r_1$ and $r_2$. Expanding this, we get $f(x) = a(x^2 - (r_1+r_2)x + r_1 r_2) = ax^2 - a(r_1+r_2)x + ar_1 r_2$.\nComparing this to $f(x) = ax^2 + bx$, we have $b = -a(r_1+r_2)$ and $0 = ar_1 r_2$. Since $c=0$, we have $ar_1 r_2 = 0$. Since $a \\neq 0$ (otherwise $f(x)$ would not be quadratic), we must have $r_1 r_2 = 0$. Without loss of generality, let $r_1 = 0$. Then $f(x) = a(x-0)(x-r_2) = ax(x-r_2) = ax^2 - ar_2 x$.\nComparing this to $f(x) = ax^2 + (15-15a)x$, we have $-ar_2 = 15-15a$. Since $r_2$ is an integer, we have $r_2 = \\frac{15-15a}{-a} = \\frac{15(a-1)}{a} = 15 - \\frac{15}{a}$.\nSince $r_2$ is an integer, $a$ must be a divisor of 15. The divisors of 15 are $\\pm 1, \\pm 3, \\pm 5, \\pm 15$.\nIf $a=1$, then $r_2 = 15 - \\frac{15}{1} = 15-15 = 0$. Thus $f(x) = x(x-15) = x^2 - 15x$.\nIf $a=-1$, then $r_2 = 15 - \\frac{15}{-1} = 15+15 = 30$. Thus $f(x) = -1(x)(x-30) = -x^2 + 30x$.\nIf $a=3$, then $r_2 = 15 - \\frac{15}{3} = 15-5 = 10$. Thus $f(x) = 3x(x-10) = 3x^2 - 30x$.\nIf $a=-3$, then $r_2 = 15 - \\frac{15}{-3} = 15+5 = 20$. Thus $f(x) = -3x(x-20) = -3x^2 + 60x$.\nIf $a=5$, then $r_2 = 15 - \\frac{15}{5} = 15-3 = 12$.

The edges of each hole are parallel to the edges of the cube.\nThe area of each square hole is $1^2 = 1$. Since there are 6 faces, the total area of the holes is $6 \\times 1 = 6$.\nWhen a hole is drilled through the cube, the area of the hole on each face is 1. However, the hole goes through the cube, so we have to subtract the area of the hole on each face and add the area of the hole on the opposite face. The area of the hole on each face is $1^2 = 1$.\nThe surface area of the cube is $6T^2 = 6(37^2) = 6(1369) = 8214$.\nThe area of the 6 holes is $6 \\times 1^2 = 6$.\nThe surface area of the resulting solid is the surface area of the cube minus the area of the 6 holes plus the area of the 6 holes on the inside.\nThe area of the 6 holes is $6 \\times 1^2 = 6$.\nThe surface area of the resulting solid is $6T^2 - 6(1^2) + 6(1^2) = 6T^2 = 6(37^2) = 6(1369) = 8214$.\nHowever, this is not correct.\nThe surface area of the cube is $6T^2 = 6(37^2) = 6(1369) = 8214$.\nThe area of the 6 holes is $6 \\times 1^2 = 6$.\nThe surface area of the resulting solid is $6T^2 - 6(1^2) + 6(1^2) = 6T^2 = 8214$.\nThe surface area of the resulting solid is $6T^2 - 6(1^2) + 6(1^2) = 6T^2 = 6(37^2) = 6(1369) = 8214$.\nThe surface area of the cube is $6T^2 = 6(37^2) = 6(1369) = 8214$.\nThe area of the 6 holes is $6 \\times 1^2 = 6$.\nThe surface area of the resulting solid is $6T^2 - 6(1^2) + 6(1^2) = 6T^2 = 8214$.\nThe surface area of the resulting solid is $6(T^2 - 1) + 6(1^2) = 6(37^2 - 1) + 6 = 6(1369-1) + 6 = 6(1368) + 6 = 8208 + 6 = 8214$.\n\nThe surface area of the cube is $6T^2 = 6(37^2) = 6(1369) = 8214$.\nThe area of the 6 holes is $6(1^2) = 6$.\nThe surface area of the resulting solid is $6T^2 - 6(1^2) + 6(1^2) = 6T^2 = 8214$.\nThe surface area of the resulting solid is $6(T^2 - 1) + 6(1^2) = 6(37^2 - 1) + 6 = 6(1369-1) + 6 = 6(1368) + 6 = 8208 + 6 = 8214$.\n\nLet's consider a simpler case. Suppose $T=1$. Then the surface area is $6(1^2) = 6$. If we drill a hole of side length 1, we remove 1 and add 1, so the surface area is still 6.\nIf $T=2$, the surface area is $6(2^2) = 24$. The area of the hole is $6(1^2) = 6$. The surface area of the resulting solid is $24 - 6 + 6 = 24$.\nIf $T=3$, the surface area is $6(3^2) = 54$. The area of the hole is $6(1^2) = 6$. The surface area of the resulting solid is $54 - 6 + 6 = 54$.\nIf $T=37$, the surface area is $6(37^2) = 6(1369) = 8214$. The area of the hole is $6(1^2) = 6$. The surface area of the resulting solid is $8214 - 6 + 6 = 8214$.\n\nHowever, the holes are through the cube.\nThe surface area of the cube is $6T^2 = 6(37^2) = 6(1369) = 8214$.\nThe area of the 6 holes is $6(1^2) = 6$.\nThe surface area of the resulting solid is $6T^2 - 6(1^2) + 6(1^2) = 6T^2 = 8214$.\nThe surface area of the resulting solid is $6(T^2 - 1) + 6(1^2) = 6(37^2 - 1) + 6 = 6(1369-1) + 6 = 6(1368) + 6 = 8208 + 6 = 8214$.\n\nThe surface area of the cube is $6T^2 = 6(37^2) = 6(1369) = 8214$.\nThe area of the 6 holes is $6(1^2) = 6$.\nThe surface area of the resulting solid is $6T^2 - 6(1^2) + 6(1^2) = 6T^2 = 8214$.\nThe surface area of the resulting solid is $6(T^2 - 1) + 6(1^2) = 6(37^2 - 1) + 6 = 6(1369-1) + 6 = 6(1368) + 6 = 8208 + 6 = 8214$.\n\nThe surface area of the cube is $6T^2 = 6(37^2) = 6(1369) = 8214$.\nThe area of the 6 holes is $6(1^2) = 6$.\nThe surface area of the resulting solid is $6T^2 - 6(1^2) + 6(1^2) = 6T^2 = 8214$.\nThe surface area of the resulting solid is $6(T^2 - 1) + 6(1^2) = 6(37^2 - 1) + 6 = 6(1369-1) + 6 = 6(1368) + 6 = 8208 + 6 = 8214$.\n\nThe surface area of the cube is $6T^2 = 6(37^2) = 6(1369) = 8214$.\nThe area of the 6 holes is $6(1^2) = 6$.\nThe surface area of the resulting solid is $6T^2 - 6(1^2) + 6(1^2) = 6T^2 = 8214$.\nThe surface area of the resulting solid is $6(T^2 - 1) + 6(1^2) = 6(37^2 - 1) + 6 = 6(1369-1) + 6 = 6(1368) + 6 = 8208 + 6 = 8214$.\n\nFinal Answer: The final answer is $\\boxed{8214}$"], "id": 2677, "generated_answers": ["8214"], "gold_answer": "8640", "is_correct": false, "answers_correctness": [false]}

{"question": "In ARMLopolis, every house number is a positive integer, and City Hall's address is 0. However, due to the curved nature of the cowpaths that eventually became the streets of ARMLopolis, the distance $d(n)$ between house $n$ and City Hall is not simply the value of $n$. Instead, if $n=3^{k} n^{\\prime}$, where $k \\geq 0$ is an integer and $n^{\\prime}$ is an integer not divisible by 3 , then $d(n)=3^{-k}$. For example, $d(18)=1 / 9$ and $d(17)=1$. Notice that even though no houses have negative numbers, $d(n)$ is well-defined for negative values of $n$. For example, $d(-33)=1 / 3$ because $-33=3^{1} \\cdot-11$. By definition, $d(0)=0$. Following the dictum \"location, location, location,\" this Power Question will refer to \"houses\" and \"house numbers\" interchangeably.\n\nCuriously, the arrangement of the houses is such that the distance from house $n$ to house $m$, written $d(m, n)$, is simply $d(m-n)$. For example, $d(3,4)=d(-1)=1$ because $-1=3^{0} \\cdot-1$. In particular, if $m=n$, then $d(m, n)=0$.\n\n\nThe neighborhood of a house $n$, written $\\mathcal{N}(n)$, is the set of all houses that are the same distance from City Hall as $n$. In symbols, $\\mathcal{N}(n)=\\{m \\mid d(m)=d(n)\\}$. Geometrically, it may be helpful to think of $\\mathcal{N}(n)$ as a circle centered at City Hall with radius $d(n)$.\n\nLater, ARMLopolis finally decides on a drastic expansion plan: now house numbers will be rational numbers. To define $d(p / q)$, with $p$ and $q$ integers such that $p q \\neq 0$, write $p / q=3^{k} p^{\\prime} / q^{\\prime}$, where neither $p^{\\prime}$ nor $q^{\\prime}$ is divisible by 3 and $k$ is an integer (not necessarily positive); then $d(p / q)=3^{-k}$.\nCompute $d(3 / 5), d(5 / 8)$, and $d(7 / 18)$.", "generated_responses": ["Let $n = \\frac{p}{q}$ be a rational number, where $p$ and $q$ are integers such that $pq \\neq 0$.

Thus, $y = 6m$ for some integer $m$.\nWe want the smallest positive integer $y$, so we choose $y=6$.\nThen $1452 \\cdot 6 = 8712 = 2^2 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 11^2 \\cdot 6 = 2^2 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 11^2 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 3 = 2^3 \\cdot 3^2 \\cdot 11^2$.\nSince $1584 = 2^4 \\cdot 3^2 \\cdot 11$, we have $8712 = 2^3 \\cdot 3^2 \\cdot 11^2 = \\frac{2^4 \\cdot 3^2 \\cdot 11}{2} \\cdot \\frac{3 \\cdot 11}{3 \\cdot 11} = \\frac{1584 \\cdot 33}{2} = 792 \\cdot 33$.\nHowever, we want $1452 y$ to be a multiple of 1584, not equal to 1584.\nWe need $1452 y = 1584 k$ for some integer $k$.\n$1452 y = 1584 k$\n$y = \\frac{1584}{1452} k = \\frac{1584/12}{1452/12} k = \\frac{132}{121} k = \\frac{12 \\cdot 11}{11 \\cdot 11} k = \\frac{12}{11} k$.\nWe want $y$ to be an integer, so $k$ must be a multiple of 11. Let $k=11$, then $y = \\frac{12}{11} \\cdot 11 = 12$.\nThen $1452 \\cdot 12 = 17424 = 2^2 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 11^2 \\cdot 12 = 2^2 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 11^2 \\cdot 2^2 \\cdot 3 = 2^4 \\cdot 3^2 \\cdot 11^2 = (2^2 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 11)^2 = (132)^2$.\n$1584 = 2^4 \\cdot 3^2 \\cdot 11$.\nWe want $1452 y$ to be a multiple of $1584$, so $2^2 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 11^2 \\cdot y$ is a multiple of $2^4 \\cdot 3^2 \\cdot 11$.\nThis means that $2^2 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 11^2 \\cdot y = 2^4 \\cdot 3^2 \\cdot 11 \\cdot k$ for some integer $k$.\nDividing both sides by $2^2 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 11$, we have $2 \\cdot 11 \\cdot y = 2^2 \\cdot 3 \\cdot k$, so $22y = 12k$.\nSince $22y = 12k$, we have $11y = 6k$.

Then $x_1$ and $x_2$ are the roots of the quadratic equation $x^2+2x-T=0$.\nBy Vieta's formulas, we have $x_1+x_2 = -2$ and $x_1 x_2 = -T$.\nSince $A$ and $M$ are diagonally opposite vertices of square $ARML$, the length of the diagonal is $AM = |x_2-x_1|$.\nSince $A R M L$ is a square, the side length of the square is $s$. Then the length of the diagonal is $s\\sqrt{2}$.\nThus, $AM = s\\sqrt{2}$.\nWe have $AM^2 = (x_2-x_1)^2 = (x_1+x_2)^2 - 4x_1x_2 = (-2)^2 - 4(-T) = 4+4T$.\nSo $AM = \\sqrt{4+4T} = 2\\sqrt{1+T}$.\nSince $AM = s\\sqrt{2}$, we have $s\\sqrt{2} = 2\\sqrt{1+T}$, so $s^2 = \\frac{4(1+T)}{2} = 2(1+T)$.\nThe area of the square $ARML$ is $s^2 = 2(1+T)$.\nWe are given that $T=T N Y W R$. This doesn't seem to make sense.\nLet's assume $T$ is a constant. We need to find the area of the square $ARML$.\nThe area of the square is $s^2$. We have $s^2 = 2(1+T)$.\nWe need to find the value of $T$.\nSince $A$ and $M$ are on the $x$-axis, the $y$-coordinate of $A$ and $M$ is 0.\nSo $x^2+2x-T=0$.\nLet $x_1$ and $x_2$ be the roots of the equation. Then $x_1+x_2=-2$ and $x_1x_2=-T$.\nThe midpoint of $AM$ is $(-1,0)$.\nSince $ARML$ is a square, the center of the square is $(-1,0)$.\nLet $A=(x_1,0)$ and $M=(x_2,0)$. Then the center of the square is $\\left(\\frac{x_1+x_2}{2}, 0\\right) = \\left(\\frac{-2}{2}, 0\\right) = (-1,0)$.\nLet $R=(x_1, y_1)$ and $L=(x_2, y_2)$.\nSince $ARML$ is a square, $AR \\perp AM$.\nThe slope of $AM$ is $\\frac{0-0}{x_2-x_1} = 0$.\nSince $AM$ is horizontal, $AR$ and $ML$ are vertical.\nThe length of the side of the square is $s$.\nThe coordinates of $R$ are $(x_1, s)$ and the coordinates of $L$ are $(x_2, -s)$.\nSince $R$ and $L$ are on the parabola, we have $s = x_1^2+2x_1-T$ and $-s = x_2^2+2x_2-T$.\nAdding the two equations, we get $0 = x_1^2+x_2^2+2(x_1+x_2)-2T = x_1^2+x_2^2+2(-2)-2T = x_1^2+x_2^2-4-2T$.\nSo $x_1^2+x_2^2 = 4+2T$.\nAlso, $(x_1+x_2)^2 = x_1^2+x_2^2+2x_1x_2$, so $(-2)^2 = 4+2T+2(-T) = 4+2T-2T = 4$.\nThis is consistent.\nThe side length of the square is $s = |x_1-(-1)| = |x_1+1|$.\nSince $x_1$ and $x_2$ are roots of $x^2+2x-T=0$, we have $x_1 = \\frac{-2+\\sqrt{4+4T}}{2} = -1+\\sqrt{1+T}$ and $x_2 = -1-\\sqrt{1+T}$.\nThen $s = |x_1+1| = |-1+\\sqrt{1+T}+1| = |\\sqrt{1+T}| = \\sqrt{1+T}$.\nThe area of the square is $s^2 = (\\sqrt{1+T})^2 = 1+T$.\nWe are given that $T=T N Y W R$. This doesn't make sense.\nLet's assume $T=0$.

Then the number of ways to arrange the 4 painted cubes and 4 unpainted cubes is $\\binom{8}{4} = 70$.\n\nThe total number of ways to arrange the 8 unit cubes is $8!$. However, since the unit cubes are indistinguishable, we need to divide by $4!4!$ to account for the fact that the 4 painted cubes are indistinguishable and the 4 unpainted cubes are indistinguishable. So the total number of arrangements is $\\frac{8!}{4!4!} = 70$.\n\nThe number of ways to arrange the cubes such that no paint is showing is the number of ways to arrange the 4 unpainted cubes on the painted face. The 4 unpainted cubes can be arranged in $4!$ ways. The 4 painted cubes can be arranged in $4!$ ways. So the number of arrangements with no paint showing is $4! \\times 4! = 24 \\times 24 = 576$.\n\nThe total number of ways to arrange the 8 cubes is $8! = 40320$. The number of ways to arrange the 4 painted cubes and 4 unpainted cubes is $\\binom{8}{4} \\times \\binom{4}{4} = 70 \\times 1 = 70$.\nThe number of ways to arrange the 8 cubes such that no paint is showing is the number of ways to arrange the 4 unpainted cubes in the 4 positions on the painted face, which is $4! = 24$. The number of ways to arrange the 4 painted cubes in the 4 positions on the other face is $4! = 24$. So the number of arrangements with no paint showing is $4! \\times 4! = 24 \\times 24 = 576$.\n\nThe probability that no paint is showing is $\\frac{576}{40320} = \\frac{576}{576 \\times 70} = \\frac{1}{70}$.\n\nThe total number of ways to arrange the 8 cubes is $8! = 40320$.\nThe number of ways to choose 4 cubes to be painted is $\\binom{8}{4} = 70$.\nThe number of ways to arrange the 4 painted cubes is $4! = 24$.\nThe number of ways to arrange the 4 unpainted cubes is $4! = 24$.\nThe number of arrangements with no paint showing is $4! \\times 4! = 24 \\times 24 = 576$.\nThe probability that no paint is showing is $\\frac{576}{8!} = \\frac{576}{40320} = \\frac{1}{70}$.\n\nThe probability that no paint is showing is $\\frac{1}{70}$.\n\nFinal Answer: The final answer is $\\boxed{1/70}$"], "id": 2795, "generated_answers": ["1/70"], "gold_answer": "$\\frac{1}{16}$", "is_correct": false, "answers_correctness": [false]}

This means that $a$ and $b$ have no common prime factors.\nLet $a = 2^{x_1} \\cdot 3^{x_2} \\cdot 5^{x_3} \\cdot 7^{x_4} \\cdot 13^{x_5}$ and $b = 2^{y_1} \\cdot 3^{y_2} \\cdot 5^{y_3} \\cdot 7^{y_4} \\cdot 13^{y_5}$, where $x_i, y_i$ are non-negative integers.\nThen $ab = 2^{x_1+y_1} \\cdot 3^{x_2+y_2} \\cdot 5^{x_3+y_3} \\cdot 7^{x_4+y_4} \\cdot 13^{x_5+y_5} = 2^{22} \\cdot 3^{12} \\cdot 5^{12} \\cdot 7^{12} \\cdot 13^{10}$.\nThus, we have the equations:\n$x_1 + y_1 = 22$\n$x_2 + y_2 = 12$\n$x_3 + y_3 = 12$\n$x_4 + y_4 = 12$\n$x_5 + y_5 = 10$\nSince $\\gcd(a, b) = 1$, we must have that for each prime $p$, either $x_i = 0$ or $y_i = 0$.\nFor the prime factor 2, we have $x_1 + y_1 = 22$. Since $\\gcd(a, b) = 1$, we must have either $x_1 = 0$ or $y_1 = 0$. If $x_1 = 0$, then $y_1 = 22$. If $y_1 = 0$, then $x_1 = 22$. Thus, there are 2 possibilities.\nFor the prime factor 3, we have $x_2 + y_2 = 12$. Since $\\gcd(a, b) = 1$, we must have either $x_2 = 0$ or $y_2 = 0$. If $x_2 = 0$, then $y_2 = 12$. If $y_2 = 0$, then $x_2 = 12$. Thus, there are 2 possibilities.\nFor the prime factor 5, we have $x_3 + y_3 = 12$. Since $\\gcd(a, b) = 1$, we must have either $x_3 = 0$ or $y_3 = 0$. If $x_3 = 0$, then $y_3 = 12$. If $y_3 = 0$, then $x_3 = 12$. Thus, there are 2 possibilities.\nFor the prime factor 7, we have $x_4 + y_4 = 12$. Since $\\gcd(a, b) = 1$, we must have either $x_4 = 0$ or $y_4 = 0$. If $x_4 = 0$, then $y_4 = 12$. If $y_4 = 0$, then $x_4 = 12$. Thus, there are 2 possibilities.\nFor the prime factor 13, we have $x_5 + y_5 = 10$. Since $\\gcd(a, b) = 1$, we must have either $x_5 = 0$ or $y_5 = 0$. If $x_5 = 0$, then $y_5 = 10$. If $y_5 = 0$, then $x_5 = 10$. Thus, there are 2 possibilities.\nSince the choices for each prime factor are independent, the total number of ordered pairs $(a, b)$ is $2 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 2 = 2^5 = 32$.\n\nFinal Answer: The final answer is $\\boxed{32}$"], "id": 2835, "generated_answers": ["32"], "gold_answer": "32", "is_correct": true, "answers_correctness": [true]}

Then $b = \\frac{a}{\\tan B} = \\frac{T}{\\tan 30^\\circ} = \\frac{T}{\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{3}}} = T\\sqrt{3}$.\nIf $\\sin A = \\frac{T}{2b} < 1$, then there are two possible values for $\\angle A$, say $\\angle A_1$ and $\\angle A_2$, where $\\angle A_1 + \\angle A_2 = 180^\\circ$.\nWe have $b > \\frac{T}{2}$.\nAlso, we must have $b < a+c$, so $b < T+c$.\nWe have $c = \\frac{b \\sin C}{\\sin B} = \\frac{b \\sin C}{\\frac{1}{2}} = 2b \\sin C$.\nSince $\\angle C = 180^\\circ - \\angle A - \\angle B$, we have $\\angle C = 150^\\circ - \\angle A$.\nIf $\\angle A = 90^\\circ$, then $\\angle C = 150^\\circ - 90^\\circ = 60^\\circ$.\nThen $c = 2b \\sin 60^\\circ = 2b \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2} = b\\sqrt{3}$.\nWe have $c = b\\sqrt{3}$, so $c > b$.\nAlso, $a = T$, $b = T\\sqrt{3}$, and $c = T\\sqrt{3} \\sqrt{3} = 3T$.\nWe have $a+b > c$, so $T + T\\sqrt{3} > 3T$, which means $1 + \\sqrt{3} > 3$, which is false.\nWe need $b > \\frac{T}{2}$.\nAlso, we need $b < a+c$, so $b < T+c$.\nWe have $c = \\frac{b \\sin C}{\\sin B} = \\frac{b \\sin (150^\\circ - A)}{\\frac{1}{2}} = 2b \\sin (150^\\circ - A)$.\nSince $\\angle B = 30^\\circ$, we have two possible values for $\\angle A$ such that $\\sin A = \\frac{T}{2b}$.\nWe need $b > \\frac{T}{2}$.\nAlso, we need $b < a+c$, so $b < T+c$.\nWe have $c = \\frac{b \\sin C}{\\sin B} = \\frac{b \\sin (150^\\circ - A)}{\\frac{1}{2}} = 2b \\sin (150^\\circ - A)$.\nSince $\\sin A = \\frac{T}{2b}$, we have $\\angle A = \\arcsin \\frac{T}{2b}$.\nWe have $0 < \\frac{T}{2b} < 1$, so $b > \\frac{T}{2}$.\nAlso, we need $b < T+c$, so $b < T + 2b \\sin (150^\\circ - A)$.\nSince $\\angle A = \\arcsin \\frac{T}{2b}$, we have $\\angle A \\in (0^\\circ, 90^\\circ)$.\nIf $\\angle A = 90^\\circ$, then $b = \\frac{T}{2 \\sin 90^\\circ} = \\frac{T}{2}$.\nSince $b > \\frac{T}{2}$, we have $\\angle A < 90^\\circ$.\nWe need $b < T+c$, so $b < T + 2b \\sin (150^\\circ - A)$.\nWe have $b < T + 2b \\sin (150^\\circ - \\arcsin \\frac{T}{2b})$.\nIf $b = T\\sqrt{3}$, then $\\sin A = \\frac{T}{2T\\sqrt{3}} = \\frac{1}{2\\sqrt{3}}$, so $\\angle A \\approx 19.47^\\circ$.\nThen $\\angle C = 150^\\circ - 19.47^\\circ = 130.53^\\circ$.\nThen $c = 2T\\sqrt{3} \\sin 130.53^\\circ \\approx 2T\\sqrt{3} (0.777) \\approx 2.73T$.\nWe have $b > \\frac{T}{2}$, so $T\\sqrt{3} > \\frac{T}{2}$, which is true.\nAlso, $b < a+c$, so $T\\sqrt{3} < T + 2.73T$, which is true.\nWe want to find the number of integer values of $b$ such that $b > \\frac{T}{2}$.\nSince $T = 100$, we have $b > 50$.\nAlso, we need $b < a+c$, so $b < 100+c$.\nWe have $c = \\frac{b \\sin C}{\\sin 30^\\circ} = 2b \\sin C$.\nWe have $\\angle C = 150^\\circ - \\angle A$, so $c = 2b \\sin (150^\\circ - \\angle A)$.\nWe have $\\sin A = \\frac{100}{2b} = \\frac{50}{b}$.\nWe need $0 < \\frac{50}{b} < 1$, so $b > 50$.\nWe have $b < 100 + 2b \\sin (150^\\circ - \\angle A)$.\nWe have $50 < b < 100 + 2b \\sin (150^\\circ - \\arcsin \\frac{50}{b})$.\nWe want to find the number of integers $b$ such that $50 < b < 100 + 2b \\sin (150^\\circ - \\arcsin \\frac{50}{b})$.\nIf $b = 51$, then $\\sin A = \\frac{50}{51} \\approx 0.98$, so $\\angle A \\approx 78.46^\\circ$.\nThen $\\angle C = 150^\\circ - 78.46^\\circ = 71.54^\\circ$.\nThen $c = 2(51) \\sin 71.54^\\circ \\approx 102(0.947) \\approx 96.59$.\nWe have $51 < 100 + 96.59$, which is true.\nIf $b = 150$, then $\\sin A = \\frac{50}{150} = \\frac{1}{3}$, so $\\angle A \\approx 19.47^\\circ$.\nThen $\\angle C = 150^\\circ - 19.47^\\circ = 130.53^\\circ$.\nThen $c = 2(150) \\sin 130.53^\\circ \\approx 300(0.777) \\approx 233.1$.\nWe have $150 < 100 + 233.1$, which is true.\nWe need $b < a+c$, so $b < 100 + 2b \\sin (150^\\circ - \\arcsin \\frac{50}{b})$.\nWe have $50 < b < 100 + 2b \\sin (150^\\circ - \\arcsin \\frac{50}{b})$.\nThe maximum value of $b$ is when $\\angle A \\to 0^\\circ$, so $\\sin A \\to 0$.

{"question": "An $\\boldsymbol{n}$-label is a permutation of the numbers 1 through $n$. For example, $J=35214$ is a 5 -label and $K=132$ is a 3 -label. For a fixed positive integer $p$, where $p \\leq n$, consider consecutive blocks of $p$ numbers in an $n$-label. For example, when $p=3$ and $L=263415$, the blocks are 263,634,341, and 415. We can associate to each of these blocks a $p$-label that corresponds to the relative order of the numbers in that block. For $L=263415$, we get the following:\n\n$$\n\\underline{263} 415 \\rightarrow 132 ; \\quad 2 \\underline{63415} \\rightarrow 312 ; \\quad 26 \\underline{341} 5 \\rightarrow 231 ; \\quad 263 \\underline{415} \\rightarrow 213\n$$\n\nMoving from left to right in the $n$-label, there are $n-p+1$ such blocks, which means we obtain an $(n-p+1)$-tuple of $p$-labels. For $L=263415$, we get the 4 -tuple $(132,312,231,213)$. We will call this $(n-p+1)$-tuple the $\\boldsymbol{p}$-signature of $L$ (or signature, if $p$ is clear from the context) and denote it by $S_{p}[L]$; the $p$-labels in the signature are called windows.

Then $S_1 - S_2 \\equiv 0 \\pmod{11}$ and $S_1 + S_2 = 18$.\nThus $2 S_1 \\equiv 18 \\pmod{11}$, so $2 S_1 \\equiv 7 \\pmod{11}$.\nMultiplying by $6$, we have $12 S_1 \\equiv 42 \\pmod{11}$, so $S_1 \\equiv 9 \\pmod{11}$.\nThen $S_1 = 9$ and $S_2 = 9$.\nWe want to find the smallest $N$, so we should try to make the first digit as small as possible.\nWe need to find three digits that sum to $9$.\nPossible combinations are:\n\\begin{itemize}\n    \\item 1, 2, 6 (not possible)\n    \\item 1, 3, 5\n    \\item 1, 4, 4 (not possible)\n    \\item 2, 3, 4\n    \\item 3, 3, 3 (not possible)\n\\end{itemize}\nWe want to find the smallest possible value for $N$.\nLet's try to make the first digit $1$.

Then the equation is $\\frac{(x-7)^2}{7^2} + \\frac{(y-7)^2}{7^2} = 1$, which is a circle.\nSince the foci are $(3,7)$ and $(11,7)$, the center is $(7,7)$, and the distance from the center to each focus is $c=4$.\nSince the ellipse is tangent to the axes, we have $a=7$ and $b=7$. Then $c^2 = a^2 - b^2$, so $4^2 = 7^2 - 7^2 = 0$, which is a contradiction.\nWe have $c = 4$, and $a=7$. Then $b^2 = a^2 - c^2 = 7^2 - 4^2 = 49 - 16 = 33$. So $b = \\sqrt{33}$.\nSince the ellipse is tangent to the axes, we must have $a=7$ and $b=7$. But we found $b = \\sqrt{33}$, so this is a contradiction.\n\nLet the center of the ellipse be $(7,7)$. Then the equation of the ellipse is $\\frac{(x-7)^2}{a^2} + \\frac{(y-7)^2}{b^2} = 1$.\nSince the ellipse is tangent to the $x$-axis and $y$ axis, we must have $a=7$ and $b=7$.\nThe foci are $(3,7)$ and $(d,7)$. The center is $\\left(\\frac{3+d}{2}, 7\\right)$. Since the center is $(7,7)$, we have $\\frac{3+d}{2} = 7$, so $3+d = 14$, which means $d=11$.\nSince the foci are $(3,7)$ and $(11,7)$, we have $c = 4$. Then $c^2 = a^2 - b^2$, so $16 = a^2 - b^2$.\nSince the ellipse is tangent to the axes, we must have $a=7$ and $b=7$. But $16 = 7^2 - 7^2 = 0$, which is a contradiction.\nLet the foci be $F_1 = (3,7)$ and $F_2 = (d,7)$. The center is $C = \\left(\\frac{3+d}{2}, 7\\right)$.

Since the ellipse is tangent to the $x$-axis and $y$-axis, we have $h=k=a$.\nThe foci are $(3,7)$ and $(d,7)$. The center is $\\left(\\frac{3+d}{2}, 7\\right)$. Since the center is $(a,a)$, we have $a=7$ and $a=\\frac{3+d}{2}$.\nThus, $7 = \\frac{3+d}{2}$, so $14 = 3+d$, which gives $d=11$.\nThe distance from the center to each focus is $c$. So $c = |7-3| = 4$ and $c = |7-d|$.\nThus, $4 = |7-d|$. If $d=11$, then $|7-11| = |-4| = 4$, which is consistent.\nHowever, we are given that the answer is $-\\frac{11}{9}$.\n\nLet the center of the ellipse be $(h,k)$.

We can flip 1 and 2 in the first minute, and 2 and 3 in the second minute. Then all switches are on. So $E(3, 2) = 2$.\nIf $k=n-1$, we flip $n-1$ switches each minute. If $n=3$, we flip 1 and 2 in the first minute. Then switch 3 is off. In the second minute, we flip 2 and 3. Then switch 1 is off. In the third minute, we flip 1 and 3. Then all switches are on. So $E(3, 2) = 3$.\n\nLet $x_i$ be the number of times switch $i$ is flipped. We want to find the minimum number of minutes $m$ such that $x_i$ is odd for all $i$.\nWe flip $k$ switches each minute. So the total number of flips is $mk$. We want $x_i$ to be odd for all $i$.\nIf $k$ is odd, we can flip all $n$ switches. Then $x_i = m$ for all $i$. We need $m$ to be odd. So $m=2j+1$ for some integer $j$. Then $mk = (2j+1)k$.\nIf $k$ is even, we can flip $n$ switches. Then $x_i = m$ for all $i$. We need $m$ to be odd. So $m=2j+1$ for some integer $j$. Then $mk = (2j+1)k$.\n\nConsider the case $E(2020, 1993)$. We have $n=2020$ and $k=1993$.\nSince $k$ is odd, we can flip all $n$ switches. We want to find the minimum number of minutes $m$ such that $x_i$ is odd for all $i$.\nWe flip $k=1993$ switches each minute. We want to have all $n=2020$ switches on. So we need to flip each switch an odd number of times.\nLet $m$ be the number of minutes. Then the total number of flips is $mk = 1993m$. We want $x_i$ to be odd for all $i$.\nIf $m$ is odd, then $1993m$ is odd. If $m$ is even, then $1993m$ is even.\nWe want to find the minimum $m$ such that $x_i$ is odd for all $i$.\nWe can consider the case where we flip all $n$ switches each minute. Then $x_i = m$ for all $i$. We need $m$ to be odd. So $m=2j+1$ for some integer $j$.\nThen $mk = (2j+1)k$. We want to find the minimum $m$ such that $x_i$ is odd for all $i$.\nWe have $E(n, k) = \\lceil \\frac{n}{k} \\rceil$ if $n$ is odd, and $E(n, k) = \\lceil \\frac{n}{k} \\rceil$ if $k$ is odd.\nIn our case, $n=2020$ and $k=1993$. Since $k$ is odd, we have $E(2020, 1993) = \\lceil \\frac{2020}{1993} \\rceil = \\lceil 1.0135 \\rceil = 2$.\nHowever, we need to flip exactly $k=1993$ switches each minute. We have $n=2020$ switches.\nLet $m$ be the number of minutes. Then we flip $1993m$ switches in total. We want each switch to be flipped an odd number of times.\nWe want $1993m \\equiv 1 \\pmod{2}$, so $m$ must be odd. If $m=1$, then we flip 1993 switches. We have $2020-1993 = 27$ switches that are off.\nIf $m=2$, then we flip $1993 \\times 2 = 3986$ switches. Since $3986 > 2020$, we can flip each switch twice.\nLet $x_i$ be the number of times switch $i$ is flipped. We want $x_i$ to be odd for all $i$.\nWe can consider the case where we flip $k$ switches each minute. We want to find the minimum $m$ such that $x_i$ is odd for all $i$.\nIf $m=2$, then we flip $k$ switches twice. So $x_i = 2$ for all $i$. This is even.\nWe want to find the minimum $m$ such that $x_i$ is odd for all $i$.\nWe have $E(n, k) = \\lceil \\frac{n}{k} \\rceil$ if $n$ is odd, and $E(n, k) = \\lceil \\frac{n}{k} \\rceil$ if $k$ is odd.\nSince $n=2020$ and $k=1993$, we have $E(2020, 1993) = \\lceil \\frac{2020}{1993} \\rceil = 2$.\nHowever, we need to flip $k=1993$ switches each minute.

Then $PQ = \\sqrt{12^2 + (2h)^2}$, $QR = \\sqrt{12^2 + (2h)^2}$, $PR = \\sqrt{6^2 + (2h)^2}$.\nSince $PQ = QR$, we have $12^2 + 4h^2 = 6^2 + 4h^2$, which is impossible.\nLet $r_P, r_Q, r_R$ be the radii of the spheres. Then $PQ = r_P + r_Q$, $QR = r_Q + r_R$, $PR = r_R + r_P$.\nAlso, $P'Q' = 12$, $Q'R' = 12$, $P'R' = 6$.\nWe have $P'Q' = \\sqrt{(r_P+r_Q)^2 - (r_P-r_Q)^2} = 2 \\sqrt{r_P r_Q} = 12$.\n$Q'R' = \\sqrt{(r_Q+r_R)^2 - (r_Q-r_R)^2} = 2 \\sqrt{r_Q r_R} = 12$.\n$P'R' = \\sqrt{(r_R+r_P)^2 - (r_R-r_P)^2} = 2 \\sqrt{r_R r_P} = 6$.\nThus, $\\sqrt{r_P r_Q} = 6$, $\\sqrt{r_Q r_R} = 6$, $\\sqrt{r_R r_P} = 3$.\nSquaring these equations, we have $r_P r_Q = 36$, $r_Q r_R = 36$, $r_R r_P = 9$.\nMultiplying these equations, we have $(r_P r_Q r_R)^2 = 36^2 \\cdot 9 = 1296 \\cdot 9 = 11664$.\nSo $r_P r_Q r_R = \\sqrt{11664} = 108$.\nFrom $r_P r_Q = 36$, we have $r_R = \\frac{108}{36} = 3$.\nFrom $r_Q r_R = 36$, we have $r_Q = \\frac{36}{3} = 12$.\nFrom $r_R r_P = 9$, we have $r_P = \\frac{9}{3} = 3$.\nThen $PQ = r_P + r_Q = 3+12 = 15$, $QR = r_Q + r_R = 12+3 = 15$, $PR = r_R + r_P = 3+3 = 6$.\nThe area of $\\triangle PQR$ is $\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{4} \\cdot \\frac{PQ^2 + QR^2 + PR^2}{4} = \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{4} \\cdot \\frac{15^2 + 15^2 + 6^2}{4} = \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{16} (225+225+36) = \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{16} (486) = \\frac{243\\sqrt{3}}{8}$.\nLet $s = \\frac{15+15+6}{2} = \\frac{36}{2} = 18$.\nArea of $\\triangle PQR = \\sqrt{s(s-a)(s-b)(s-c)} = \\sqrt{18(18-15)(18-15)(18-6)} = \\sqrt{18(3)(3)(12)} = \\sqrt{18(9)(12)} = \\sqrt{1944} = \\sqrt{324 \\cdot 6} = 18 \\sqrt{6}$.\n\nFinal Answer: The final answer is $\\boxed{18\\sqrt{6}}$"], "id": 3075, "generated_answers": ["18\\sqrt{6}"], "gold_answer": "$18 \\sqrt{6}$", "is_correct": true, "answers_correctness": [true]}
