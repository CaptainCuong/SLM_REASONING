For example, the number \\(6\\) in binary is \\(110\\), so its weight is \\(2\\).\n\n### Step 2: Counting Numbers with Even and Odd Weights\nWe need to count the number of positive integers up to \\(2^{2017}\\) that have an even weight and those that have an odd weight.\n\n### Step 3: Binary Representation and Parity\nConsider the binary representation of numbers from \\(0\\) to \\(2^{2017} - 1\\). Each number can be represented as a 2017-bit binary string (since \\(2^{2017}\\) is a 2018-bit number, but we are considering numbers up to \\(2^{2017} - 1\\)).\n\n### Step 4: Parity of the Number of 1s\nThe parity (even or odd nature) of the number of 1s in a binary string is determined by the sum of the bits modulo 2. We can use the properties of binary strings to count the number of strings with even and odd weights.\n\n### Step 5: Using Combinatorics\nThe total number of 2017-bit binary strings is \\(2^{2017}\\). We need to count the number of these strings that have an even number of 1s and those that have an odd number of 1s.\n\n### Step 6: Symmetry in Binary Strings\nBy symmetry, the number of 2017-bit binary strings with an even number of 1s is equal to the number of 2017-bit binary strings with an odd number of 1s. This is because each bit can be flipped (0 to 1 or 1 to 0) without changing the total number of 1s modulo 2.\n\n### Step 7: Calculating the Difference\nSince the total number of 2017-bit binary strings is \\(2^{2017}\\), and half of them have an even number of 1s and the other half have an odd number of 1s, the difference between the number of positive integers with even weight and those with odd weight is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{0}\n\\]"], "id": 1612, "generated_answers": ["0"], "gold_answer": "$2^{1009}$", "is_correct": false, "answers_correctness": [false]}

We need to find the maximum number of cells that can all be covered by the same number of napkins, where this number is nonzero.\n\n### Step 2: Analyzing the Napkin Placement\nConsider the placement of a single \\( 52 \\times 52 \\) napkin on the grid. The number of cells covered by this napkin is:\n\\[\n52 \\times 52 = 2704\n\\]\n\n### Step 3: Overlapping Napkins\nTo maximize the number of cells that contain the same nonzero number, we need to consider the overlap of multiple napkins. If two napkins overlap, the cells in the overlap will be covered by both napkins.\n\n### Step 4: Calculating the Overlap\nThe maximum overlap of two \\( 52 \\times 52 \\) napkins occurs when they are placed such that their edges are aligned. The overlap will be a \\( 52 \\times 52 \\) square, but since the grid is \\( 2011 \\times 2011 \\), the actual overlap will be smaller.\n\n### Step 5: Determining the Maximum Overlap\nTo find the maximum number of cells that can be covered by the same number of napkins, we need to consider the largest possible overlap. The largest overlap occurs when the napkins are placed such that their centers are as close as possible without overlapping completely.\n\n### Step 6: Using the Pigeonhole Principle\nWe need to use the pigeonhole principle to determine the maximum number of cells that can be covered by the same number of napkins.

If we place 38 napkins in a way that maximizes the overlap, the maximum number of cells that can be covered by the same number of napkins is:\n\\[\nk = 38 \\times 2704 - 37 \\times 2704 = 2704\n\\]\n\nHowever, this is not the correct approach.

The left-hand side \\( x^2 + 7 \\) is a polynomial of degree 2. Each term \\( f_i(x)^2 \\) on the right-hand side is a polynomial of degree \\( 2 \\deg(f_i(x)) \\). For the degrees to match, the highest degree term on the right-hand side must be \\( x^2 \\). This implies that the degrees of the polynomials \\( f_i(x) \\) must be such that the highest degree term in the sum \\( f_1(x)^2 + f_2(x)^2 + \\cdots + f_n(x)^2 \\) is \\( x^2 \\).\n\n### Step 3: Coefficient Analysis\nNext, consider the constant term. The constant term on the left-hand side is 7. Each \\( f_i(x)^2 \\) contributes a non-negative constant term (since the square of any real number is non-negative). To sum to 7, we need at least two terms because a single square of a polynomial with rational coefficients cannot be 7 (since \\( f_i(x)^2 \\) must be a perfect square of a rational number, and no rational number squared equals 7).\n\n### Step 4: Constructing the Polynomials\nWe need to find polynomials \\( f_1(x) \\) and \\( f_2(x) \\) such that:\n\n\\[\nx^2 + 7 = f_1(x)^2 + f_2(x)^2.\n\\]\n\nLet's try to find such polynomials.

Consider the identity:\n\n\\[\n(a^2 + b^2)(c^2 + d^2) = (ac - bd)^2 + (ad + bc)^2.\n\\]\n\nWe can use this to construct our polynomials. Let:\n\n\\[\nf_1(x) = x \\quad \\text{and} \\quad f_2(x) = \\sqrt{7}.\n\\]\n\nHowever, we need rational polynomials. Instead, we can use:\n\n\\[\nf_1(x) = x \\quad \\text{and} \\quad f_2(x) = \\sqrt{7}.\n\\]\n\n### Step 6: Verification\nWe need to verify if we can find rational polynomials that satisfy the equation. Consider:\n\n\\[\nf_1(x) = x \\quad \\text{and} \\quad f_2(x) = \\sqrt{7}.\n\\]\n\nThis does not work because \\( \\sqrt{7} \\) is not rational. We need to find rational polynomials.\n\n### Step 7: Correct Approach\nWe need to find rational polynomials \\( f_1(x) \\) and \\( f_2(x) \\) such that:\n\n\\[\nx^2 + 7 = f_1(x)^2 + f_2(x)^2.\n\\]\n\nWe can use the identity:\n\n\\[\n(a^2 + b^2)(c^2 + d^2) = (ac - bd)^2 + (ad + bc)^2.\n\\]\n\nLet:\n\n\\[\nf_1(x) = x \\quad \\text{and} \\quad f_2(x) = \\sqrt{7}.\n\\]\n\nThis does not work because \\( \\sqrt{7} \\) is not rational.

This means that the denominator of the fraction, when simplified, must be of the form \\( 2^a \\cdot 5^b \\) for non-negative integers \\( a \\) and \\( b \\).\n\n### Step 2: Analyzing the Fraction \\(\\frac{10^t - 1}{c \\cdot m}\\)\nThe number \\( 10^t - 1 \\) is a repunit, which is a number consisting of \\( t \\) digits all equal to 9. For example, \\( 10^3 - 1 = 999 \\).\n\nFor \\(\\frac{10^t - 1}{c \\cdot m}\\) to be a short rational number, the denominator \\( c \\cdot m \\) must be such that the fraction simplifies to a form where the denominator is \\( 2^a \\cdot 5^b \\).\n\n### Step 3: Conditions for \\( t \\) to be \\( m \\)-tastic\nFor \\( t \\) to be \\( m \\)-tastic, there must exist a \\( c \\in \\{1, 2, 3, \\ldots, 2017\\} \\) such that:\n1. \\(\\frac{10^t - 1}{c \\cdot m}\\) is a short rational number.\n2. \\(\\frac{10^k - 1}{c \\cdot m}\\) is not a short rational number for any \\( 1 \\leq k < t \\).\n\n### Step 4: Determining the Maximum Number of Elements in \\( S(m) \\)\nTo find the maximum number of elements in \\( S(m) \\), we need to consider the possible values of \\( t \\) that satisfy the conditions for different values of \\( m \\).\n\nThe key insight is that the length of the repeating decimal of \\(\\frac{1}{m}\\) is at most \\( \\phi(m) \\), where \\( \\phi \\) is the Euler's totient function. This is because the repeating decimal of \\(\\frac{1}{m}\\) has a period that divides \\( \\phi(m) \\).\n\nFor \\( t \\) to be \\( m \\)-tastic, \\( t \\) must be the smallest integer such that \\( 10^t \\equiv 1 \\pmod{m} \\).

The maximum value of \\( \\text{ord}_m(10) \\) is the largest integer \\( t \\) such that \\( 10^t \\equiv 1 \\pmod{m} \\) for some \\( m \\).\n\nGiven the constraints, the maximum number of elements in \\( S(m) \\) is 4.

The board can be uniquely partitioned into \\( 1 \\times 2 \\) and \\( 2 \\times 1 \\) dominoes.\n2.

Therefore, the total number of dominoes required to cover the entire board is:\n\\[\n\\frac{4n^2}{2} = 2n^2\n\\]\n\n### Step 3: Marking Cells\nTo ensure a unique partition, we need to place the marked cells in such a way that they do not affect the ability to place the dominoes in a unique manner. The key is to place the marked cells in a way that they force a specific placement of the dominoes.\n\n### Step 4: Strategy for Placing Marked Cells\nConsider the following strategy:\n- Place marked cells in a checkerboard pattern, but with a slight modification to ensure uniqueness.\n\n### Step 5: Checkerboard Pattern\nA standard checkerboard pattern on a \\( 2n \\times 2n \\) board would have \\( 2n^2 \\) cells, half of which are marked. However, this does not necessarily ensure a unique partition. We need to modify this pattern.\n\n### Step 6: Modified Checkerboard Pattern\nWe can place marked cells in a modified checkerboard pattern where:\n- Mark every other cell in the first row.\n- Mark every other cell in the second row, but shift the pattern by one cell to the right.\n- Continue this pattern for all rows.\n\nThis pattern ensures that:\n- Each domino must cover one marked cell and one unmarked cell.\n- The placement of dominoes is forced in a unique way.\n\n### Step 7: Counting Marked Cells\nIn this modified checkerboard pattern, we mark:\n- \\( n \\) cells in the first row.\n- \\( n \\) cells in the second row, shifted by one cell.\n- This pattern repeats for all \\( n \\) rows.\n\nThus, the total number of marked cells is:\n\\[\nk = n^2\n\\]\n\n### Step 8: Verification\nTo verify, consider a \\( 4 \\times 4 \\) board (where \\( n = 2 \\)):\n- Mark cells in the pattern: (1,1), (1,3), (2,2), (2,4), (3,1), (3,3), (4,2), (4,4).\n- This pattern ensures a unique partition into \\( 1 \\times 2 \\) and \\( 2 \\times 1 \\) dominoes.\n\n### Conclusion\nThe smallest positive integer \\( k \\) that satisfies the given conditions is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{n^2}\n\\]"], "id": 1854, "generated_answers": ["n^2"], "gold_answer": "$2 n$", "is_correct": false, "answers_correctness": [false]}

{"question": "Let $n$ be a positive integer. Harry has $n$ coins lined up on his desk, each showing heads or tails. He repeatedly does the following operation: if there are $k$ coins showing heads and $k>0$, then he flips the $k^{\\text {th }}$ coin over; otherwise he stops the process. (For example, the process starting with THT would be THT $\\rightarrow H H T \\rightarrow H T T \\rightarrow T T T$, which takes three steps.)\n\nLetting $C$ denote the initial configuration (a sequence of $n H$ 's and $T$ 's), write $\\ell(C)$ for the number of steps needed before all coins show $T$. Show that this number $\\ell(C)$ is finite, and determine its average value over all $2^{n}$ possible initial configurations $C$.", "generated_responses": ["To solve the problem, we need to show that the number of steps \\(\\ell(C)\\) needed for all coins to show tails is finite and determine its average value over all possible initial configurations \\(C\\).\n\n### Step 1: Show that \\(\\ell(C)\\) is finite\nWe start by noting that each coin can only be flipped a finite number of times. Specifically, a coin showing heads will be flipped at most once, and a coin showing tails will never be flipped. Therefore, the process will eventually stop when all coins show tails.\n\nTo see this more formally, consider the following:\n- If a coin showing heads is flipped, it will show tails in the next step.\n- If a coin showing tails is flipped, it will remain tails.\n\nThus, the number of heads in the configuration decreases by at least one with each flip. Since there are only \\(n\\) coins, the number of heads can decrease from \\(n\\) to \\(0\\) in at most \\(n\\) steps. Therefore, \\(\\ell(C)\\) is finite and \\(\\ell(C) \\leq n\\).\n\n### Step 2: Determine the average value of \\(\\ell(C)\\)\nTo find the average value of \\(\\ell(C)\\) over all possible initial configurations \\(C\\), we need to consider the expected number of steps required to reach the all-tails configuration.\n\nWe will use the linearity of expectation to simplify the calculation. Let \\(X_i\\) be the indicator random variable for the event that the \\(i\\)-th coin is flipped at least once during the process. The total number of steps \\(\\ell(C)\\) is the sum of the number of times each coin is flipped:\n\\[\n\\ell(C) = \\sum_{i=1}^n X_i\n\\]\n\nBy the linearity of expectation:\n\\[\n\\mathbb{E}[\\ell(C)] = \\mathbb{E}\\left[\\sum_{i=1}^n X_i\\right] = \\sum_{i=1}^n \\mathbb{E}[X_i]\n\\]\n\nWe need to find \\(\\mathbb{E}[X_i]\\), the probability that the \\(i\\)-th coin is flipped at least once. The \\(i\\)-th coin is flipped if and only if it is the \\(k\\)-th coin in the sequence of heads, where \\(k\\) is the number of heads at that step. The probability that the \\(i\\)-th coin is the \\(k\\)-th coin in the sequence of heads is the same for all \\(i\\) and \\(k\\).\n\nTo find this probability, we consider the expected number of steps it takes for a specific coin to be flipped. The expected number of steps for a coin to be flipped is the same for all coins, and it can be shown that this expected value is 2. This is because each coin has a 50% chance of being flipped in any given step, and the expected number of steps to flip a coin is the reciprocal of this probability, which is 2.\n\nThus, the expected number of times each coin is flipped is:\n\\[\n\\mathbb{E}[X_i] = 2 - 1 = 1\n\\]\n\nHowever, this is incorrect. The correct expected number of times each coin is flipped is actually 1, because each coin is flipped exactly once in the process. Therefore:\n\\[\n\\mathbb{E}[X_i] = 1\n\\]\n\nSumming over all \\(n\\) coins, we get:\n\\[\n\\mathbb{E}[\\ell(C)] = \\sum_{i=1}^n \\mathbb{E}[X_i] = \\sum_{i=1}^n 1 = n\n\\]\n\nHowever, this is incorrect. The correct expected number of steps is:\n\\[\n\\mathbb{E}[\\ell(C)] = n - 1\n\\]\n\nThus, the average value of \\(\\ell(C)\\) over all possible initial configurations \\(C\\) is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{n-1}\n\\]"], "id": 1914, "generated_answers": ["n-1"], "gold_answer": "$\\frac{1}{4} n(n+1)$", "is_correct": false, "answers_correctness": [false]}

This means that the gcd of the two numbers \\( f(m) + n \\) and \\( f(n) + m \\) must be a divisor of \\( k \\).\n\n### Step 2: Analyzing the Function \\( f \\)\nTo find such a function \\( f \\), we need to consider the properties of the gcd and how \\( f \\) behaves. Let's start by assuming \\( f \\) is a function that satisfies the condition for some \\( k \\).\n\n### Step 3: Testing Small Values of \\( k \\)\n#### Case \\( k = 1 \\)\nIf \\( k = 1 \\), then \\(\\operatorname{gcd}(f(m) + n, f(n) + m) \\leq 1\\).

This means a knight can attack up to 8 squares on a standard chessboard.\n\n### Step 2: Placing Knights on the Board\nTo maximize the number of knights, we need to ensure that no knight attacks another. One effective strategy is to place the knights on a subset of the board where the knights do not attack each other.\n\n### Step 3: Using a Chessboard Coloring Strategy\nWe can use a coloring strategy to place the knights. Consider a \\(20 \\times 20\\) chessboard and color it in a checkerboard pattern (alternating black and white squares). In this pattern, no knight can attack another knight if they are both on the same color.\n\n### Step 4: Counting the Number of Knights\nOn a \\(20 \\times 20\\) chessboard, there are 400 squares. In a checkerboard pattern, half of the squares are black and half are white. Therefore, there are 200 black squares and 200 white squares.\n\n### Step 5: Placing Knights on One Color\nHorst can place knights on all the black squares or all the white squares. Since there are 200 black squares and 200 white squares, Horst can place up to 200 knights on the board without any knight attacking another.\n\n### Step 6: Considering Queenie's Moves\nQueenie places a white queen on an empty square. The queen can attack any square in the same row, column, or diagonal. However, this does not affect the placement of the knights, as the knights are placed on a checkerboard pattern and do not attack each other.\n\n### Step 7: Conclusion\n regardless of how Queenie places her queens, Horst can always place up to 200 knights on the board without any knight attacking another. Therefore, the maximal positive \\(K\\) such that Horst can put at least \\(K\\) knights on the board is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{200}\n\\]"], "id": 2037, "generated_answers": ["200"], "gold_answer": "100", "is_correct": false, "answers_correctness": [false]}

The key is to find the minimum number of lines required to achieve this.\n\n### Step 3: Using the Pigeonhole Principle\nConsider the convex hull of all 4027 points. The convex hull is the smallest convex polygon that contains all the points. The number of vertices of the convex hull is at most 4027.\n\n### Step 4: Separating the Points\nTo separate the points, we can use the fact that any line can divide the plane into two half-planes.

Since we have 2013 red points and 2014 blue points, we can place the lines such that each region contains points of only one color.

However, it confirms that \\( f \\) is well-defined.\n\n### Step 3: Substitute \\( y = -x f(x) \\)\nNow, let's substitute \\( y = -x f(x) \\) into the original equation:\n\n\\[\nf(x f(x) - x f(x)) = f(-x f(x)) + x^2 \\implies f(0) = f(-x f(x)) + x^2\n\\]\n\nRearranging this, we get:\n\n\\[\nf(-x f(x)) = f(0) - x^2\n\\]\n\n### Step 4: Compare with the earlier result\nFrom Step 1, we have:\n\n\\[\nf(x f(x)) = f(0) + x^2\n\\]\n\nWe now have two equations:\n\n1. \\( f(x f(x)) = f(0) + x^2 \\)\n2. \\( f(-x f(x)) = f(0) - x^2 \\)\n\n### Step 5: Consider \\( f \\) as an odd function\nLet's assume \\( f \\) is an odd function, i.e., \\( f(-z) = -f(z) \\) for all \\( z \\in \\mathbb{Q} \\).

Bianca vs. Chen and Alain vs. Dave\n\n### Step 3: Calculate the probability for each scenario\n#### Scenario 1: Alain vs. Bianca and Chen vs. Dave\n- Probability that Alain wins against Bianca: \\(\\frac{1}{2}\\)\n- Probability that Chen wins against Dave: \\(1 - p\\)\n- Probability that Alain wins the final match: \\(\\frac{1}{2}\\)\n\nThe total probability for this scenario is:\n\\[\n\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right) \\times \\left(1 - p\\right) \\times \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right) = \\frac{1}{4} (1 - p)\n\\]\n\n#### Scenario 2: Alain vs. Chen and Bianca vs. Dave\n- Probability that Alain wins against Chen: \\(\\frac{1}{2}\\)\n- Probability that Bianca wins against Dave: \\(1 - p\\)\n- Probability that Alain wins the final match: \\(\\frac{1}{2}\\)\n\nThe total probability for this scenario is:\n\\[\n\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right) \\times \\left(1 - p\\right) \\times \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right) = \\frac{1}{4} (1 - p)\n\\]\n\n#### Scenario 3: Bianca vs. Chen and Alain vs. Dave\n- Probability that Bianca wins against Chen: \\(\\frac{1}{2}\\)\n- Probability that Alain wins against Dave: \\(1 - p\\)\n- Probability that Bianca wins the final match: \\(\\frac{1}{2}\\)\n\nThe total probability for this scenario is:\n\\[\n\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right) \\times \\left(1 - p\\right) \\times \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right) = \\frac{1}{4} (1 - p)\n\\]\n\n### Step 4: Sum the probabilities of the scenarios where Bianca wins\nBianca wins the tournament if she wins the final match. We need to consider the scenarios where Bianca wins the final match:\n- Scenario 3: Bianca vs. Chen and Alain vs. Dave\n\nThe total probability for Bianca winning the tournament is:\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{4} (1 - p)\n\\]\n\n### Step 5: Express the final answer in the required form\nThe probability that Bianca wins the tournament is:\n\\[\n\\frac{1 - p}{4}\n\\]\n\nTo match the form \\(\\frac{a p^2 + b p + c}{d}\\), we can rewrite it as:\n\\[\n\\frac{0 p^2 - p + 1}{4}\n\\]\n\nThus, the final answer is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{\\frac{-p + 1}{4}}\n\\]"], "id": 2333, "generated_answers": ["\\frac{-p + 1}{4}"], "gold_answer": "$\\frac{1-p^{2}}{3}$", "is_correct": false, "answers_correctness": [false]}

Each digit \\( d_i \\) in the number must satisfy \\( 1 \\leq d_i \\leq 9 \\) for the first digit and \\( 0 \\leq d_i \\leq 9 \\) for the other digits.\n\n### Step 2: Simplifying the Problem\nWe can use the stars and bars method to count the number of solutions to the equation:\n\\[ d_1 + d_2 + \\cdots + d_n = 5 \\]\nwhere \\( 1 \\leq d_1 \\leq 9 \\) and \\( 0 \\leq d_i \\leq 9 \\) for \\( i = 2, 3, \\ldots, n \\).\n\n### Step 3: Transforming the Equation\nLet \\( d_1' = d_1 - 1 \\).

The height \\(h\\) of the isosceles triangle can be found using the properties of a 30-60-90 triangle:\n\\[\nh = \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2} \\cdot 1 = \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}\n\\]\nThe base of the isosceles triangle is \\(\\sqrt{3}\\). Therefore, the area \\(A\\) of the isosceles triangle is:\n\\[\nA = \\frac{1}{2} \\cdot \\text{base} \\cdot \\text{height} = \\frac{1}{2} \\cdot \\sqrt{3} \\cdot \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2} = \\frac{1}{2} \\cdot \\frac{3}{2} = \\frac{3}{4}\n\\]\n\n### Step 3: Count the Number of Each Type of Triangle\nIn a regular hexagon, there are:\n- 6 equilateral triangles\n- 14 isosceles triangles\n\n### Step 4: Calculate the Total Area of All Triangles\nThe total area of the 6 equilateral triangles is:\n\\[\n6 \\cdot \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{4} = \\frac{6\\sqrt{3}}{4} = \\frac{3\\sqrt{3}}{2}\n\\]\n\nThe total area of the 14 isosceles triangles is:\n\\[\n14 \\cdot \\frac{3}{4} = \\frac{42}{4} = \\frac{21}{2}\n\\]\n\n### Step 5: Calculate the Average Area\nThe total area of all 20 triangles is:\n\\[\n\\frac{3\\sqrt{3}}{2} + \\frac{21}{2} = \\frac{3\\sqrt{3} + 21}{2}\n\\]\n\nThe average area is:\n\\[\n\\frac{\\text{Total Area}}{\\text{Number of Triangles}} = \\frac{\\frac{3\\sqrt{3} + 21}{2}}{20} = \\frac{3\\sqrt{3} + 21}{40}\n\\]\n\n### Final Answer\n\\[\n\\boxed{\\frac{21 + 3\\sqrt{3}}{40}}\n\\]"], "id": 2706, "generated_answers": ["\\frac{21 + 3\\sqrt{3}}{40}"], "gold_answer": "$\\frac{9 \\sqrt{3}}{20}$", "is_correct": false, "answers_correctness": [false]}

Specifically:\n- \\( s_1 = f(1) + f(2) + \\cdots + f(20) \\)\n- \\( s_2 = f(f(1)) + f(f(2)) + \\cdots + f(f(20)) \\)\n- \\( s_3 = f(f(f(1))) + f(f(f(2))) + \\cdots + f(f(f(20))) \\)\n- and so on.\n\n### Step 2: Periodicity of \\( f \\)\nSince \\( f \\) maps \\( S \\) to itself, \\( f \\) is a function on a finite set.

The worst-case scenario is when \\( f \\) is a permutation of \\( S \\) with the longest cycle length equal to the number of elements in \\( S \\), which is 20.\n\nHowever, we need to find the smallest \\( p \\) that guarantees periodicity for any function \\( f \\).

The sum of the elements of \\( S \\) is:\n\\[ \\sum_{k=1}^{20} k = \\frac{20 \\cdot 21}{2} = 210 \\]\n\n### Step 5: Sum of Iterates\nThe sum of the \\( n \\)-th iterates of \\( f \\) applied to each element of \\( S \\) will eventually repeat because the function \\( f \\) is finite and the sum of the elements of \\( S \\) is fixed.

We aim to minimize the sum of these integers.\n\nLet's denote the three consecutive integers as \\( n-1 \\), \\( n \\), and \\( n+1 \\). We need to determine which of these is the mean, median, and mode.\n\n### Step 1: Determine the mode\nThe mode is the number that appears most frequently in the list. Since the mode is unique, it must appear more times than any other number in the list.\n\n### Step 2: Determine the median\nThe median is the middle number when the list is sorted. If the list has an odd number of elements, the median is the middle element. If the list has an even number of elements, the median is the average of the two middle elements.\n\n### Step 3: Determine the mean\nThe mean is the sum of all the integers in the list divided by the number of elements in the list.\n\n### Step 4: Construct the list\nWe need to construct a list where the mean, median, and mode are \\( n-1 \\), \\( n \\), and \\( n+1 \\) in some order.

{"question": "An $\\boldsymbol{n}$-label is a permutation of the numbers 1 through $n$. For example, $J=35214$ is a 5 -label and $K=132$ is a 3 -label. For a fixed positive integer $p$, where $p \\leq n$, consider consecutive blocks of $p$ numbers in an $n$-label. For example, when $p=3$ and $L=263415$, the blocks are 263,634,341, and 415. We can associate to each of these blocks a $p$-label that corresponds to the relative order of the numbers in that block. For $L=263415$, we get the following:\n\n$$\n\\underline{263} 415 \\rightarrow 132 ; \\quad 2 \\underline{63415} \\rightarrow 312 ; \\quad 26 \\underline{341} 5 \\rightarrow 231 ; \\quad 263 \\underline{415} \\rightarrow 213\n$$\n\nMoving from left to right in the $n$-label, there are $n-p+1$ such blocks, which means we obtain an $(n-p+1)$-tuple of $p$-labels. For $L=263415$, we get the 4 -tuple $(132,312,231,213)$. We will call this $(n-p+1)$-tuple the $\\boldsymbol{p}$-signature of $L$ (or signature, if $p$ is clear from the context) and denote it by $S_{p}[L]$; the $p$-labels in the signature are called windows.

Compute the number of colorings such that every triangle $A_{i} A_{j} A_{k}$ has at least one red side.", "generated_responses": ["To solve the problem, we need to determine the number of ways to color the diagonals of a convex hexagon such that every triangle formed by the vertices of the hexagon has at least one red side. Let's break down the problem step by step.\n\n### Step 1: Identify the Triangles\nA convex hexagon has 20 triangles. These triangles can be formed by choosing any 3 vertices out of the 6 vertices of the hexagon. The number of ways to choose 3 vertices out of 6 is given by the combination formula:\n\\[\n\\binom{6}{3} = 20\n\\]\n\n### Step 2: Color Constraints\nWe need to ensure that each of these 20 triangles has at least one red side. The sides of the hexagon are already red, so we only need to consider the diagonals.\n\n### Step 3: Diagonals and Triangles\nThe hexagon has 9 diagonals. Each diagonal can be either red or blue. We need to count the number of ways to color these 9 diagonals such that no triangle is formed with all three sides blue.\n\n### Step 4: Complementary Counting\nWe will use complementary counting to find the number of valid colorings. First, we count the total number of ways to color the 9 diagonals, and then subtract the number of ways that result in at least one triangle with all three sides blue.\n\n#### Total Number of Colorings\nEach of the 9 diagonals can be either red or blue, so the total number of colorings is:\n\\[\n2^9 = 512\n\\]\n\n#### Invalid Colorings\nWe need to count the number of colorings where at least one triangle has all three sides blue. We will use the principle of inclusion-exclusion to do this.\n\n### Step 5: Principle of Inclusion-Exclusion\nLet \\( A_i \\) be the set of colorings where the \\( i \\)-th triangle has all three sides blue. We need to find \\( |A_1 \\cup A_2 \\cup \\cdots \\cup A_{20}| \\).\n\nUsing the principle of inclusion-exclusion:\n\\[\n|A_1 \\cup A_2 \\cup \\cdots \\cup A_{20}| = \\sum_{i=1}^{20} |A_i| - \\sum_{1 \\leq i < j \\leq 20} |A_i \\cap A_j| + \\sum_{1 \\leq i < j < k \\leq 20} |A_i \\cap A_j \\cap A_k| - \\cdots\n\\]\n\n#### Single Triangle\nFor a single triangle, there are 6 diagonals that can be blue, and the remaining 3 diagonals must be red. The number of ways to color the diagonals such that a specific triangle has all three sides blue is:\n\\[\n2^6 = 64\n\\]\nThus, \\( |A_i| = 64 \\) for each \\( i \\).\n\n#### Two Triangles\nFor two triangles, there are 3 common diagonals and 6 unique diagonals. The number of ways to color the diagonals such that both triangles have all three sides blue is:\n\\[\n2^3 = 8\n\\]\nThus, \\( |A_i \\cap A_j| = 8 \\) for each pair \\( (i, j) \\).\n\n#### Three Triangles\nFor three triangles, there are 3 common diagonals and 3 unique diagonals. The number of ways to color the diagonals such that all three triangles have all three sides blue is:\n\\[\n2^0 = 1\n\\]\nThus, \\( |A_i \\cap A_j \\cap A_k| = 1 \\) for each triple \\( (i, j, k) \\).\n\n### Step 6: Calculate the Number of Invalid Colorings\nUsing the principle of inclusion-exclusion:\n\\[\n|A_1 \\cup A_2 \\cup \\cdots \\cup A_{20}| = 20 \\cdot 64 - \\binom{20}{2} \\cdot 8 + \\binom{20}{3} \\cdot 1\n\\]\n\\[\n= 20 \\cdot 64 - 190 \\cdot 8 + 1140 \\cdot 1\n\\]\n\\[\n= 1280 - 1520 + 1140\n\\]\n\\[\n= 800\n\\]\n\n### Step 7: Calculate the Number of Valid Colorings\nThe number of valid colorings is the total number of colorings minus the number of invalid colorings:\n\\[\n512 - 800 = 240\n\\]\n\nThus, the number of colorings such that every triangle \\( A_i A_j A_k \\) has at least one red side is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{240}\n\\]"], "id": 2953, "generated_answers": ["240"], "gold_answer": "392", "is_correct": false, "answers_correctness": [false]}

Therefore, the total number of possible colorings is:\n\\[\n2^6 = 64\n\\]\n\n### Step 2: Counting Valid Colorings\nWe need to count the number of colorings where no three faces of the same color share a common vertex.
