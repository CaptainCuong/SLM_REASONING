We want to find the largest integer $x$ such that $6a + 10b + 15c = x$ has no non-negative integer solutions for $a, b, c$.\n\nWe can rewrite the equation as $6a + 10b + 15c = x$. Since $6, 10, 15$ are all divisible by $1$, we can express any integer as a linear combination of $6, 10, 15$. However, we want to find the largest integer that cannot be expressed in this form.\nWe can divide the equation by the greatest common divisor of $6, 10, 15$, which is $\\gcd(6, 10, 15) = 1$.\nWe can write $6a + 10b + 15c = 2(3a + 5b + \\frac{15}{2}c)$. Since $a, b, c$ are integers, $3a + 5b + \\frac{15}{2}c$ must be an integer. Thus, $c$ must be an even integer. Let $c = 2k$ for some non-negative integer $k$. Then we have $6a + 10b + 30k = x$.\nWe can divide by 2 to get $3a + 5b + 15k = \\frac{x}{2}$. Since $a, b, k$ are integers, $\\frac{x}{2}$ must be an integer, so $x$ must be even.\nLet $x = 2y$. Then $3a + 5b + 15k = y$.\nWe want to find the largest integer $y$ that cannot be written in the form $3a + 5b + 15k$.\nSince $\\gcd(3, 5) = 1$, we can express any integer as a linear combination of 3 and 5.\nThe largest integer that cannot be written in the form $3a + 5b$ is given by the Chicken McNugget Theorem: $3 \\cdot 5 - 3 - 5 = 15 - 8 = 7$.\nSo, any integer greater than 7 can be written in the form $3a + 5b$.\nNow we want to find the largest integer $y$ that cannot be written in the form $3a + 5b + 15k$.\nSince $15$ is a multiple of both $3$ and $5$, we can write $15k = 3(5k) = 5(3k)$.\nWe can write $y = 3a + 5b + 15k = 3(a + 5k) + 5b$. Let $a' = a + 5k$.

If $y > 7$, then $y = 3a' + 5b$ for some integers $a', b$.\nWe can write $a' = a + 5k$, so $y = 3(a + 5k) + 5b = 3a + 15k + 5b = 3a + 5b + 15k$.\nThus, any integer greater than 7 can be written in the form $3a + 5b + 15k$.\nThe largest integer that cannot be written in the form $3a + 5b + 15k$ is 7.\nHowever, we are looking for the largest integer $x$ that cannot be written in the form $6a + 10b + 15c$.\nSince $x$ must be even, we are looking for the largest even integer that cannot be written in the form $6a + 10b + 15c$.\nWe have $6a + 10b + 15c = 2(3a + 5b + \\frac{15}{2}c)$. Since $c$ must be even, let $c = 2k$. Then $6a + 10b + 30k = 2(3a + 5b + 15k)$.\nSo we want to find the largest integer $y$ such that $3a + 5b + 15k = y$ has no solution.\nWe know that the largest integer that cannot be written in the form $3a + 5b$ is 7.\nSo the largest integer that cannot be written in the form $3a + 5b + 15k$ is 7.\nThen $x = 2y = 2(7) = 14$.\nHowever, $14 = 2(6) + 2(1)$, so $14 = 6(0) + 10(1) + 15(0) + 4$, which is not possible.\nWe have $6a + 10b + 15c = x$.\nWe can write $6a + 10b + 15c = 6a + 10b + 15(2k) = 6a + 10b + 30k$.\nWe can write $6a + 10b = 2(3a + 5b)$.\nThe largest integer that cannot be
