{"question": "Take the total energy (potential plus thermal) of the Sun to be given by the simple expression:\n\\[\nE \\simeq-\\frac{G M^{2}}{R}\n\\]\nwhere $M$ and $R$ are the mass and radius, respectively.

Assume that the total energy of the Sun is always given by the above expression, even as $R$ gets smaller. By writing down a simple (differential) equation relating the power radiated at Sun's surface with the change in its total energy (using the above expression), integrate this equation to find the time (in years) for the Sun to shrink to $1 / 2$ its present radius.

We want the smallest positive $k$, so we choose $n=0$, which gives $k = \\frac{\\pi}{6}$.\nThen $\\phi = \\frac{\\pi}{6}$, and $x(t) = A \\cos (\\omega t - \\frac{\\pi}{6})$.\n$x(0) = A \\cos (-\\frac{\\pi}{6}) = A \\cos (\\frac{\\pi}{6}) = A \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2} \\neq 0$.\nWe need $\\cos \\phi = 0$, so $\\phi = \\frac{\\pi}{2} + n\\pi$.\nWe want $\\phi$ to be an odd multiple of $k$, so $\\phi = (2m+1)k$.\nWe have $(2m+1)k = \\frac{\\pi}{2} + n\\pi$.\n$k = \\frac{\\pi}{2(2m+1)} + \\frac{n\\pi}{2m+1} = \\frac{\\pi + 2n\\pi}{2(2m+1)} = \\frac{(2n+1)\\pi}{2(2m+1)}$.\nWe want the smallest positive $k$.\nIf $m=0$, then $k = \\frac{(2n+1)\\pi}{2}$. We choose $n=0$, so $k = \\frac{\\pi}{2}$.\nIf $m=1$, then $k = \\frac{(2n+1)\\pi}{6}$. We choose $n=0$, so $k = \\frac{\\pi}{6}$.\nIf $m=2$, then $k = \\frac{(2n+1)\\pi}{10}$. We choose $n=0$, so $k = \\frac{\\pi}{10}$.\nWe want to find the smallest positive $k$ such that $x(0) = 0$ for all functions $x(t) = A \\cos (\\omega t - \\phi)$ where $\\phi$ is an odd multiple of $k$.\nWe have $x(0) = A \\cos (-\\phi) = A \\cos \\phi = 0$. Since $A \\neq 0$, we have $\\cos \\phi = 0$.\nThus $\\phi = \\frac{\\pi}{2} + n\\pi$ for some integer $n$.\nSince $\\phi$ is an odd multiple of $k$, we have $\\phi = (2m+1)k$ for some integer $m$.\nSo $(2m+1)k = \\frac{\\pi}{2} + n\\pi$.\n$k = \\frac{\\pi}{2(2m+1)} + \\frac{n\\pi}{2m+1} = \\frac{\\pi + 2n\\pi}{2(2m+1)} = \\frac{(2n+1)\\pi}{2(2m+1)}$.\nWe want the smallest positive $k$, so we choose $m=0$, $n=0$, which gives $k = \\frac{\\pi}{2}$.\nIf we choose $m=1$, $n=0$, we get $k = \\frac{\\pi}{6}$.\nIf we choose $m=2$, $n=0$, we get $k = \\frac{\\pi}{10}$.\nThe smallest positive $k$ is $\\frac{\\pi}{10}$.\n\nFinal Answer: The final answer is $\\boxed{\\frac{\\pi}{10}}$"], "generated_answers": ["\\frac{\\pi}{10}"], "gold_answer": "\\frac{\\pi}{2}", "is_correct": false, "answers_correctness": [false]}
