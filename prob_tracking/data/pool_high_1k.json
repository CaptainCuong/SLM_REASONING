    "input": "Flora the frog starts at 0 on the number line and makes a sequence of jumps to the right. In any one jump, independent of previous jumps, Flora leaps a positive integer distance $m$ with probability $\\frac{1}{2^m}$.\nWhat is the probability that Flora will eventually land at 10? Write the answer as a simplified fraction $\\frac{m}{n}$, find $m+n$",
    "output": ".\n\nAssistant: To solve this problem, we need to determine the probability that Flora the frog will eventually land on the number 10. We can use the concept of an infinite series to model this problem.\n\nLet's denote the probability that Flora will eventually land on 10 as \\(P(10)\\). We can express \\(P(10)\\) in terms of the probabilities of landing on 10 from other positions. Specifically, Flora can jump to 10 from positions 9, 8, 7, etc., with the respective probabilities of jumping those distances.\n\nThe probability of landing on 10 from position \\(k\\) is given by the probability of landing on \\(k\\) and then jumping to 10. Since the probability of jumping a distance \\(m\\) is \\(\\frac{1}{2^m}\\), we can write the following equation for \\(P(10)\\):\n\n\\[P(10) = \\sum_{m=1}^{\\infty} \\frac{1}{2^m} P(10-m)\\]\n\nThis equation states that the probability of landing on 10 is the sum of the probabilities of landing on 10 from each possible previous position, weighted by the probability of jumping to that position.\n\nTo solve this, we can use the fact that the probability of eventually landing on any positive integer \\(n\\) is the same for all \\(n\\), because the problem is symmetric and the probabilities of jumping are the same for all distances. Let's denote this probability as \\(P\\). Then we have:\n\n\\[P = \\sum_{m=1}^{\\infty} \\frac{1}{2^m} P = P \\sum_{m=1}^{\\infty} \\frac{1}{2^m}\\]\n\nThe sum \\(\\sum_{m=1}^{\\infty} \\frac{1}{2^m}\\) is a geometric series that sums to 1. Therefore, we have:\n\n\\[P = P \\cdot 1\\]\n\nThis equation is true for any \\(P\\), but we need to consider the boundary condition. Since Flora starts at 0, the probability of eventually landing on 0 is 1. Therefore, the probability of eventually landing on any positive integer is the same, and we can use the fact that the sum of the probabilities of landing on all positive integers must be 1.\n\nSince the probability of landing on any positive integer is the same, and there are infinitely many positive integers, the probability of landing on any specific positive integer is \\(\\frac{1}{\\infty} = 0\\). However, this is not the correct interpretation for this problem. Instead, we need to consider the probability of eventually landing on 10, which is the same as the probability of eventually landing on any other positive integer.\n\nThe correct approach is to recognize that the probability of eventually landing on 10 is the same as the probability of eventually landing on any other positive integer, and this probability is given by the sum of the probabilities of landing on 10 from each possible previous position, weighted by the probability of jumping to that position.\n\nSince the probability of landing on 10 from any previous position is the same, we can write:\n\n\\[P(10) = \\sum_{m=1}^{\\infty} \\frac{1}{2^m} P(10) = P(10) \\sum_{m=1}^{\\infty} \\frac{1}{2^m} = P(10) \\cdot 1 = P(10)\\]\n\nThis equation is true for any \\(P(10)\\), but we need to consider the boundary condition.

We denote this probability by \\( P(k, n) \\). The probability that Flora lands at position \\( k \\) after \\( n \\) jumps is the sum of the probabilities of all possible sequences of \\( n \\) jumps that sum to \\( k \\).\n\nThe probability of a single jump of length \\( m \\) is given by:\n\\[\nP(m) = \\frac{1}{2^m}\n\\]\n\nWe need to find the probability that Flora lands at position 10 at some point.

To find this coefficient, we can use the binomial theorem and properties of generating functions.\n\nThe coefficient of \\( x^{10} \\) in \\( \\frac{x^{10}}{(2 - x)^9 (2 - 2x)} \\) is the same as the coefficient of \\( x^0 \\) in \\( \\frac{1}{(2 - x)^9 (2 - 2x)} \\).
