    "output": "To determine the density of copper at \\(100^\\circ \\text{C}\\), we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Convert the lattice constant to cm:**\n   The lattice constant given is \\(3.655 \\AA\\). To convert this to cm, we use the conversion factor \\(1 \\AA = 10^{-8} \\text{ cm}\\):\n   \\[\n   3.655 \\AA = 3.655 \\times 10^{-8} \\text{ cm}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Calculate the volume of the unit cell:**\n   The unit cell of a cubic lattice is a cube with side length equal to the lattice constant. Therefore, the volume \\(V\\) of the unit cell is:\n   \\[\n   V = (3.655 \\times 10^{-8} \\text{ cm})^3\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   V = (3.655)^3 \\times (10^{-8})^3 \\text{ cm}^3\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   (3.655)^3 \\approx 62.3703375 \\text{ cm}^3\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   V \\approx 62.3703375 \\times 10^{-24} \\text{ cm}^3\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   V \\approx 6.24 \\times 10^{-23} \\text{ cm}^3\n   \\]\n\n3. **Determine the number of copper atoms per unit volume:**\n   For a cubic lattice, the number of atoms per unit volume is the reciprocal of the volume of the unit cell:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Number of atoms per cm}^3 = \\frac{1}{6.24 \\times 10^{-23} \\text{ cm}^3}\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   \\text{Number of atoms per cm}^3 \\approx 1.60 \\times 10^{22} \\text{ atoms}\n   \\]\n\n4. **Calculate the mass of one copper atom:**\n   The molar mass of copper is \\(63.546 \\text{ g/mol}\\). To find the mass of one atom, we use the formula:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Mass of one atom} = \\frac{63.546 \\text{ g}}{6.022 \\times 10^{23} \\text{ atoms}} \\approx 1.059 \\times 10^{-22} \\text{ g}\n   \\]\n\n5. **Calculate the mass of copper in one unit volume:**\n   The mass of copper in one cm\\(^3\\) is the product of the number of atoms per cm\\(^3\\) and the mass of one atom:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Mass per cm}^3 = 1.60 \\times 10^{22} \\text{ atoms} \\times 1.059 \\times 10^{-22} \\text{ g/atom} \\approx 1.6944 \\text{ g}\n   \\]\n\n6. **Final calculation:**\n   \\[\n   \\boxed{1.69}\n   \\]",
