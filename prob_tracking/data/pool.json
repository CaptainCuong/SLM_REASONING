    "input": "Question: If $f(x)$ is a polynomial of degree 7, and $g(x)$ is a polynomial of degree 7, then what is the product of the minimum and the maximum possible degrees of $f(x) + g(x)$?\n  Solution:To solve this problem, we need to consider the degrees of the polynomials \\( f(x) \\) and \\( g(x) \\) and how their degrees affect the degree of the polynomial \\( f(x) + g(x) \\).\n\n1. **Degrees of \\( f(x) \\) and \\( g(x) \\)**:\n   - Both \\( f(x) \\) and \\( g(x) \\) are polynomials of degree 7. This means the highest power of \\( x \\) in both \\( f(x) \\) and \\( g(x) \\) is \\( x^7 \\).\n\n2. **Degree of \\( f(x) + g(x) \\)**:\n   - The degree of the sum of two polynomials is determined by the highest degree term that does not cancel out.\n   - The maximum possible degree of \\( f(x) + g(x) \\) occurs when the leading coefficients of \\( f(x) \\) and \\( g(x) \\) do not cancel each other out. In this case, the degree of \\( f(x) + g(x) \\) is 7.\n   - The minimum possible degree of \\( f(x) + g(x) \\) occurs when the leading coefficients of \\( f(x) \\) and \\( g(x) \\) are exactly opposite in sign and equal in magnitude, causing the \\( x^7 \\) terms to cancel out. In this case, the degree of \\( f(x) + g(x) \\) is less than 7. The lowest possible degree is 0, which occurs if all terms cancel out, resulting in a constant polynomial.\n\n3. **Product of the minimum and maximum possible degrees**:\n   - The maximum possible degree of \\( f(x) + g(x) \\) is 7.\n   - The minimum possible degree of \\( f(x) + g(x) \\) is 0.\n   - The product of these degrees is \\( 7 \\times 0 = 0 \\).\n\nThus, the product of the minimum and maximum possible degrees of \\( f(x) + g(x) \\) is \\(\\boxed{0}\\).",
    "output": "We're given two polynomials, *f(x)* and *g(x)*, both with a degree of 7. When you add these polynomials together, the highest possible degree of the resulting polynomial is 7. This happens if the *x*<sup>7</sup> terms in *f(x)* and *g(x)* don't cancel each other out.\n\nHowever, the *x*<sup>7</sup> terms *could* cancel out completely if *f(x)* and *g(x)* have opposite coefficients for the *x*<sup>7</sup> term. In the best-case scenario for cancellation, *all* the terms could cancel, leaving just a constant – which has a degree of 0.\n\nTherefore, the highest possible degree of *f(x) + g(x)* is 7, and the lowest possible degree is 0.  The problem asks for the product of these minimum and maximum degrees, which is 7 * 0 = 0.\n\n\n\n",
