        "input": "If $f(x)$ is a polynomial of degree 7, and $g(x)$ is a polynomial of degree 7, then what is the product of the minimum and the maximum possible degrees of $f(x) + g(x)$?",
        "output": "To solve this problem, we need to consider the degrees of the polynomials \\(f(x)\\) and \\(g(x)\\) and how they combine when we add them together.\n\n1. **Degree of \\(f(x) + g(x)\\) when \\(f(x)\\) and \\(g(x)\\) have the same leading coefficient:**\n   - If \\(f(x)\\) and \\(g(x)\\) have the same leading coefficient, then the leading terms of \\(f(x)\\) and \\(g(x)\\) will cancel each other out when we add them. This means the degree of \\(f(x) + g(x)\\) will be less than 7. The maximum possible degree of \\(f(x) + g(x)\\) in this case is 6.\n\n2. **Degree of \\(f(x) + g(x)\\) when \\(f(x)\\) and \\(g(x)\\) have different leading coefficients:**\n   - If \\(f(x)\\) and \\(g(x)\\) have different leading coefficients, then the leading terms of \\(f(x)\\) and \\(g(x)\\) will not cancel each other out. This means the degree of \\(f(x) + g(x)\\) will be 7. The minimum possible degree of \\(f(x) + g(x)\\) in this case is 7.\n\nSo, the minimum possible degree of \\(f(x) + g(x)\\) is 0 (if \\(f(x) = -g(x)\\) and they cancel each other out completely, resulting in the zero polynomial), and the maximum possible degree of \\(f(x) + g(x)\\) is 7.\n\nThe product of the minimum and the maximum possible degrees of \\(f(x) + g(x)\\) is \\(0 \\times 7 = 0\\).\n\nLet's confirm this with Python code to ensure accuracy.\n```python\n# Define the degrees of the polynomials f(x) and g(x)\ndegree_f = 7\ndegree_g = 7\n\n# Calculate the minimum and maximum possible degrees of f(x) + g(x)\nmin_degree = 0  # This is the minimum possible degree when f(x) = -g(x)\nmax_degree = max(degree_f, degree_g)  # This is the maximum possible degree when the leading coefficients are different\n\n# Calculate the product of the minimum and maximum possible degrees\nproduct = min_degree * max_degree\nprint(product)\n```\n```output\n0\n```\nThe product of the minimum and the maximum possible degrees of \\(f(x) + g(x)\\) is \\(\\boxed{0}\\).",
