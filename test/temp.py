sol_deepseek = "<think>\nOkay, so I need to find the speed of the ship in still water and the speed of the river. Let me start by recalling that when a ship is moving upstream, its effective speed is the speed of the ship minus the speed of the river. Conversely, when moving downstream, its effective speed is the ship's speed plus the river's speed. \n\nLet me denote the speed of the ship in still water as \\( v \\) (in km/h) and the speed of the river as \\( r \\) (also in km/h). Then, the upstream speed would be \\( v - r \\), and the downstream speed would be \\( v + r \\).\n\nThe problem mentions three different journeys:\n\n1. 24 km upstream and 28 km downstream, taking half an hour less than the second journey.\n2. 30 km upstream and 21 km downstream, which takes half an hour more than the first journey.\n3. 15 km upstream and 42 km downstream, which takes half an hour less than the first journey.\n\nWait, actually, the problem states: \"For this journey, it took half an hour less than for traveling 30 km upstream and 21 km downstream, or half an hour more than for traveling 15 km upstream and 42 km downstream...\"\n\nHmm, let me parse that again. The first journey (24 km upstream, 28 km downstream) took half an hour less than the journey with 30 km upstream and 21 km downstream. Alternatively, it took half an hour more than the journey with 15 km upstream and 42 km downstream. So, there are two comparisons here:\n\n- Time for 24 up + 28 down = Time for 30 up + 21 down - 0.5 hours\n- Time for 24 up + 28 down = Time for 15 up + 42 down + 0.5 hours\n\nTherefore, we can set up two equations based on these time differences.\n\nFirst, let me express the time taken for each journey. Time is equal to distance divided by speed. So, for the first journey (24 km up, 28 km down):\n\nTime1 = \\( \\frac{24}{v - r} + \\frac{28}{v + r} \\)\n\nFor the second journey (30 km up, 21 km down):\n\nTime2 = \\( \\frac{30}{v - r} + \\frac{21}{v + r} \\)\n\nAccording to the problem, Time1 = Time2 - 0.5\n\nSimilarly, for the third journey (15 km up, 42 km down):\n\nTime3 = \\( \\frac{15}{v - r} + \\frac{42}{v + r} \\)\n\nAnd here, Time1 = Time3 + 0.5\n\nSo, we have two equations:\n\n1. \\( \\frac{24}{v - r} + \\frac{28}{v + r} = \\frac{30}{v - r} + \\frac{21}{v + r} - 0.5 \\)\n2. \\( \\frac{24}{v - r} + \\frac{28}{v + r} = \\frac{15}{v - r} + \\frac{42}{v + r} + 0.5 \\)\n\nOkay, so now I need to solve these two equations for \\( v \\) and \\( r \\).\n\nLet me first work on the first equation:\n\n\\( \\frac{24}{v - r} + \\frac{28}{v + r} = \\frac{30}{v - r} + \\frac{21}{v + r} - 0.5 \\)\n\nLet me subtract \\( \\frac{24}{v - r} + \\frac{28}{v + r} \\) from both sides, but maybe it's better to bring all terms to the left side:\n\n\\( \\frac{24}{v - r} + \\frac{28}{v + r} - \\frac{30}{v - r} - \\frac{21}{v + r} + 0.5 = 0 \\)\n\nSimplify the terms:\n\nFor the upstream terms: \\( 24 - 30 = -6 \\), so \\( \\frac{-6}{v - r} \\)\n\nFor the downstream terms: \\( 28 - 21 = 7 \\), so \\( \\frac{7}{v + r} \\)\n\nSo, the equation becomes:\n\n\\( \\frac{-6}{v - r} + \\frac{7}{v + r} + 0.5 = 0 \\)\n\nSimilarly, for the second equation:\n\n\\( \\frac{24}{v - r} + \\frac{28}{v + r} - \\frac{15}{v - r} - \\frac{42}{v + r} - 0.5 = 0 \\)\n\nSimplify:\n\nUpstream terms: \\( 24 - 15 = 9 \\), so \\( \\frac{9}{v - r} \\)\n\nDownstream terms: \\( 28 - 42 = -14 \\), so \\( \\frac{-14}{v + r} \\)\n\nThus:\n\n\\( \\frac{9}{v - r} - \\frac{14}{v + r} - 0.5 = 0 \\)\n\nNow, we have two equations:\n\n1. \\( -\\frac{6}{v - r} + \\frac{7}{v + r} + 0.5 = 0 \\)\n2. \\( \\frac{9}{v - r} - \\frac{14}{v + r} - 0.5 = 0 \\)\n\nLet me denote \\( x = \\frac{1}{v - r} \\) and \\( y = \\frac{1}{v + r} \\). Then, the equations become:\n\n1. \\( -6x + 7y + 0.5 = 0 \\) ⇒ \\( -6x + 7y = -0.5 \\)\n2. \\( 9x - 14y - 0.5 = 0 \\) ⇒ \\( 9x - 14y = 0.5 \\)\n\nNow, we have a system of linear equations:\n\nEquation (1): \\( -6x + 7y = -0.5 \\)\n\nEquation (2): \\( 9x - 14y = 0.5 \\)\n\nLet me solve this system using the elimination method. Let's multiply Equation (1) by 2 to make the coefficients of y terms opposites:\n\nEquation (1) multiplied by 2: \\( -12x + 14y = -1 \\)\n\nNow, add this to Equation (2):\n\n\\( (-12x + 14y) + (9x -14y) = -1 + 0.5 \\)\n\nSimplify:\n\n\\( -3x = -0.5 \\)\n\nThus, \\( x = (-0.5)/(-3) = 0.5/3 ≈ 0.1667 \\)\n\nBut exact value is \\( x = 1/6 \\)\n\nNow, substitute \\( x = 1/6 \\) back into Equation (1):\n\n\\( -6*(1/6) + 7y = -0.5 \\)\n\nSimplify:\n\n\\( -1 + 7y = -0.5 \\)\n\nAdd 1 to both sides:\n\n7y = 0.5\n\nThus, \\( y = 0.5/7 = 1/14 ≈ 0.0714 \\)\n\nSo, \\( x = 1/6 \\) and \\( y = 1/14 \\)\n\nRecall that \\( x = \\frac{1}{v - r} = 1/6 \\) ⇒ \\( v - r = 6 \\)\n\nSimilarly, \\( y = \\frac{1}{v + r} = 1/14 \\) ⇒ \\( v + r = 14 \\)\n\nTherefore, we have two equations:\n\n1. \\( v - r = 6 \\)\n2. \\( v + r = 14 \\)\n\nAdding these equations:\n\n\\( (v - r) + (v + r) = 6 + 14 \\)\n\nSimplify:\n\n\\( 2v = 20 \\) ⇒ \\( v = 10 \\)\n\nSubstituting back into \\( v + r = 14 \\):\n\n\\( 10 + r = 14 \\) ⇒ \\( r = 4 \\)\n\nSo, the speed of the ship in still water is 10 km/h, and the speed of the river is 4 km/h.\n\nLet me verify these results by plugging them back into the original time equations.\n\nFirst journey: 24/(10-4) + 28/(10+4) = 24/6 + 28/14 = 4 + 2 = 6 hours.\n\nSecond journey: 30/(10-4) + 21/(10+4) = 30/6 + 21/14 = 5 + 1.5 = 6.5 hours. So, 6.5 - 0.5 = 6 hours, which matches the first journey. Good.\n\nThird journey: 15/(10-4) + 42/(10+4) = 15/6 + 42/14 = 2.5 + 3 = 5.5 hours. Then, 5.5 + 0.5 = 6 hours, which also matches the first journey. Perfect.\n\nTherefore, the solution is correct.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe speed of the ship in still water is \\boxed{10} km/h and the speed of the river is \\boxed{4} km/h.\n</think>\n\nLet \\( v \\) be the speed of the ship in still water (in km/h) and \\( r \\) be the speed of the river (in km/h). The effective speeds of the ship upstream and downstream are \\( v - r \\) and \\( v + r \\), respectively.\n\nWe are given three journeys with the following time relationships:\n1. The journey of 24 km upstream and 28 km downstream takes half an hour less than the journey of 30 km upstream and 21 km downstream.\n2. The journey of 24 km upstream and 28 km downstream takes half an hour more than the journey of 15 km upstream and 42 km downstream.\n\nWe set up the equations for the times taken for each journey:\n1.

## Solution.

Let $t$ be the time required for the boat to travel $24 \mathrm{~km}$ upstream and $28 \mathrm{~km}$ downstream, $v_{R}$ the speed of the river, and $v_{B}$ the speed of the boat. When the boat is traveling upstream, its speed is $v_{B}-v_{R}$, and when it is traveling downstream, its speed is $v_{B}+v_{R}$.

Since $t=\frac{s}{v}$, from the given data, we obtain the following system of equations:

$\left\{\begin{array}{l}t=\frac{24}{v_{B}-v_{R}}+\frac{28}{v_{B}+v_{R}} \\ t+0.5=\frac{30}{v_{B}-v_{R}}+\frac{21}{v_{B}+v_{R}} \\ t-0.5=\frac{15}{v_{B}-v_{R}}+\frac{42}{v_{B}+v_{R}}\end{array}\right.$

By introducing new variables $x=\frac{3}{v_{B}-v_{R}}, y=\frac{7}{v_{B}+v_{R}}$, the system transforms into:

$\left\{\begin{array}{l}t=8 x+4 y \\ t+0.5=10 x+3 y \\ t-0.5=5 x+6 y\end{array}\right.$

Substituting $t$ from the first equation into the remaining two, we get:

$\left\{\begin{array}{l}8 x+4 y+0.5=10 x+3 y \\ 8 x+4 y-0.5=5 x+6 y\end{array}\right.$

$\left\{\begin{array}{l}2 x-y=0.5 \\ 3 x-2 y=0.5\end{array}\right.$

The solution to the last system is (0.5, 0.5). Then we have:

$\frac{3}{v_{B}-v_{R}}=0.5$, hence, $v_{B}-v_{R}=6 \mathrm{~and}$

$\frac{7}{v_{B}+v_{R}}=0.5$, hence, $v_{B}+v_{R}=14$.

The speed of the river is $v_{R}=4 \mathrm{~km} / \mathrm{h}$, and the speed of the boat is $v_{B}=10 \mathrm{~km} / \mathrm{h}$.

## Note:

By substituting $x=\frac{1}{v_{B}-v_{R}}, y=\frac{1}{v_{B}+v_{R}} \mathrm{~and}$ following the same procedure, the initial system transforms into the system $\left\{\begin{array}{l}6 x-7 y=0.5 \\ 9 x-14 y=0.5\end{array}\right.$

The solution to this system is $\left(\frac{1}{6}, \frac{1}{14}\right)$.
