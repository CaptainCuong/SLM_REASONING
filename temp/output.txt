Please reason step by step, and put your final answer within \boxed{}. 53. How many four-digit numbers contain at least one even digit?

Output:
ers contain at least one even digit, we can use the principle of complementary counting. Specifically, we will find the total number of four-digit numbers and subtract the number of four-digit numbers that contain no even digits (i.e., all odd digits).

1. **Total number of four-digit numbers**:
   - The first digit (thousands place) can be any digit from 1 to 9 (9 choices).
   - The other three digits (hundreds, tens, and units places) can be any digit from 0 to 9 (10 choices each).
   - So, the total number of four-digit numbers is \(9 \times 10 \times 10 \times 10 = 9000\).

2. **Number of four-digit numbers with all odd digits**:
   - The first digit (thousands place) can be any odd digit from 1, 3, 5, 7, 9 (5 choices).
   - The other three digits (hundreds, tens, and units places) can be any odd digit from 1, 3, 5, 7, 9 (5 choices each).
   - So, the number of four-digit numbers with all odd digits is \(5 \times 5 \times 5 \times 5 = 625\).

3. **Number of four-digit numbers with at least one even digit**:
   - This is the total number of four-digit numbers minus the number of four-digit numbers with all odd digits.
   - So, the number of four-digit numbers with at least one even digit is \(9000 - 625 = 8375\).

Let's confirm this with Python code.
```python
# Total number of four-digit numbers
total_four_digit_numbers = 9 * 10 * 10 * 10

# Number of four-digit numbers with all odd digits
odd_digit_numbers = 5 * 5 * 5 * 5

# Number of four-digit numbers with at least one even digit
at_least_one_even_digit = total_four_digit_numbers - odd_digit_numbers

print(at_least_one_even_digit)
```
```output
8375
```
The number of four-digit numbers that contain at least one even digit is \(\boxed{8375}\).
